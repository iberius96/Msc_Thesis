## Abstract
The creation of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is often a challenging endeavor which requires to satisfactorily summarise the insights found in the collected research whilst, 
at the same time, being able to identify any potential gaps that might surface from the conducted analysis. The difficulty associated with this task can be especially prominent when 
dealing with relatively underexplored domains, where the lack of dedicated secondary studies might further complicate the process of defining the appropriate methodological 
structure required to devise a grounded review procedure.

This work provides what the authors believe to be the first SLR entirely dedicated to exploring research tied to the task of topic labeling. In addition to the straightforward 
contribution associated with providing a comprehensive summary of the insights derived from the relevant primary studies in the period 2017-2022, the many considerations made 
throughout the review process allowed to formulate a set of methodological contributions capable of enhancing established guidelines for conducting secondary studies and which are 
believed to be generally applicable by authors operating outside of the specific boundaries imposed by the domain analysed within the context of this work. These contributions 
include, among others, the use of existing quality metrics in the venue selection and snowballing phases and the introduction of suitable proximity operators in the employed search 
strategy.

Ultimately, the findings and observations derived from the included 108 primary studies are broken down and analysed with regards to four research questions, which seek to explore 
the current state-of-the-art associated with topic labeling research with regards to: (1) The identified macrocategories of labeling approaches and the specific techniques 
characterising each category, together with the motivational context provided by authors for justifying the employment a labeling step. (2) The topic modeling activities conducted 
to generate the underlying topic distributions. (3) The structure of the generated identifiers and the implemented label selection and quality evaluation procedures. (4) 
The categories of corpora and related document types exploited as the basis for the encountered analyses. Additionally, data associated with this initial synthesis is used as a means 
to identify notable research gaps arising from the collected studies. Lastly, a few insights derived from individual documents and selected on the basis of their accessibility and 
reproducibility are highlighted as a way to guide readers in the task of identifying pre-existing labeling techniques that could conceptually be utilised in their respective 
research.
