@article{lin_2021_preserve_integrity_in_realtime_event_summarization,
	abstract = {Online text streams such as Twitter are the major information source for users when they are looking for ongoing events. Realtime event summarization aims to generate and update coherent and concise summaries to describe the state of a given event. Due to the enormous volume of continuously coming texts, realtime event summarization has become the de facto tool to facilitate information acquisition. However, there exists a challenging yet unexplored issue in current text summarization techniques: how to preserve the integrity, i.e., the accuracy and consistency of summaries during the update process. The issue is critical since online text stream is dynamic and conflicting information could spread during the event period. For example, conflicting numbers of death and injuries might be reported after an earthquake. Such misleading information should not appear in the earthquake summary at any timestamp. In this article, we present a novel realtime event summarization framework called IAEA (i.e., Integrity-Aware Extractive-Abstractive realtime event summarization). Our key idea is to integrate an inconsistency detection module into a unified extractive--abstractive framework. In each update, important new tweets are first extracted in an extractive module, and the extraction is refined by explicitly detecting inconsistency between new tweets and previous summaries. The extractive module is able to capture the sentence-level attention which is later used by an abstractive module to obtain the word-level attention. Finally, the word-level attention is leveraged to rephrase words. We conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets. To reduce efforts required for building sufficient training data, we also provide automatic labeling steps of which the effectiveness has been empirically verified. Through experiments, we demonstrate that IAEA can generate better summaries with consistent information than state-of-the-art approaches.},

We pretrain a unigram document model as a variational autoencoder on in-domain, unlabeled data and use its internal states as features in a downstream classifier. Empirically, we show the relative strength of VAMPIRE against computationally expensive contextual embeddings and other popular semi-supervised baselines under low resource settings. We also find that fine-tuning to in-domain data is crucial to achieving decent performance from contextual embeddings when working with limited supervision. We accompany this paper with code to pretrain and use VAMPIRE embeddings in downstream tasks.},

@inproceedings{lu_2021_cross_structural_factor_topic_model_document_analysis_with_sophisticated_covariates,
	abstract = {Modern text data is increasingly gathered in situations where it is paired with a  high-dimensional collection of covariates:  then both the text, the covariates, and their relationships are of interest to analyze. Despite the growing amount of such data, current topic models are unable to take into account large amounts of covariates successfully:  they fail to model structure among covariates and distort findings of both text and covariates. This paper presents a solution: a novel factor-topic model that enables researchers to analyze latent structure in both text and sophisticated document-level covariates collectively. The key innovation is that besides learning the underlying topical structure,  the model also learns the underlying factorial structure from the covariates and the interactions between the two structures.  A set of tailored variational inference algorithms for efficient computation are provided.  Experiments on three different datasets show the model outperforms comparable topic models in the ability to predict held-out document content.  Two case studies focusing on Finnish parliamentary election candidates and game players on Steam demonstrate the model discovers semantically meaningful topics, factors, and their interactions.  The model both outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy and offers new factor-topic insights beyond other topic models.},

Especially when contributing to research on topics with worldwide impacts like energy policy, objective analyses and reliable datasets are necessary. We contribute toward this goal in two ways: first, we release two diachronic corpora covering 23 years of energy discussions in the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Secondly, we propose a simple and theoretically sound method for automatic topic labelling drawing on political thesauri. We empirically evaluate the quality of our labels, and apply our labelling to topics induced by diachronic topic models on our energy corpora, and present a detailed analysis.},

@article{hoyle_2022_are_neural_topic_models_broken,
	abstract = {Recently, the relationship between automated and human evaluation of topic models has been called into question. Method developers have staked the efficacy of new topic model variants on automated measures, and their failure to approximate human preferences places these models on uncertain ground. Moreover, existing evaluation paradigms are often divorced from real-world use. Motivated by content analysis as a dominant real-world use case for topic modeling, we analyze two related aspects of topic models that affect their effectiveness and trustworthiness in practice for that purpose: the stability of their estimates and the extent to which the model's discovered categories align with human-determined categories in the data. We find that neural topic models fare worse in both respects compared to an established classical method. We take a step toward addressing both issues in tandem by demonstrating that a straightforward ensembling method can reliably outperform the members of the ensemble.},

@article{zhu_2022_disentangled_learning_of_stance_and_aspect_topics_for_vaccine_attitude_detection_in_social_media,
	abstract = {Building models to detect vaccine attitudes on social media is challenging because of the composite, often intricate aspects involved, and the limited availability of annotated data. Existing approaches have relied heavily on supervised training that requires abundant annotations and pre-defined aspect categories. Instead, with the aim of leveraging the large amount of unannotated data now available on vaccination, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach for vaccine attitude detection, called VADet. A variational autoencoding architecture based on language models is employed to learn from unlabelled data the topical information of the domain. Then, the model is fine-tuned with a few manually annotated examples of user attitudes. We validate the effectiveness of VADet on our annotated data and also on an existing vaccination corpus annotated with opinions on vaccines. Our results show that VADet is able to learn disentangled stance and aspect topics, and outperforms existing aspect-based sentiment analysis models on both stance detection and tweet clustering.},

@techreport{wang_2021_neural_labeled_lda_a_topic_model_for_semi_supervised_document_classification,
	abstract = {Abstract
          Recently, some statistical topic modeling approaches based on LDA have been applied in the field of supervised document classification, where the model generation procedure incorporates prior knowledge to improve the classification performance. However, these customizations of topic modeling are limited by the cumbersome derivation of a specific inference algorithm for each modification. In this paper, we propose a new supervised topic modeling approach for   document classification problems, Neural Labeled LDA (NL-LDA), which builds on the VAE framework, and designs a special generative network to incorporate prior information. The proposed model can support semi-supervised learning based on the  manifold   assumption and  low-density   assumption. Meanwhile, NL-LDA has a consistent and concise inference method while semi-supervised learning and predicting. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate our model has outstanding performance on supervised document classification relative to the compared approaches, including traditional statistical and neural topic models. Specially, the proposed model can support both single-label and multi-label document classification. The proposed NL-LDA performs significantly well on semi-supervised classification, especially under a small amount of labeled data. Further comparisons with related works also indicate our model is competitive with state-of-the-art topic modeling approaches on semi-supervised classification.},

@article{yan_2022_hierarchical_interpretation_of_neural_text_classification,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in developing interpretable models in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Most existing models aim at identifying input features such as words or phrases important for model predictions. Neural models developed in NLP, however, often compose word semantics in a hierarchical manner. As such, interpretation by words or phrases only cannot faithfully explain model decisions in text classification. This article proposes a novel Hierarchical Interpretable Neural Text classifier, called Hint, which can automatically generate explanations of model predictions in the form of label-associated topics in a hierarchical manner. Model interpretation is no longer at the word level, but built on topics as the basic semantic unit. Experimental results on both review datasets and news datasets show that our proposed approach achieves text classification results on par with existing state-of-the-art text classifiers, and generates interpretations more faithful to model predictions and better understood by humans than other interpretable neural text classifiers.},

Fueled by its flexibility in the formulation and strong modeling power of the latent space, recent works built upon it have made interesting attempts aiming at the interpretability of text modeling. However, latent space EBMs also inherit some flaws from EBMs in data space; the degenerate MCMC sampling quality in practice can lead to poor generation quality and instability in training, especially on data with complex latent structures. Inspired by the recent efforts that leverage diffusion recovery likelihood learning as a cure for the sampling issue, we introduce a novel symbiosis between the diffusion models and latent space EBMs in a variational learning framework, coined as the latent diffusion energy-based model. We develop a geometric clustering-based regularization jointly with the information bottleneck to further improve the quality of the learned latent space. Experiments on several challenging tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our model on interpretable text modeling over strong counterparts.},

NTM-DMIE is a neural network method for topic learning which maximizes the mutual information between the input documents and their latent topic representation. To learn robust topic representation, we incorporate the discriminator to discriminate negative examples and positive examples via adversarial learning. Moreover, we use both global and local mutual information to preserve the rich information of the input documents in the topic representation. We evaluate NTM-DMIE on several metrics, including accuracy of text clustering, with topic representation, topic uniqueness and topic coherence. Compared to the existing methods, the experimental results show that NTM-DMIE can outperform in all the metrics on the four datasets.},

@article{wang_2022_representing_mixtures_of_word_embeddings_with_mixtures_of_topic_embeddings,
	abstract = {A topic model is often formulated as a generative model that explains how each word of a document is generated given a set of topics and document-specific topic proportions. It is focused on capturing the word co-occurrences in a document and hence often suffers from poor performance in analyzing short documents. In addition, its parameter estimation often relies on approximate posterior inference that is either not scalable or suffers from large approximation error. This paper introduces a new topic-modeling framework where each document is viewed as a set of word embedding vectors and each topic is modeled as an embedding vector in the same embedding space. Embedding the words and topics in the same vector space, we define a method to measure the semantic difference between the embedding vectors of the words of a document and these of the topics, and optimize the topic embeddings to minimize the expected difference over all documents. Experiments on text analysis demonstrate that the proposed method, which is amenable to mini-batch stochastic gradient descent based optimization and hence scalable to big corpora, provides competitive performance in discovering more coherent and diverse topics and extracting better document representations.},

One of the reasons behind this is vaccine disinformation which widely spreads in social media. In particular, recent surveys have established that vaccine disinformation is impacting negatively citizen trust in COVID-19 vaccination. At the same time, fact-checkers are struggling with detecting and tracking of vaccine disinformation, due to the large scale of social media. To assist fact-checkers in monitoring vaccine narratives online, this paper studies a new vaccine narrative classification task, which categorises COVID-19 vaccine claims into one of seven categories. Following a data augmentation approach, we first construct a novel dataset for this new classification task, focusing on the minority classes. We also make use of fact-checker annotated data. The paper also presents a neural vaccine narrative classifier that achieves an accuracy of 84\% under cross-validation. The classifier is publicly available for researchers and journalists.},

@article{song_2021_classification_aware_neural_topic_model_for_covid_19_disinformation_categorisation,
	abstract = {The explosion of disinformation accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic has overloaded fact-checkers and media worldwide, and brought a new major challenge to government responses worldwide. Not only is disinformation creating confusion about medical science amongst citizens, but it is also amplifying distrust in policy makers and governments. To help tackle this, we developed computational methods to categorise COVID-19 disinformation. The COVID-19 disinformation categories could be used for a) focusing fact-checking efforts on the most damaging kinds of COVID-19 disinformation; b) guiding policy makers who are trying to deliver effective public health messages and counter effectively COVID-19 disinformation. This paper presents: 1) a corpus containing what is currently the largest available set of manually annotated COVID-19 disinformation categories; 2) a classification-aware neural topic model (CANTM) designed for COVID-19 disinformation category classification and topic discovery; 3) an extensive analysis of COVID-19 disinformation categories with respect to time, volume, false type, media type and origin source.},

The analyses utilize large-scale network analysis tools, natural language processing techniques, and information theory to examine all the federal opinions in the Court Listener database, containing approximately 1.3 million judicial opinions and 11.4 million citations. The analyses are focused on modern United States Federal Case Law, as cases in the Court Listener database range from approximately 1926--2020 and include most Federal jurisdictions. We examine the data set from a structural perspective using the citation network, overall and by time and space (jurisdiction). In addition to citation structure, we examine the dataset from a topical and information theoretic perspective, again, overall and by time and space.},

When topic modelling met deep neural networks, there emerged a new and increasingly popular research area, neural topic models, with nearly a hundred models developed and a wide range of applications in neural language understanding such as text generation, summarisation and language models. There is a need to summarise research developments and discuss open problems and future directions. In this paper, we provide a focused yet comprehensive overview of neural topic models for interested researchers in the AI community, so as to facilitate them to navigate and innovate in this fast-growing research area. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first review on this specific topic.},

	abstract = {We present analyses from a real-time information monitoring system of online local news in the U.S. We study relationships among online local news coverage of COVID, cases and deaths in an area, and properties of local news outlets and their audiences. Our analysis relies on a unique dataset of the online content of over 300 local news outlets, encompassing over 750,000 articles over a period of 10 months spanning April 2020 to February 2021. We find that the rate of COVID coverage over time by local news outlets was primarily associated with death rates at the national level, but that this effect dissipated over the course of the pandemic as news about COVID was steadily displaced by sociopolitical events, like the 2020 U.S. elections. We also find that both the volume and content of COVID coverage differed depending on local politics, and outlet audience size, as well as evidence that more vulnerable populations received less pandemic-related news.},

@article{pittaras_2021_text_classification_with_semantically_enriched_word_embeddings,
	abstract = {Abstract
            The recent breakthroughs in deep neural architectures across multiple machine learning fields have led to the widespread use of deep neural models. These learners are often applied as black-box models that ignore or insufficiently utilize a wealth of preexisting semantic information. In this study, we focus on the text classification task, investigating methods for augmenting the input to deep neural networks (DNNs) with semantic information. We extract semantics for the words in the preprocessed text from the WordNet semantic graph, in the form of weighted concept terms that form a semantic frequency vector. Concepts are selected via a variety of semantic disambiguation techniques, including a basic, a part-of-speech-based, and a semantic embedding projection method. Additionally, we consider a weight propagation mechanism that exploits semantic relationships in the concept graph and conveys a spreading activation component. We enrich word2vec embeddings with the resulting semantic vector through concatenation or replacement and apply the semantically augmented word embeddings on the classification task via a DNN. Experimental results over established datasets demonstrate that our approach of semantic augmentation in the input space boosts classification performance significantly, with concatenation offering the best performance. We also note additional interesting findings produced by our approach regarding the behavior of term frequency - inverse document frequency normalization on semantic vectors, along with the radical dimensionality reduction potential with negligible performance loss.},

@inproceedings{zhu_2018_enhanced_aspect_level_sentiment_classification_with_auxiliary_memory,
	abstract = {In aspect level sentiment classification, there are two common tasks: to identify the sentiment of an aspect (category) or a term. As specific instances of aspects, terms explicitly occur in sentences. It is beneficial for models to focus on nearby context words. In contrast, as high level semantic concepts of terms, aspects usually have more generalizable representations. However, conventional methods cannot utilize the information of aspects and terms at the same time, because few datasets are annotated with both aspects and terms. In this paper, we propose a novel deep memory network with auxiliary memory to address this problem. In our model, a main memory is used to capture the important context words for sentiment classification. In addition, we build an auxiliary memory to implicitly convert aspects and terms to each other, and feed both of them to the main memory. With the interaction between two memories, the features of aspects and terms can be learnt simultaneously. We compare our model with the state-of-the-art methods on four datasets from different domains. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.},

@article{sridhar_2022_heterogeneous_supervised_topic_models,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Researchers in the social sciences are often interested in the relationship between text and an outcome of interest, where the goal is to both uncover latent patterns in the text and predict outcomes for unseen texts. To this end, this paper develops the heterogeneous supervised topic model (HSTM), a probabilistic approach to text analysis and prediction. HSTMs posit a joint model of text and outcomes to find heterogeneous patterns that help with both text analysis and prediction. The main benefit of HSTMs is that they capture heterogeneity in the relationship between text and the outcome across latent topics. To fit HSTMs, we develop a variational inference algorithm based on the auto-encoding variational Bayes framework. We study the performance of HSTMs on eight datasets and find that they consistently outperform related methods, including fine-tuned black-box models. Finally, we apply HSTMs to analyze news articles labeled with pro- or anti-tone. We find evidence of differing language used to signal a pro- and anti-tone.},

First we compare the acceptability ratings of sentences judged in isolation, with a relevant context, and with an irrelevant context. Our results show that context induces a cognitive load for humans, which compresses the distribution of ratings. Moreover, in relevant contexts we observe a discourse coherence effect that uniformly raises acceptability. Next, we test unidirectional and bidirectional language models in their ability to predict acceptability ratings. The bidirectional models show very promising results, with the best model achieving a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised acceptability prediction. The two sets of experiments provide insights into the cognitive aspects of sentence processing and central issues in the computational modeling of text and discourse.},

@article{liu_2019_semantic_features_based_n_best_rescoring_methods_for_automatic_speech_recognition,
	abstract = {In this work, we aim to re-rank the n-best hypotheses of an automatic speech recognition system by punishing the sentences which have words that are semantically different from the context and rewarding the sentences where all words are in semantical harmony. To achieve this, we proposed a topic similarity score that measures the difference between topic distribution of words and the corresponding sentence. We also proposed another word-discourse score that quantifies the likeliness for a word to appear in the sentence by the inner production of word vector and discourse vector. Besides, we used the latent semantic marginal and a variation of log bi-linear model to get the sentence coordination score. In addition we introduce a fallibility weight, which assists the computation of the sentence semantically coordination score by instructing the model to pay more attention to the words that appear less in the hypotheses list and we show how to use the scores and the fallibility weight in hypotheses rescoring. None of the rescoring methods need extra parameters other than the semantic models. Experiments conducted on the Wall Street Journal corpus show that, by using the proposed word-discourse score on 50-dimension word embedding, we can achieve 0.29\% and 0.51\% absolute word error rate (WER) reductions on the two testsets.},

As an effective expression means of tourists' opinions, text mining of such data has big potential to inspire innovations for tourism practitioners. In the past decade, a variety of text mining techniques have been proposed and applied to tourism analysis to develop tourism value analysis models, build tourism recommendation systems, create tourist profiles, and make policies for supervising tourism markets. The successes of these techniques have been further boosted by the progress of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and deep learning. With the understanding of the complexity due to this diverse set of techniques and tourism text data sources, this work attempts to provide a detailed and up-to-date review of text mining techniques that have been, or have the potential to be, applied to modern tourism big data analysis. We summarize and discuss different text representation strategies, text-based NLP techniques for topic extraction, text classification, sentiment analysis, and text clustering in the context of tourism text mining, and their applications in tourist profiling, destination image analysis, market demand, etc. Our work also provides guidelines for constructing new tourism big data applications and outlines promising research areas in this field for incoming years.},

@article{wang_2021_hierarchical_concept_driven_language_model,
	abstract = {For guiding natural language generation, many semantic-driven methods have been proposed. While clearly improving the performance of the end-to-end training task, these existing semantic-driven methods still have clear limitations: for example, (i) they only utilize shallow semantic signals (e.g., from topic models) with only a single stochastic hidden layer in their data generation process, which suffer easily from noise (especially adapted for short-text etc.) and lack of interpretation; (ii) they ignore the sentence order and document context, as they treat each document as a bag of sentences, and fail to capture the long-distance dependencies and global semantic meaning of a document. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel semantic-driven language modeling framework, which is a method to learn a Hierarchical Language Model and a Recurrent Conceptualization-enhanced Gamma Belief Network, simultaneously. For scalable inference, we develop the auto-encoding Variational Recurrent Inference, allowing efficient end-to-end training and simultaneously capturing global semantics from a text corpus. Especially, this article introduces concept information derived from high-quality lexical knowledge graph Probase, which leverages strong interpretability and anti-nose capability for the proposed model. Moreover, the proposed model captures not only intra-sentence word dependencies, but also temporal transitions between sentences and inter-sentence concept dependence. Experiments conducted on several NLP tasks validate the superiority of the proposed approach, which could effectively infer meaningful hierarchical concept structure of document and hierarchical multi-scale structures of sequences, even compared with latest state-of-the-art Transformer-based models.},

@article{zandie_2022_topical_language_generation_using_transformers,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Large-scale transformer-based language models (LMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in open-text generation. However, controlling the generated text's properties such as the topic, style, and sentiment is challenging and often requires significant changes to the model architecture or retraining and fine-tuning the model on new supervised data. This paper presents a novel approach for topical language generation (TLG) by combining a pre-trained LM with topic modeling information. We cast the problem using Bayesian probability formulation with topic probabilities as a prior, LM probabilities as the likelihood, and TLG probability as the posterior. In learning the model, we derive the topic probability distribution from the user-provided document's natural structure. Furthermore, we extend our model by introducing new parameters and functions to influence the quantity of the topical features presented in the generated text. This feature would allow us to easily control the topical properties of the generated text. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art results on coherency, diversity, and fluency while being faster in decoding.},

Screen content is used for disambiguation of utterances that refer to screen objects and for enabling the user to act upon screen objects using voice commands. We propose a deep learning architecture that jointly models the user utterance and the screen and incorporates detailed screen content features. Our model is trained to optimize end to end semantic accuracy across contextual and non-contextual functionality, therefore learns the desired behavior directly from the data. We show that this approach outperforms a rule-based alternative, and can be extended in a straightforward manner to new contextual use cases. We perform detailed evaluation of contextual and non-contextual use cases and show that our system displays accurate contextual behavior without degrading the performance of non-contextual user requests.},

@article{song_2019_hierarchical_context_enabled_recurrent_neural_network_for_recommendation,
	abstract = {A long user history inevitably reflects the transitions of personal interests over time. The analyses on the user history require the robust sequential model to anticipate the transitions and the decays of user interests. The user history is often modeled by various RNN structures, but the RNN structures in the recommendation system still suffer from the long-term dependency and the interest drifts. To resolve these challenges, we suggest HCRNN with three hierarchical contexts of the global, the local, and the temporary interests. This structure is designed to withhold the global long-term interest of users, to reflect the local sub-sequence interests, and to attend the temporary interests of each transition. Besides, we propose a hierarchical context-based gate structure to incorporate our interest drift assumption. As we suggest a new RNN structure, we support HCRNN with a complementary bi-channel attention structure to utilize hierarchical context. We experimented the suggested structure on the sequential recommendation tasks with CiteULike, MovieLens, and LastFM, and our model showed the best performances in the sequential recommendations.},

@article{jin_2022_topic_attention_encoder_a_self_supervised_approach_for_short_text_clustering,
	abstract = {Short text clustering is a challenging and important task in many practical applications. However, many Bag-of-Word--based methods for short text clustering are often limited by the sparsity of text representation, while many sentence embedding--based methods fail to capture the document structure dependencies within a text corpus. In considerations of the shortcomings of many existing studies, a topic attention encoder (TAE) is proposed in this study. Given topics derived from corpus by the techniques of topic modelling, the cross-document information is introduced. This encoder assumes the document-topic vector to be the learning target and the concatenating vectors of the word embedding and corresponding topic-word vector to be the input. Also, a self-attention mechanism is employed in the encoder, which aims to extract weights of hidden states adaptively and encode the semantics of each short text document. With captured global dependencies and local semantics, TAE integrates the superiority of Bag-of-Word methods and sentence embedding methods. Finally, categories of benchmarking experiments were conducted by analysing three public data sets. It demonstrates that the proposed TAE outperforms many document representation benchmark methods for short text clustering.},

@article{guo_2022_recurrent_coupled_topic_modeling_over_sequential_documents,
	abstract = {The abundant sequential documents such as online archival, social media, and news feeds are streamingly updated, where each chunk of documents is incorporated with smoothly evolving yet dependent topics. Such digital texts have attracted extensive research on dynamic topic modeling to infer hidden evolving topics and their temporal dependencies. However, most of the existing approaches focus on single-topic-thread evolution and ignore the fact that a current topic may be coupled with multiple relevant prior topics. In addition, these approaches also incur the intractable inference problem when inferring latent parameters, resulting in a high computational cost and performance degradation. In this work, we assume that a current topic evolves from all prior topics with corresponding coupling weights, forming the
              multi-topic-thread evolution
              . Our method models the dependencies between evolving topics and thoroughly encodes their complex multi-couplings across time steps. To conquer the intractable inference challenge, a new solution with a set of novel data augmentation techniques is proposed, which successfully discomposes the multi-couplings between evolving topics. A fully conjugate model is thus obtained to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency of the inference technique. A novel Gibbs sampler with a backward--forward filter algorithm efficiently learns latent time-evolving parameters in a closed-form. In addition, the latent Indian Buffet Process compound distribution is exploited to automatically infer the overall topic number and customize the sparse topic proportions for each sequential document without bias. The proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets against the competitive baselines, demonstrating its superiority over the baselines in terms of the low per-word perplexity, high coherent topics, and better document time prediction.},

@article{yasunaga_2019_topiceq_a_joint_topic_and_mathematical_equation_model_for_scientific_texts,
	abstract = {Scientific documents rely on both mathematics and text to communicate ideas. Inspired by the topical correspondence between mathematical equations and word contexts observed in scientific texts, we propose a novel topic model that jointly generates mathematical equations and their surrounding text (TopicEq). Using an extension of the correlated topic model, the context is generated from a mixture of latent topics, and the equation is generated by an RNN that depends on the latent topic activations. To experiment with this model, we create a corpus of 400K equation-context pairs extracted from a range of scientific articles from arXiv, and fit the model using a variational autoencoder approach. Experimental results show that this joint model significantly outperforms existing topic models and equation models for scientific texts. Moreover, we qualitatively show that the model effectively captures the relationship between topics and mathematics, enabling novel applications such as topic-aware equation generation, equation topic inference, and topic-aware alignment of mathematical symbols and words.},

Recently, there are several researches on hierarchical neural topic models since the relationships among topics are valuable for data analysis and exploration. However, the existing hierarchical neural topic models are limited to generate a single topic tree. In this study, we present a nonparametric forest-structured neural topic model by firstly applying the self-attention mechanism to capture parent-child topic relationships, and then build a sparse directed acyclic graph to form a topic forest. Experiments indicate that our model can automatically learn a forest-structured topic hierarchy with indefinite numbers of trees and leaves, and significantly outperforms the baseline models on topic hierarchical rationality and affinity.},

@article{oppenlaender_2022_crowdsourcing_creative_work,
	abstract = {This article-based doctoral thesis explores the stakeholder perspectives and experiences of crowdsourced creative work on two of the leading crowdsourcing platforms. The thesis has two parts. In the first part, we explore creative work from the perspective of the crowd worker. In the second part, we explore and study the requester's perspective in different contexts and several case studies. The research is exploratory and we contribute empirical insights using survey-based and artefact-based approaches common in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In the former approach, we explore the key issues that may limit creative work on paid crowdsourcing platforms. In the latter approach, we create computational artefacts to elicit authentic experiences from both crowd workers and requesters of crowdsourced creative work. The thesis contributes a classification of crowd workers into five archetypal profiles, based on the crowd workers' demographics, disposition, and preferences for creative work. We propose a three-part classification of creative work on crowdsourcing platforms: creative tasks, creativity tests, and creativity judgements (also referred to as creative feedback). The thesis further investigates the emerging research topic of how requesters can be supported in interpreting and evaluating complex creative work. Last, we discuss the design implications for research and practice and contribute a vision of creative work on future crowdsourcing platforms with the aim of empowering crowd workers and fostering an ecosystem around tailored platforms for creative microwork. Keywords: creative work, creativity, creativity support tools, crowdsourcing},

	abstract = {Anticipating price developments in financial markets is a topic of continued interest in forecasting. Funneled by advancements in deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) together with the availability of vast amounts of textual data in form of news articles, social media postings, etc., an increasing number of studies incorporate text-based predictors in forecasting models. We contribute to this literature by introducing weak learning, a recently proposed NLP approach to address the problem that text data is unlabeled. Without a dependent variable, it is not possible to finetune pretrained NLP models on a custom corpus. We confirm that finetuning using weak labels enhances the predictive value of text-based features and raises forecast accuracy in the context of predicting cryptocurrency returns. More fundamentally, the modeling paradigm we present, weak labeling domain-specific text and finetuning pretrained NLP models, is universally applicable in (financial) forecasting and unlocks new ways to leverage text data.},

@article{rosati_2022_moving_beyond_word_lists_towards_abstractive_topic_labels_for_human_like_topics_of_scientific_documents,
	abstract = {Topic models represent groups of documents as a list of words (the topic labels). This work asks whether an alternative approach to topic labeling can be developed that is closer to a natural language description of a topic than a word list. To this end, we present an approach to generating human-like topic labels using abstractive multi-document summarization (MDS). We investigate our approach with an exploratory case study. We model topics in citation sentences in order to understand what further research needs to be done to fully operationalize MDS for topic labeling. Our case study shows that in addition to more human-like topics there are additional advantages to evaluation by using clustering and summarization measures instead of topic model measures. However, we find that there are several developments needed before we can design a well-powered study to evaluate MDS for topic modeling fully. Namely, improving cluster cohesion, improving the factuality and faithfulness of MDS, and increasing the number of documents that might be supported by MDS. We present a number of ideas on how these can be tackled and conclude with some thoughts on how topic modeling can also be used to improve MDS in general.},

It is beneficial in multiple tasks including medical diagnose health and care department, targeted marketing, entertainment industry, and group filtering processes. A recent innovation in both data mining and natural language processing gained the attention of researchers from all over the world to develop automated systems for text classification. NLP allows categorizing documents containing different texts. A huge amount of data is generated on social media sites through social media users. Three datasets have been used for experimental purposes including the COVID-19 fake news dataset, COVID-19 English tweet dataset, and extremist-non-extremist dataset which contain news blogs, posts, and tweets related to coronavirus and hate speech. Transfer learning approaches do not experiment on COVID-19 fake news and extremist-non-extremist datasets. Therefore, the proposed work applied transfer learning classification models on both these datasets to check the performance of transfer learning models. Models are trained and evaluated on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Heat maps are also generated for every model. In the end, future directions are proposed.},

@article{ji_2022_achieving_reliable_human_assessment_of_open_domain_dialogue_systems,
	abstract = {Evaluation of open-domain dialogue systems is highly challenging and development of better techniques is highlighted time and again as desperately needed. Despite substantial efforts to carry out reliable live evaluation of systems in recent competitions, annotations have been abandoned and reported as too unreliable to yield sensible results. This is a serious problem since automatic metrics are not known to provide a good indication of what may or may not be a high-quality conversation. Answering the distress call of competitions that have emphasized the urgent need for better evaluation techniques in dialogue, we present the successful development of human evaluation that is highly reliable while still remaining feasible and low cost. Self-replication experiments reveal almost perfectly repeatable results with a correlation of \$r=0.969\$. Furthermore, due to the lack of appropriate methods of statistical significance testing, the likelihood of potential improvements to systems occurring due to chance is rarely taken into account in dialogue evaluation, and the evaluation we propose facilitates application of standard tests. Since we have developed a highly reliable evaluation method, new insights into system performance can be revealed. We therefore include a comparison of state-of-the-art models (i) with and without personas, to measure the contribution of personas to conversation quality, as well as (ii) prescribed versus freely chosen topics. Interestingly with respect to personas, results indicate that personas do not positively contribute to conversation quality as expected.},

Most topic models require the additional step of attaching meaningful labels to estimated topics, a process that is not scalable, suffers from human bias, and is difficult to replicate. We present a transfer topic labeling method that seeks to remedy these problems, using domain-specific codebooks as the knowledge base to automatically label estimated topics. We demonstrate our approach with a large-scale topic model analysis of the complete corpus of UK House of Commons speeches from 1935 to 2014, using the coding instructions of the Comparative Agendas Project to label topics. We evaluated our results using human expert coding and compared our approach with more current state-of-the-art neural methods. Our approach was simple to implement, compared favorably to expert judgments, and outperformed the neural networks model for a majority of the topics we estimated.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Entities play an essential role in understanding textual documents, regardless of whether the documents are short, such as tweets, or long, such as news articles. In short textual documents, all entities mentioned are usually considered equally important because of the limited amount of information. In long textual documents, however, not all entities are equally important: some are salient and others are not. Traditional entity topic models (ETMs) focus on ways to incorporate entity information into topic models to better explain the generative process of documents. However, entities are usually treated equally, without considering whether they are salient or not. In this work, we propose a novel ETM, Salient Entity Topic Model, to take salient entities into consideration in the document generation process. In particular, we model salient entities as a source of topics used to generate words in documents, in addition to the topic distribution of documents used in traditional topic models. Qualitative and quantitative analysis is performed on the proposed model. Application to entity salience detection demonstrates the effectiveness of our model compared to the state-of-the-art topic model baselines.},

	abstract = {Most models of information diffusion online rely on the assumption that pieces of information spread independently from each other. However, several works pointed out the necessity of investigating the role of interactions in real-world processes, and highlighted possible difficulties in doing so: interactions are sparse and brief. As an answer, recent advances developed models to account for interactions in underlying publication dynamics. In this article, we propose to extend and apply one such model to determine whether interactions between news headlines on Reddit play a significant role in their underlying publication mechanisms. After conducting an in-depth case study on 100,000 news headline from 2019, we retrieve state-of-the-art conclusions about interactions and conclude that they play a minor role in this dataset.},

@article{kashyap_2022_so_different_yet_so_alike_constrained_unsupervised_text_style_transfer,
	abstract = {Automatic transfer of text between domains has become popular in recent times. One of its aims is to preserve the semantic content of text being translated from source to target domain. However, it does not explicitly maintain other attributes between the source and translated text, for e.g., text length and descriptiveness. Maintaining constraints in transfer has several downstream applications, including data augmentation and de-biasing. We introduce a method for such constrained unsupervised text style transfer by introducing two complementary losses to the generative adversarial network (GAN) family of models. Unlike the competing losses used in GANs, we introduce cooperative losses where the discriminator and the generator cooperate and reduce the same loss. The first is a contrastive loss and the second is a classification loss, aiming to regularize the latent space further and bring similar sentences across domains closer together. We demonstrate that such training retains lexical, syntactic, and domain-specific constraints between domains for multiple benchmark datasets, including ones where more than one attribute change. We show that the complementary cooperative losses improve text quality, according to both automated and human evaluation measures.},

@article{gou_2022_pretrained_language_encoders_are_natural_tagging_frameworks_for_aspect_sentiment_triplet_extraction,
	abstract = {Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) aims to extract the spans of aspect, opinion, and their sentiment relations as sentiment triplets. Existing works usually formulate the span detection as a 1D token tagging problem, and model the sentiment recognition with a 2D tagging matrix of token pairs. Moreover, by leveraging the token representation of Pretrained Language Encoders (PLEs) like BERT, they can achieve better performance. However, they simply leverage PLEs as feature extractors to build their modules but never have a deep look at what specific knowledge does PLEs contain. In this paper, we argue that instead of further designing modules to capture the inductive bias of ASTE, PLEs themselves contain "enough" features for 1D and 2D tagging: (1) The token representation contains the contextualized meaning of token itself, so this level feature carries necessary information for 1D tagging. (2) The attention matrix of different PLE layers can further capture multi-level linguistic knowledge existing in token pairs, which benefits 2D tagging. (3) Furthermore, with simple transformations, these two features can also be easily converted to the 2D tagging matrix and 1D tagging sequence, respectively. That will further boost the tagging results. By doing so, PLEs can be natural tagging frameworks and achieve a new state of the art, which is verified by extensive experiments and deep analyses.},

@article{li_2022_improving_word_translation_via_two_stage_contrastive_learning,
	abstract = {Word translation or bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) is a key cross-lingual task, aiming to bridge the lexical gap between different languages. In this work, we propose a robust and effective two-stage contrastive learning framework for the BLI task. At Stage C1, we propose to refine standard cross-lingual linear maps between static word embeddings (WEs) via a contrastive learning objective; we also show how to integrate it into the self-learning procedure for even more refined cross-lingual maps. In Stage C2, we conduct BLI-oriented contrastive fine-tuning of mBERT, unlocking its word translation capability. We also show that static WEs induced from the `C2-tuned' mBERT complement static WEs from Stage C1. Comprehensive experiments on standard BLI datasets for diverse languages and different experimental setups demonstrate substantial gains achieved by our framework. While the BLI method from Stage C1 already yields substantial gains over all state-of-the-art BLI methods in our comparison, even stronger improvements are met with the full two-stage framework: e.g., we report gains for 112/112 BLI setups, spanning 28 language pairs.},

@article{yang_2022_rethink_about_the_word_level_quality_estimation_for_machine_translation_from_human_judgement,
	abstract = {Word-level Quality Estimation (QE) of Machine Translation (MT) aims to find out potential translation errors in the translated sentence without reference. Typically, conventional works on word-level QE are designed to predict the translation quality in terms of the post-editing effort, where the word labels ("OK" and "BAD") are automatically generated by comparing words between MT sentences and the post-edited sentences through a Translation Error Rate (TER) toolkit. While the post-editing effort can be used to measure the translation quality to some extent, we find it usually conflicts with the human judgement on whether the word is well or poorly translated. To overcome the limitation, we first create a golden benchmark dataset, namely {\textbackslash}emph\{HJQE\} (Human Judgement on Quality Estimation), where the expert translators directly annotate the poorly translated words on their judgements. Additionally, to further make use of the parallel corpus, we propose the self-supervised pre-training with two tag correcting strategies, namely tag refinement strategy and tree-based annotation strategy, to make the TER-based artificial QE corpus closer to {\textbackslash}emph\{HJQE\}. We conduct substantial experiments based on the publicly available WMT En-De and En-Zh corpora. The results not only show our proposed dataset is more consistent with human judgment but also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed tag correcting strategies.{\textbackslash}footnote\{The data can be found at {\textbackslash}url\{https://github.com/ZhenYangIACAS/HJQE\}.\}},

@article{pham_2022_pic_a_phrase_in_context_dataset_for_phrase_understanding_and_semantic_search,
	abstract = {Since BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), learning contextualized word embeddings has been a de-facto standard in NLP. However, the progress of learning contextualized phrase embeddings is hindered by the lack of a human-annotated, phrase-in-context benchmark. To fill this gap, we propose PiC - a dataset of {\textasciitilde}28K of noun phrases accompanied by their contextual Wikipedia pages and a suite of three tasks of increasing difficulty for evaluating the quality of phrase embeddings. We find that training on our dataset improves ranking models' accuracy and remarkably pushes Question Answering (QA) models to near-human accuracy which is 95\% Exact Match (EM) on semantic search given a query phrase and a passage. Interestingly, we find evidence that such impressive performance is because the QA models learn to better capture the common meaning of a phrase regardless of its actual context. That is, on our Phrase Sense Disambiguation (PSD) task, SotA model accuracy drops substantially (60\% EM), failing to differentiate between two different senses of the same phrase under two different contexts. Further results on our 3-task PiC benchmark reveal that learning contextualized phrase embeddings remains an interesting, open challenge.},

@article{huang_2022_can_language_models_be_specific_how,
	abstract = {A good speaker not only needs to be correct, but also has the ability to be specific when desired, and so are language models. In this paper, we propose to measure how specific the language of pre-trained language models (PLMs) is. To achieve this, we introduce a novel approach to build a benchmark for specificity testing by forming masked token prediction tasks with prompts. For instance, given ``J. K. Rowling was born in [MASK].'', we want to test whether a more specific answer will be better filled in by PLMs, e.g., Yate instead of England. From our evaluations, we show that existing PLMs have only a slight preference for more specific answers. We identify underlying factors affecting the specificity and design two prompt-based methods to improve the specificity. Results show that the specificity of the models can be improved by the proposed methods without additional training. We believe this work can provide new insights for language modeling and encourage the research community to further explore this important but understudied problem.},

@article{yang_2022_knowledge_injected_prompt_based_fine_tuning_for_multi_label_few_shot_icd_coding,
	abstract = {Automatic International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple ICD codes to a medical note with average length of 3,000+ tokens. This task is challenging due to a high-dimensional space of multi-label assignment (tens of thousands of ICD codes) and the long-tail challenge: only a few codes (common diseases) are frequently assigned while most codes (rare diseases) are infrequently assigned. This study addresses the long-tail challenge by adapting a prompt-based fine-tuning technique with label semantics, which has been shown to be effective under few-shot setting. To further enhance the performance in medical domain, we propose a knowledge-enhanced longformer by injecting three domain-specific knowledge: hierarchy, synonym, and abbreviation with additional pretraining using contrastive learning. Experiments on MIMIC-III-full, a benchmark dataset of code assignment, show that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art method in 14.5\% in marco F1 (from 10.3 to 11.8, P\&lt;0.001). To further test our model on few-shot setting, we created a new rare diseases coding dataset, MIMIC-III-rare50, on which our model improves marco F1 from 17.1 to 30.4 and micro F1 from 17.2 to 32.6 compared to previous method.},

	abstract = {Training keyphrase generation (KPG) models requires a large amount of annotated data, which can be prohibitively expensive and often limited to specific domains. In this study, we first demonstrate that large distribution shifts among different domains severely hinder the transferability of KPG models. We then propose a three-stage pipeline, which gradually guides KPG models' learning focus from general syntactical features to domain-related semantics, in a data-efficient manner. With Domain-general Phrase pre-training, we pre-train Sequence-to-Sequence models with generic phrase annotations that are widely available on the web, which enables the models to generate phrases in a wide range of domains. The resulting model is then applied in the Transfer Labeling stage to produce domain-specific pseudo keyphrases, which help adapt models to a new domain. Finally, we fine-tune the model with limited data with true labels to fully adapt it to the target domain. Our experiment results show that the proposed process can produce good quality keyphrases in new domains and achieve consistent improvements after adaptation with limited in-domain annotated data.},

@article{yang_2019_connecting_documents_words_and_languages_using_topic_models,
	abstract = {Topic models discover latent topics in documents and summarize documents at a high level. To improve topic models' topic quality and extrinsic performance, external knowledge is often incorporated as part of the generative story. One form of external knowledge is weighted text links that indicate similarity or relatedness between the connected objects. This dissertation 1) uncovers the latent structures in observed weighted links and integrates them into topic modeling, and 2) learns latent weighted links from other external knowledge to improve topic modeling. We consider incorporating links at three different levels: documents, words, and topics. We first look at binary document links, e.g., citation links of papers. Document links indicate topic similarity of the connected documents. Past methods model the document links separately, ignoring the entire link density. We instead uncover latent document blocks in which documents are densely connected and tend to talk about similar topics. We introduce LBH-RTM, a relational topic model with lexical weights, block priors, and hinge loss. It extracts informative topic priors from the document blocks for documents' topic generation. It predicts unseen document links with block and lexical features and hinge loss, in addition to topical features. It outperforms past methods in link prediction and gives more coherent topics. Like document links, words are also linked, but usually with real-valued weights. Word links are known as word associations and indicate the semantic relatedness of the connected words. They provide more information about word relationships in addition to the co-occurrence patterns in the training corpora. To extract and incorporate the knowledge in word associations, we introduce methods to find the most salient word pairs. The methods organize the words in a tree structure, which serves as a prior (i.e., tree prior) for tree LDA. The methods are straightforward but effective, yielding more coherent topics than vanilla LDA, and slightly improving the extrinsic classification performance. Weighted topic links are different. Topics are latent, so it is difficult to obtain ground-truth topic links, but learned weighted topic links could bridge the topics across languages. We introduce a multilingual topic model (MTM) that assumes each language has its own topic distributions over the words only in that language and learns weighted topic links based on word translations and words' topic distributions. It does not force the topic spaces of different languages to be aligned and is more robust than previous MTMs that do. It outperforms past MTMs in classification while still giving coherent topics on less comparable and smaller corpora.},

	abstract = {Active research pertaining to the affective phenomenon of empathy and distress is invaluable for improving human-machine interaction. Predicting intensities of such complex emotions from textual data is difficult, as these constructs are deeply rooted in the psychological theory. Consequently, for better prediction, it becomes imperative to take into account ancillary factors such as the psychological test scores, demographic features, underlying latent primitive emotions, along with the text{'}s undertone and its psychological complexity. This paper proffers team PVG{'}s solution to the WASSA 2021 Shared Task on Predicting Empathy and Emotion in Reaction to News Stories. Leveraging the textual data, demographic features, psychological test score, and the intrinsic interdependencies of primitive emotions and empathy, we propose a multi-input, multi-task framework for the task of empathy score prediction. Here, the empathy score prediction is considered the primary task, while emotion and empathy classification are considered secondary auxiliary tasks. For the distress score prediction task, the system is further boosted by the addition of lexical features. Our submission ranked 1st based on the average correlation (0.545) as well as the distress correlation (0.574), and 2nd for the empathy Pearson correlation (0.517).},

Recognizing PCL is challenging because of its subtle nature, because available datasets are limited in size, and because this task often relies on some form of commonsense knowledge. In this paper, we study to what extent PCL detection models can be improved by pre-training them on other, more established NLP tasks. We find that performance gains are indeed possible in this way, in particular when pre-training on tasks focusing on sentiment, harmful language and commonsense morality. In contrast, for tasks focusing on political speech and social justice, no or only very small improvements were witnessed. These findings improve our understanding of the nature of PCL.},

@article{lahnala_2022_mitigating_toxic_degeneration_with_empathetic_data_exploring_the_relationship_between_toxicity_and_empathy,
	abstract = {Large pre-trained neural language models have supported the effectiveness of many NLP tasks, yet are still prone to generating toxic language hindering the safety of their use. Using empathetic data, we improve over recent work on controllable text generation that aims to reduce the toxicity of generated text. We find we are able to dramatically reduce the size of fine-tuning data to 7.5-30k samples while at the same time making significant improvements over state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation of up to 3.4\% absolute reduction (26\% relative) from the original work on 2.3m samples, by strategically sampling data based on empathy scores. We observe that the degree of improvement is subject to specific communication components of empathy. In particular, the cognitive components of empathy significantly beat the original dataset in almost all experiments, while emotional empathy was tied to less improvement and even underperforming random samples of the original data. This is a particularly implicative insight for NLP work concerning empathy as until recently the research and resources built for it have exclusively considered empathy as an emotional concept.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted everyone's life across the world. In this work, we characterize the subjective wellbeing patterns of 112 cities across the United States during the pandemic prior to vaccine availability, as exhibited in subreddits corresponding to the cities. We quantify subjective wellbeing using positive and negative affect. We then measure the pandemic's impact by comparing a community's observed wellbeing with its expected wellbeing, as forecasted by time series models derived from prior to the pandemic.We show that general community traits reflected in language can be predictive of community resilience. We predict how the pandemic would impact the wellbeing of each community based on linguistic and interaction features from normal times {\textbackslash}textit\{before\} the pandemic. We find that communities with interaction characteristics corresponding to more closely connected users and higher engagement were less likely to be significantly impacted. Notably, we find that communities that talked more about social ties normally experienced in-person, such as friends, family, and affiliations, were actually more likely to be impacted. Additionally, we use the same features to also predict how quickly each community would recover after the initial onset of the pandemic. We similarly find that communities that talked more about family, affiliations, and identifying as part of a group had a slower recovery.},

	abstract = {It is known that social support and empathy are beneficial for mental health. As a result of the widespread development of social media, online social support and empathy could also influence user behaviors during the development of online communities. However, few studies have examined these effects from the perspective of online mental health communities. These communities appear to be a crucial source for mental health related support, but the spread of online empathy in these communities is not well-understood. This study focused on 22 mental health related subreddits, and matched and compared users (1) who received social support with those who did not receive social support, and users (2) who received more empathic social support with those who received less empathic social support. The results showed that social support and empathy are ``contagious''. That is, users who received social support at their first post would be more likely to post again and provide support for others; in addition, users who received more empathic support would subsequently express a higher level of empathy to others in the future. Our findings indicate the potential chain reaction of social support and empathy in online mental health communities. Our study also provides insights into how online mental health communities might better assist people to deliver social support that can help others to deal with mental problems.},

@article{hedayatnia_2022_a_systematic_evaluation_of_response_selection_for_open_domain_dialogue,
	abstract = {Recent progress on neural approaches for language processing has triggered a resurgence of interest on building intelligent open-domain chatbots. However, even the state-of-the-art neural chatbots cannot produce satisfying responses for every turn in a dialog. A practical solution is to generate multiple response candidates for the same context, and then perform response ranking/selection to determine which candidate is the best. Previous work in response selection typically trains response rankers using synthetic data that is formed from existing dialogs by using a ground truth response as the single appropriate response and constructing inappropriate responses via random selection or using adversarial methods. In this work, we curated a dataset where responses from multiple response generators produced for the same dialog context are manually annotated as appropriate (positive) and inappropriate (negative). We argue that such training data better matches the actual use case examples, enabling the models to learn to rank responses effectively. With this new dataset, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for response selection, and demonstrate that both strategies of using multiple positive candidates and using manually verified hard negative candidates can bring in significant performance improvement in comparison to using the adversarial training data, e.g., increase of 3\% and 13\% in Recall@1 score, respectively.},

We believe these issues hinder research progress and argue that current directions will benefit from a clear conceptualization that includes operationalizing cognitive empathy components. Our main objectives are to provide insight and guidance on empathy conceptualization for NLP research objectives and to encourage researchers to pursue the overlooked opportunities in this area, highly relevant, e.g., for clinical and educational sectors.},

Social media such as Facebook are one of many technology mediators used by the people in the world to share information. This information can be in many forms, such as personal information, selling information, obituary information and etc. Obituary information is shared by the people on Facebook and responded to by other people with various responses. This study is descriptive research to find the strategy used by people in the Indonesian context while responding to the obituary updated on Facebook. The subjects are lecturer's wife, artist, and an abortion girl. This study has described the responses from Facebook users as the strategy in responding to the obituary. The finding of this study showed that the condolence strategy used always depends on the person who dies itself. The person who is seen as the good person will have a good response, while someone who is seen as a bad person, in this case, the girl who did an abortion, has a positive and negative response.},

@article{tsoumou_2022_impoliteness_on_facebook_during_the_covid_19_pandemic,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Digital discourse has emerged as a substantial focus of interest within the pragmatic field. Specifically, (im)politeness practices on social media have increasingly received scholarly attention in the last decade (Tagg, Caroline, Philip Seargeant \& Amy Aisha Brown. 2017. Taking offence on social media. Conviviality and conviviality and communication on Facebook. Switzerland: Springer Nature, Palgrave McMillan; Tsoumou, Jean Mathieu. 2020. Analyzing speech acts in politically related Facebook communication. Journal of Pragmatics 167. 80--97). However, research combining COVID-19, Facebook and (im)politeness in a politically polarizing context is still scarce. This paper is an analysis of (im)politeness in Facebook comments posted as reactions to Giuliani's COVID diagnosis. Thus, by combining quantitative and qualitative approaches, the aim of the present paper is twofold: On the one hand, it intends to further our understanding of the manifestation of (im)politeness practices on Facebook through an analysis of reactive comments to Giuliani's Covid-19 diagnosis on BBC news Facebook page. On the other hand, the paper aims to examine how the struggle between impoliteness and politeness divides Facebook users between sympathizers and detractors of the patient. Through a metadiscursive analysis, the identified (im)politeness items are distributed in an uneven fashion, with impoliteness-oriented items prevailing as the dominant macro category against politeness-oriented ones. The findings suggest that users employ different strategies to express or intensify (im)politeness, favoring explicit expressions of impoliteness such as redress/agreement, insults, pointed criticisms/complaints, unpalatable questions and/or presuppositions over others like threats.},

@article{lee_2022_topic_taxonomy_expansion_via_hierarchy_aware_topic_phrase_generation,
	abstract = {Topic taxonomies display hierarchical topic structures of a text corpus and provide topical knowledge to enhance various NLP applications. To dynamically incorporate new topic information, several recent studies have tried to expand (or complete) a topic taxonomy by inserting emerging topics identified in a set of new documents. However, existing methods focus only on frequent terms in documents and the local topic-subtopic relations in a taxonomy, which leads to limited topic term coverage and fails to model the global topic hierarchy. In this work, we propose a novel framework for topic taxonomy expansion, named TopicExpan, which directly generates topic-related terms belonging to new topics. Specifically, TopicExpan leverages the hierarchical relation structure surrounding a new topic and the textual content of an input document for topic term generation. This approach encourages newly-inserted topics to further cover important but less frequent terms as well as to keep their relation consistency within the taxonomy. Experimental results on two real-world text corpora show that TopicExpan significantly outperforms other baseline methods in terms of the quality of output taxonomies.},

              odeling (dhCM) for social media stream. Instead of manually dividing the timeframe, a multimodal event miner exploits a density estimation technique to continuously capture the temporal influence between documents and incrementally identify online events in textual, temporal, and spatial spaces. At the same time, an adaptive categorization hierarchy is formed to automatically organize the documents into proper categories at multiple levels of granularities. In a nonparametric manner, dhCM accommodates the increasing complexity of data streams with automatically growing the categorization hierarchy over adaptive growth. A sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is used for the online inference of the dhCM parameters. Extensive experiments show that dhCM outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of term coherence, category abstraction and specialization, hierarchical affinity, and event categorization and discovery accuracy.},

@article{taha_2022_detecting_implicit_cross_communities_to_which_an_active_user_belongs,
	abstract = {Most realistic social communities are
              multi-profiled cross-communities
              constructed from users sharing commonalities that include adaptive social profile ingredients (i.e., natural adaptation to certain social traits). The most important types of such cross-communities are the
              densest
              holonic ones, because they exhibit many interesting properties. For example, such a cross-community can represent a portion of users, who share
              all
              the following traits: ethnicity, religion, neighbourhood, and age-range. The denser a multi-profiled cross-community is, the more granular and holonic it is and the greater the number of its members, whose interests are exhibited in the common interests of the entire cross-community. Moreover, the denser a cross-community is, the more specific and distinguishable its interests are (e.g., more distinguishable from other cross-communities). Unfortunately, methods that advocate the detection of granular multi-profiled cross-communities have been under-researched. Most current methods detect multi-profiled communities without consideration to their granularities. To overcome this, we introduce in this paper a novel methodology for detecting the smallest and most granular multi-profiled cross-community, to which an active user belongs. The methodology is implemented in a system called ID\_CC. To improve the accuracy of detecting such cross-communities, we first uncover missing links in social networks. It is imperative for uncovering such missing links because they may contain valuable information (social characteristics commonalities, cross-memberships, etc.). We evaluated ID\_CC by comparing it experimentally with eight methods. The results of the experiments revealed marked improvement.},

@article{xie_2021_a_domain_independent_ontology_learning_method_based_on_transfer_learning,
	abstract = {Ontology plays a critical role in knowledge engineering and knowledge graphs (KGs). However, building ontology is still a nontrivial task. Ontology learning aims at generating domain ontologies from various kinds of resources by natural language processing and machine learning techniques. One major challenge of ontology learning is reducing labeling work for new domains. This paper proposes an ontology learning method based on transfer learning, namely TF-Mnt, which aims at learning knowledge from new domains that have limited labeled data. This paper selects Web data as the learning source and defines various features, which utilizes abundant textual information and heterogeneous semi-structured information. Then, a new transfer learning model TF-Mnt is proposed, and the parameters' estimation is also addressed. Although there exist distribution differences of features between two domains, TF-Mnt can measure the relevance by calculating the correlation coefficient. Moreover, TF-Mnt can efficiently transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain and avoid negative transfer. Experiments in real-world datasets show that TF-Mnt achieves promising learning performance for new domains despite the small number of labels in it, by learning knowledge from a proper existing domain which can be automatically selected.},

@article{wang_2022_knowledge_aware_bayesian_deep_topic_model,
	abstract = {We propose a Bayesian generative model for incorporating prior domain knowledge into hierarchical topic modeling. Although embedded topic models (ETMs) and its variants have gained promising performance in text analysis, they mainly focus on mining word co-occurrence patterns, ignoring potentially easy-to-obtain prior topic hierarchies that could help enhance topic coherence. While several knowledge-based topic models have recently been proposed, they are either only applicable to shallow hierarchies or sensitive to the quality of the provided prior knowledge. To this end, we develop a novel deep ETM that jointly models the documents and the given prior knowledge by embedding the words and topics into the same space. Guided by the provided knowledge, the proposed model tends to discover topic hierarchies that are organized into interpretable taxonomies. Besides, with a technique for adapting a given graph, our extended version allows the provided prior topic structure to be finetuned to match the target corpus. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model efficiently integrates the prior knowledge and improves both hierarchical topic discovery and document representation.},

In this work, we study Seeded Hierarchical Clustering (SHC): the task of automatically fitting unlabeled data to such taxonomies using only a small set of labeled examples. We propose HierSeed, a novel weakly supervised algorithm for this task that uses only a small set of labeled seed examples. It is both data and computationally efficient. HierSeed assigns documents to topics by weighing document density against topic hierarchical structure. It outperforms both unsupervised and supervised baselines for the SHC task on three real-world datasets.},

@article{xu_2022_hyperminer_topic_taxonomy_mining_with_hyperbolic_embedding,
	abstract = {Embedded topic models are able to learn interpretable topics even with large and heavy-tailed vocabularies. However, they generally hold the Euclidean embedding space assumption, leading to a basic limitation in capturing hierarchical relations. To this end, we present a novel framework that introduces hyperbolic embeddings to represent words and topics. With the tree-likeness property of hyperbolic space, the underlying semantic hierarchy among words and topics can be better exploited to mine more interpretable topics. Furthermore, due to the superiority of hyperbolic geometry in representing hierarchical data, tree-structure knowledge can also be naturally injected to guide the learning of a topic hierarchy. Therefore, we further develop a regularization term based on the idea of contrastive learning to inject prior structural knowledge efficiently. Experiments on both topic taxonomy discovery and document representation demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves improved performance against existing embedded topic models.},

@article{zhou_2022_a_comprehensive_survey_on_deep_clustering_taxonomy_challenges_and_future_directions,
	abstract = {Clustering is a fundamental machine learning task which has been widely studied in the literature. Classic clustering methods follow the assumption that data are represented as features in a vectorized form through various representation learning techniques. As the data become increasingly complicated and complex, the shallow (traditional) clustering methods can no longer handle the high-dimensional data type. With the huge success of deep learning, especially the deep unsupervised learning, many representation learning techniques with deep architectures have been proposed in the past decade. Recently, the concept of Deep Clustering, i.e., jointly optimizing the representation learning and clustering, has been proposed and hence attracted growing attention in the community. Motivated by the tremendous success of deep learning in clustering, one of the most fundamental machine learning tasks, and the large number of recent advances in this direction, in this paper we conduct a comprehensive survey on deep clustering by proposing a new taxonomy of different state-of-the-art approaches. We summarize the essential components of deep clustering and categorize existing methods by the ways they design interactions between deep representation learning and clustering. Moreover, this survey also provides the popular benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics and open-source implementations to clearly illustrate various experimental settings. Last but not least, we discuss the practical applications of deep clustering and suggest challenging topics deserving further investigations as future directions.},

	abstract = {Topic models extract latent concepts from texts in the form of topics. Lifelong topic models extend topic models by learning topics continuously based on accumulated knowledge from the past which is updated continuously as new information becomes available. Hierarchical topic modeling extends topic modeling by extracting topics and organizing them into a hierarchical structure. In this study, we combine the two and introduce hierarchical lifelong topic models. Hierarchical lifelong topic models not only allow to examine the topics at different levels of granularity but also allows to continuously adjust the granularity of the topics as more information becomes available. A fundamental issue in hierarchical lifelong topic modeling is the extraction of rules that are used to preserve the hierarchical structural information among the rules and will continuously update based on new information. To address this issue, we introduce a network communities based rule mining approach for hierarchical lifelong topic models (NHLTM). The proposed approach extracts hierarchical structural information among the rules by representing textual documents as graphs and analyzing the underlying communities in the graph. Experimental results indicate improvement of the hierarchical topic structures in terms of topic coherence that increases from general to specific topics.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              The rapid growth of electronic health record (EHR) datasets opens up promising opportunities to understand human diseases in a systematic way. However, effective extraction of clinical knowledge from EHR data has been hindered by the sparse and noisy information. We present Graph ATtention-Embedded Topic Model (GAT-ETM), an end-to-end taxonomy-knowledge-graph-based multimodal embedded topic model. GAT-ETM distills latent disease topics from EHR data by learning the embedding from a constructed medical knowledge graph. We applied GAT-ETM to a large-scale EHR dataset consisting of over 1 million patients. We evaluated its performance based on topic quality, drug imputation, and disease diagnosis prediction. GAT-ETM demonstrated superior performance over the alternative methods on all tasks. Moreover, GAT-ETM learned clinically meaningful graph-informed embedding of the EHR codes and discovered interpretable and accurate patient representations for patient stratification and drug recommendations. GAT-ETM code is available at
              https://github.com/li-lab-mcgill/GAT-ETM

	abstract = {The discrete representation of resources in geospatial catalogues affects their information retrieval performance. The performance could be improved by using automatically generated clusters of related resources, which we name quasi-spatial dataset series. This work evaluates whether a clustering process can create quasi-spatial dataset series using only textual information from metadata elements. We assess the combination of different kinds of text cleaning approaches, word and sentence-embeddings representations (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, ELMo, Sentence BERT, and Universal Sentence Encoder), and clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN, OPTICS, and agglomerative clustering) for the task. The results demonstrate that combining word-embeddings representations with an agglomerative-based clustering creates better quasi-spatial dataset series than the other approaches. In addition, we have found that the ELMo representation with agglomerative clustering produces good results without any preprocessing step for text cleaning.},

@article{bonnici_2022_covid19it_the_digital_side_of_covid19_a_picture_from_italy_with_clustering_and_taxonomy,
	abstract = {The Covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted on our lives, triggering a strong reaction resulting in vaccines, more effective diagnoses and therapies, policies to contain the pandemic outbreak, to name but a few. A significant contribution to their success comes from the computer science and information technology communities, both in support to other disciplines and as the primary driver of solutions for, e.g., diagnostics, social distancing, and contact tracing. In this work, we surveyed the Italian computer science and engineering community initiatives against the Covid19 pandemic. The 128 responses thus collected document the response of such a community during the first pandemic wave in Italy (February-May 2020), through several initiatives carried out by both single researchers and research groups able to promptly react to Covid19, even remotely. The data obtained by the survey are here reported, discussed and further investigated by Natural Language Processing techniques, to generate semantic clusters based on embedding representations of the surveyed activity descriptions. The resulting clusters have been then used to extend an existing Covid19 taxonomy with the classification of related research activities in computer science and information technology areas, summarizing this work contribution through a reproducible survey-to-taxonomy methodology.},

@article{addanki_2021_how_to_design_robust_algorithms_using_noisy_comparison_oracle,
	abstract = {Metric based comparison operations such as finding maximum, nearest and farthest neighbor are fundamental to studying various clustering techniques such as
              k
              -center clustering and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. These techniques crucially rely on accurate estimation of pairwise distance between records. However, computing exact features of the records, and their pairwise distances is often challenging, and sometimes not possible. We circumvent this challenge by leveraging weak supervision in the form of a comparison oracle that compares the relative distance between the queried points such as `Is point
              u
              closer to
              v
              or
              w

              x
              ?'.
            
            
              However, it is possible that some queries are easier to answer than others using a comparison oracle. We capture this by introducing two different noise models called adversarial and probabilistic noise. In this paper, we study various problems that include finding maximum, nearest/farthest neighbor search under these noise models. Building upon the techniques we develop for these problems, we give robust algorithms for
              k
              -center clustering and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We prove that our algorithms achieve good approximation guarantees with a high probability and analyze their query complexity. We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques empirically on various real-world datasets.},

@article{sun_2021_computational_modeling_of_hierarchically_polarized_groups_by_structured_matrix_factorization,
	abstract = {The paper extends earlier work on modeling hierarchically polarized groups on social media. An algorithm is described that 1) detects points of
              agreement
              and
              disagreement
              between groups, and 2) divides them
              hierarchically
              to represent nested patterns of agreement and disagreement given a structural guide. For example, two opposing parties might disagree on core issues. Moreover, within a party, despite agreement on fundamentals, disagreement might occur on further details. We call such scenarios
              hierarchically polarized groups
              . An (enhanced) unsupervised Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm is described for computational modeling of hierarchically polarized groups. It is enhanced with a language model, and with a proof of orthogonality of factorized components. We evaluate it on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating ability to hierarchically decompose overlapping beliefs. In the case where polarization is flat, we compare it to prior art and show that it outperforms state of the art approaches for polarization detection and stance separation. An ablation study further illustrates the value of individual components, including new enhancements.},

@article{zhang_2021_using_full_text_content_of_academic_articles_to_build_a_methodology_taxonomy_of_information_science_in_china,
	abstract = {Research on the construction of traditional information science methodology taxonomy is mostly conducted manually. From the limited corpus, researchers have attempted to summarize some of the research methodology entities into several abstract levels (generally three levels); however, they have been unable to provide a more granular hierarchy. Moreover, updating the methodology taxonomy is traditionally a slow process. In this study, we collected full-text academic papers related to information science. First, we constructed a basic methodology taxonomy with three levels by manual annotation. Then, the word vectors of the research methodology entities were trained using the full-text data. Accordingly, the research methodology entities were clustered and the basic methodology taxonomy was expanded using the clustering results to obtain a methodology taxonomy with more levels. This study provides new concepts for constructing a methodology taxonomy of information science. The proposed methodology taxonomy is semi-automated; it is more detailed than conventional schemes and the speed of taxonomy renewal has been enhanced.},

Recent research has shown that nodes in a network can often be organized in latent hierarchical structures, but without a particular underlying taxonomy, the learned node embedding is less useful nor interpretable. In this work, we aim to improve network embedding by modeling the conditional node proximity in networks indicated by node labels residing in real taxonomies. In the meantime, we also aim to model the hierarchical label proximity in the given taxonomies, which is too coarse by solely looking at the hierarchical topologies.

@inproceedings{wood_2022_a_bayesian_topic_model_for_human_evaluated_interpretability,
	abstract = {One desiderata of topic modeling is to produce interpretable topics. Given a cluster of document-tokens comprising a topic, we can order the topic by counting each word. It is natural to think that each topic could easily be labeled by looking at the words with the highest word count. However, this is not always the case. A human evaluator can often have difficulty identifying a single label that accurately describes the topic as many top words seem unrelated. This paper aims to improve interpretability in topic modeling by providing a novel, outperforming interpretable topic model Our approach combines two previously established subdomains in topic modeling: nonparametric and weakly-supervised topic models. Given a nonparametric topic model, we can include weakly-supervised input using novel modifications to the nonparametric generative model. These modifications lay the groundwork for a compelling setting{---}one in which most corpora, without any previous supervised or weakly-supervised input, can discover interpretable topics. This setting also presents various challenging sub-problems of which we provide resolutions. Combining nonparametric topic models with weakly-supervised topic models leads to an exciting discovery{---}a complete, self-contained and outperforming topic model for interpretability.},

The network representation used by Community Topic results in a natural relationship between topics and a topic hierarchy. This allows sub- and super-topics to be found on demand.

Document categorization and information retrieval are two applications that may benefit from unsupervised learning (e.g., text clustering and topic modeling), including exploratory data analysis. However, the unsupervised learning paradigm poses reproducibility issues. The initialization can lead to variability depending on the machine learning algorithm. Furthermore, the distortions can be misleading when regarding cluster geometry. Amongst the causes, the presence of outliers and anomalies can be a determining factor. Despite the relevance of initialization and outlier issues for text clustering and topic modeling, the authors did not find an in-depth analysis of them. This survey provides a systematic literature review (2011-2022) of these subareas and proposes a common terminology since similar procedures have different terms. The authors describe research opportunities, trends, and open issues. The appendices summarize the theoretical background of the text vectorization, the factorization, and the clustering algorithms that are directly or indirectly related to the reviewed works.},

@article{wood_2022_knowledge_source_rankings_for_semi_supervised_topic_modeling,
	abstract = {Recent work suggests knowledge sources can be added into the topic modeling process to label topics and improve topic discovery. The knowledge sources typically consist of a collection of human-constructed articles, each describing a topic (article-topic) for an entire domain. However, these semisupervised topic models assume a corpus to contain topics on only a subset of a domain. Therefore, during inference, the model must consider which article-topics were theoretically used to generate the corpus. Since the knowledge sources tend to be quite large, the many article-topics considered slow down the inference process. The increase in execution time is significant, with knowledge source input greater than 103 becoming unfeasible for use in topic modeling. To increase the applicability of semisupervised topic models, approaches are needed to speed up the overall execution time. This paper presents a way of ranking knowledge source topics to satisfy the above goal. Our approach utilizes a knowledge source ranking, based on the PageRank algorithm, to determine the importance of an article-topic. By applying our ranking technique we can eliminate low scoring article-topics before inference, speeding up the overall process. Remarkably, this ranking technique can also improve perplexity and interpretability. Results show our approach to outperform baseline methods and significantly aid semisupervised topic models. In our evaluation, knowledge source rankings yield a 44\% increase in topic retrieval f-score, a 42.6\% increase in inter-inference topic elimination, a 64\% increase in perplexity, a 30\% increase in token assignment accuracy, a 20\% increase in topic composition interpretability, and a 5\% increase in document assignment interpretability over baseline methods.},

We extend upon these neural topic models by introducing the Label-Indexed Neural Topic Model (LI-NTM), which is, to the extent of our knowledge, the first effective upstream semi-supervised neural topic model. We find that LI-NTM outperforms existing neural topic models in document reconstruction benchmarks, with the most notable results in low labeled data regimes and for data-sets with informative labels; furthermore, our jointly learned classifier outperforms baseline classifiers in ablation studies.},

@article{lu_2022_event_centric_question_answering_via_contrastive_learning_and_invertible_event_transformation,
	abstract = {Human reading comprehension often requires reasoning of event semantic relations in narratives, represented by Event-centric Question-Answering (QA). To address event-centric QA, we propose a novel QA model with contrastive learning and invertible event transformation, call TranCLR. Our proposed model utilizes an invertible transformation matrix to project semantic vectors of events into a common event embedding space, trained with contrastive learning, and thus naturally inject event semantic knowledge into mainstream QA pipelines. The transformation matrix is fine-tuned with the annotated event relation types between events that occurred in questions and those in answers, using event-aware question vectors. Experimental results on the Event Semantic Relation Reasoning (ESTER) dataset show significant improvements in both generative and extractive settings compared to the existing strong baselines, achieving over 8.4\% gain in the token-level F1 score and 3.0\% gain in Exact Match (EM) score under the multi-answer setting. Qualitative analysis reveals the high quality of the generated answers by TranCLR, demonstrating the feasibility of injecting event knowledge into QA model learning. Our code and models can be found at https://github.com/LuJunru/TranCLR.},

BERT-based language models have been used successfully in applications that require a deep understanding of the language, such as sentiment analysis. This paper investigates the use of disentangled learning to improve BERT-based textual representations in ABSA tasks. Motivated by the success of disentangled representation learning in the field of computer vision, which aims to obtain explanatory factors of the data representations, we explored the recent DeBERTa model (Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention) to disentangle the syntactic and semantics features from a BERT architecture. Experimental results show that incorporating disentangled attention and a simple fine-tuning strategy for downstream tasks outperforms state-of-the-art models in ABSA's benchmark datasets.},

To make the best decisions, urban planners need to analyse relevant data and community responses, spread through abundant reports. This process can be labour intensive and might lead to overlooking less prominent but still relevant concerns of minorities. In this study, we present a Natural Language Processing framework to assist the analysis of consultation reports. The framework leverages state-of-the-art techniques that enable the urban planners to easily describe the issues of interest in free text and, as a result, to accurately identify the emerging concerns from different stakeholders. A first assessment of the London Plan's Green Belt policy has shown the capability of detecting specific community interests about urban planner problems, allowing quick identification of minorities' issues, otherwise overlooked due to the vast amount of data.},

Based on the approach proposed by Nguyen et al. in 2020, we derive a novel consensus value named ConTrip that merges their consensus score and the overall rating of a platform for an item. ConTrip lies in the rating range values, which makes it more interpretable while maintaining the ability to differentiate across equally rated experiences.

To conduct scene marketing for e-commerce platforms, this work presents a novel product form, scene-based topic channel which typically consists of a list of diverse products belonging to the same usage scenario and a topic title that describes the scenario with marketing words. As manual construction of channels is time-consuming due to billions of products as well as dynamic and diverse customers' interests, it is necessary to leverage AI techniques to automatically construct channels for certain usage scenarios and even discover novel topics. To be specific, we first frame the channel construction task as a two-step problem, i.e., scene-based topic generation and product clustering, and propose an E-commerce Scene-based Topic Channel construction system (i.e., ESTC) to achieve automated production, consisting of scene-based topic generation model for the e-commerce domain, product clustering on the basis of topic similarity, as well as quality control based on automatic model filtering and human screening. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B test validates the effectiveness of such a novel product form as well as the proposed system. In addition, we also introduce the experience of deploying the proposed system on a real-world e-commerce recommendation platform.},

For this reason, in this paper, we describe the related tasks, and we survey recent works that apply machine learning (ML) techniques for reducing the costs related to CIDOC-CRM-based compliance and interoperability. In particular, we (a) analyze the main processes and tasks, (b) identify tasks where the recent advances of ML (including Deep Learning) would be beneficial, (c) identify cases where ML has been applied (and the results are successful/promising) and (d) suggest tasks that can benefit from applying ML.

	abstract = {In supervised machine learning, specifically in classification tasks, selecting and analyzing the feature vector to achieve better results is one of the most important tasks. Traditional methods such as comparing the features' cosine similarity and exploring the datasets manually to check which feature vector is suitable is relatively time consuming. Many classification tasks failed to achieve better classification results because of poor feature vector selection and sparseness of data. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework, topic2features (T2F), to deal with short and sparse data using the topic distributions of hidden topics gathered from dataset and converting into feature vectors to build supervised classifier. For this we leveraged the unsupervised topic modelling LDA (latent dirichlet allocation) approach to retrieve the topic distributions employed in supervised learning algorithms. We made use of labelled data and topic distributions of hidden topics that were generated from that data. We explored how the representation based on topics affect the classification performance by applying supervised classification algorithms. Additionally, we did careful evaluation on two types of datasets and compared them with baseline approaches without topic distributions and other comparable methods. The results show that our framework performs significantly better in terms of classification performance compared to the baseline(without T2F) approaches and also yields improvement in terms of F1 score compared to other compared approaches.},

In this work, we present ECTSum, a new dataset with transcripts of earnings calls (ECTs), hosted by publicly traded companies, as documents, and short experts-written telegram-style bullet point summaries derived from corresponding Reuters articles. ECTs are long unstructured documents without any prescribed length limit or format.

@article{li_2022_interpretable_aspect_aware_capsule_network_for_peer_review_based_citation_count_prediction,
	abstract = {Citation count prediction is an important task for estimating the future impact of research papers. Most of the existing works utilize the information extracted from the paper itself. In this article, we focus on how to utilize another kind of useful data signal (i.e., peer review text) to improve both the performance and interpretability of the prediction models.
            Specially, we propose a novel aspect-aware capsule network for citation count prediction based on review text. It contains two major capsule layers, namely the feature capsule layer and the aspect capsule layer, with two different routing approaches, respectively. Feature capsules encode the local semantics from review sentences as the input of aspect capsule layer, whereas aspect capsules aim to capture high-level semantic features that will be served as final representations for prediction. Besides the predictive capacity, we also enhance the model interpretability with two strategies. First, we use the topic distribution of the review text to guide the learning of aspect capsules so that each aspect capsule can represent a specific aspect in the review. Then, we use the learned aspect capsules to generate readable text for explaining the predicted citation count. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model in both performance and interpretability.},

@article{alejandro_2020_towards_context_aware_opinion_summarization_for_monitoring_social_impact_of_news,
	abstract = {Opinion mining and summarization of the increasing user-generated content on different digital platforms (e.g., news platforms) are playing significant roles in the success of government programs and initiatives in digital governance, from extracting and analyzing citizen's sentiments for decision-making. Opinion mining provides the sentiment from contents, whereas summarization aims to condense the most relevant information. However, most of the reported opinion summarization methods are conceived to obtain generic summaries, and the context that originates the opinions (e.g., the news) has not usually been considered. In this paper, we present a context-aware opinion summarization model for monitoring the generated opinions from news. In this approach, the topic modeling and the news content are combined to determine the ``importance'' of opinionated sentences. The effectiveness of different developed settings of our model was evaluated through several experiments carried out over Spanish news and opinions collected from a real news platform. The obtained results show that our model can generate opinion summaries focused on essential aspects of the news, as well as cover the main topics in the opinionated texts well. The integration of term clustering, word embeddings, and the similarity-based sentence-to-news scoring turned out the more promising and effective setting of our model.},

Consumers also post reviews, suggestions, or judgments about goods or services on the website. The review data directly used by consumers provides positive feedback and nice impact to consumers, such as creating business value. Therefore, analysing review data is very important from a marketing point of view. Our research suggests a new way to find factors for customer satisfaction through review data. We applied a method to find factors for customer satisfaction by mixing and using the data mining technique, which is a big data analysis method, and the natural language processing technique, which is a language processing method, in our research. Unlike many studies on customer satisfaction that have been conducted in the past, our research has a novelty of the thesis by using various techniques. And as a result of the analysis, the results of our experiments were very accurate.},

@article{poumay_2021_htmot__hierarchical_topic_modelling_over_time,
	abstract = {Over the years, topic models have provided an efficient way of extracting insights from text. However, while many models have been proposed, none are able to model topic temporality and hierarchy jointly. Modelling time provide more precise topics by separating lexically close but temporally distinct topics while modelling hierarchy provides a more detailed view of the content of a document corpus. In this study, we therefore propose a novel method, HTMOT, to perform Hierarchical Topic Modelling Over Time. We train HTMOT using a new implementation of Gibbs sampling, which is more efficient. Specifically, we show that only applying time modelling to deep sub-topics provides a way to extract specific stories or events while high level topics extract larger themes in the corpus. Our results show that our training procedure is fast and can extract accurate high-level topics and temporally precise sub-topics. We measured our model's performance using the Word Intrusion task and outlined some limitations of this evaluation method, especially for hierarchical models. As a case study, we focused on the various developments in the space industry in 2020.},

	abstract = {The volume of discussions concerning brands within social media provides digital marketers with great opportunities for tracking and analyzing the feelings and views of consumers toward brands, products, influencers, services, and ad campaigns in CGC. The present study aims to assess and compare the performance of firms and celebrities (i.e., influencers that with the experience of being in an ad campaign of those companies) with the automated sentiment analysis that was employed for CGC at social media while exploring the feeling of the consumers toward them to observe which influencer (of two for each company) had a closer effect with the corresponding corporation on consumer minds. For this purpose, several consumer tweets from the pages of brands and influencers were utilized to make a comparison of machine learning and lexicon-based approaches to the sentiment analysis through the Naive algorithm (lexicon-based) and Naive Bayes algorithm (machine learning method) and obtain the desired results to assess the campaigns. The findings suggested that the approaches were dissimilar in terms of accuracy; the machine learning method yielded higher accuracy. Finally, the results showed which influencer was more appropriate according to their existence in previous campaigns and helped choose the right influencer in the future for our company and have a better, more appropriate, and more efficient ad campaign subsequently. It is required to conduct further studies on the accuracy improvement of the sentiment classification. This approach should be employed for other social media CGC types. The results revealed decision-making for which sentiment analysis methods are the best approaches for the analysis of social media. It was also found that companies should be aware of their consumers' sentiments and choose the right person every time they think of a campaign.},

@article{wang_2022_discovery_of_product_features_for_redesign_from_user_implicit_feedback,
	abstract = {Online reviews are key sources to help manufacturers design and improve their products. However, using online reviews for product redesign is challenging because many online reviews contain useless information, and customers rarely provide explicit information about the products. The few methods available to recognize the customers' demands from online reviews have several limitations, including failing to consider the redundancy of useless reviews, confusion in providing targeted information among different aspects of product design, and disregarding the manufacturing limitation. Hence, considering customer needs and manufacturing constraints for product improvement, this study proposes a new model called DPFR to discover the potential product features for redesign. In DPFR, it first analyzes and predicts helpfulness of reviews for more effective decision of product design and improvement, which is neglected in previous research. Then, a structured model based on topic modeling is conducted. Overlooked by previous researchers, DPFR also introduces a feature importance matric to measure the significance of each commented feature to product redesign. Third, a target features selection model is conducted further considering the limitations of manufacturers rather than only focusing on customer satisfaction. The effectiveness of the proposed model was assessed using a case study of data acquired from Bilibili, a large short-video platform in China. Focusing only on customer satisfaction, the results confirm the effectiveness of DPFR. Finally, including the constraints of product redesign, DPFR balances customer satisfaction and the manufacturing constraints such as redesign cost, redesign time, and carbon emissions. This study provides more practical suggestions for manufacturers to discover product redesign features that result in strategic product improvement decisions.},

	abstract = {Public feelings and reactions associated with finance are gaining significant importance as they help individuals, public health, financial and non-financial institutions, and the government understand mental health, the impact of policies, and counter-response. Every individual sentiment linked with a financial text can be categorized, whether it is a headline or the detailed content published in a newspaper. The Guardian newspaper is considered one of the most famous and the biggest websites for digital media on the internet. Moreover, it can be one of the vital platforms for tracking the public's mental health and feelings via sentimental analysis of news headlines and detailed content related to finance. One of the key purposes of this study is the public's mental health tracking via the sentimental analysis of financial text news primarily published on digital media to identify the overall mental health of the public and the impact of national or international financial policies. A dataset was collected using The Guardian application programming interface and processed using the support vector machine, AdaBoost, and single layer convolutional neural network. Among all identified techniques, the single layer convolutional neural network with a classification accuracy of 0.939 is considered the best during the training and testing phases as it produced efficient performance and effective results compared to other techniques, such as support vector machine and AdaBoost with associated classification accuracies 0.677 and 0.761, respectively. The findings of this research would also benefit public health, as well as financial and non-financial institutions.},

@article{kim_2022_opinion_mining_based_term_extraction_sentiment_classification_modeling,
	abstract = {The spread of social media has accelerated the formation and dissemination of user review data, which contain subjective opinions of users on products, in an e-commerce environment. Because these reviews significantly influence other users, opinion mining has garnered substantial attention in analyzing the positive and negative opinions of users and deriving solutions based on these analytical results. Terms that include sentimental information and used in user reviews serve as the most crucial element in sentimental classification. In this regard, it is crucial to distinguish the most influential terms in user reviews. This study proposed a document-level sentiment classification model based on the collection and application of user reviews generated in an e-commerce environment. Here, a term information extraction method was applied to the proposed model to select core terms, classify the selected terms according to parts of speech (POS), determine terms that can increase information power and influence, and adopt these terms in opinion mining research, based on SVM, SVM+, and SVM+MTL techniques. The results obtained from evaluating the proposed model indicate that it exhibited excellent sentiment analysis performance. The proposed model is expected to be effectively utilized in providing enhanced services for users and increasing competitiveness in the e-commerce environment.},

@article{firdaniza_2021_information_diffusion_model_in_twitter_a_systematic_literature_review,
	abstract = {Information diffusion, information spread, and influencers are important concepts in many studies on social media, especially Twitter analytics. However, literature overviews on the information diffusion of Twitter analytics are sparse, especially on the use of continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). This paper examines the following topics: (1) the purposes of studies about information diffusion on Twitter, (2) the methods adopted to model information diffusion on Twitter, (3) the metrics applied, and (4) measures used to determine influencer rankings. We employed a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore the studies related to information diffusion on Twitter extracted from four digital libraries. In this paper, a two-stage analysis was conducted. First, we implemented a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and R-bibliometrix software. This approach was applied to select 204 papers after conducting a duplication check and assessing the inclusion--exclusion criteria. At this stage, we mapped the authors' collaborative networks/collaborators and the evolution of research themes. Second, we analyzed the gap in research themes on the application of CTMC information diffusion on Twitter. Further filtering criteria were applied, and 34 papers were analyzed to identify the research objectives, methods, metrics, and measures used by each researcher. Nonhomogeneous CTMC has never been used in Twitter information diffusion modeling. This finding motivates us to further study nonhomogeneous CTMC as a modeling approach for Twitter information diffusion.},

@article{schlosser_2021_comparing_methods_to_collect_and_geolocate_tweets_in_great_britain,
	abstract = {In the era of Big Data, the Internet has become one of the main data sources: Data can be collected for relatively low costs and can be used for a wide range of purposes. To be able to timely support solid decisions in any field, it is essential to increase data production efficiency, data accuracy, and reliability. In this framework, our paper aims at identifying an optimized and flexible method to collect and, at the same time, geolocate social media information over a whole country. In particular, the target of this paper is to compare three alternative methods to collect data from the social media Twitter. This is achieved considering four main comparison criteria: Collection time, dataset size, pre-processing phase load, and geographic distribution. Our findings regarding Great Britain identify one of these methods as the best option, since it is able to collect both the highest number of tweets per hour and the highest percentage of unique tweets per hour. Furthermore, this method reduces the computational effort needed to pre-process the collected tweets (e.g., showing the lowest collection times and the lowest number of duplicates within the geographical areas) and enhances the territorial coverage (if compared to the population distribution). At the same time, the effort required to set up this method is feasible and less prone to the arbitrary decisions of the researcher.},

@article{ding_2021_exploring_sources_of_satisfaction_and_dissatisfaction_in_airbnb_accommodation_using_unsupervised_and_supervised_topic_modeling,
	abstract = {This study aims to examine key attributes affecting Airbnb users' satisfaction and dissatisfaction through the analysis of online reviews. A corpus that comprises 59,766 Airbnb reviews form 27,980 listings located in 12 different cities is analyzed by using both Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and supervised LDA (sLDA) approach. Unlike previous LDA based Airbnb studies, this study examines positive and negative Airbnb reviews separately, and results reveal the heterogeneity of satisfaction and dissatisfaction attributes in Airbnb accommodation. In particular, the emergence of the topic ``guest conflicts'' in this study leads to a new direction in future sharing economy accommodation research, which is to study the interactions of different guests in a highly shared environment. The results of topic distribution analysis show that in different types of Airbnb properties, Airbnb users attach different importance to the same service attributes. The topic correlation analysis reveals that home like experience and help from the host are associated with Airbnb users' revisit intention. We determine attributes that have the strongest predictive power to Airbnb users' satisfaction and dissatisfaction through the sLDA analysis, which provides valuable managerial insights into priority setting when developing strategies to increase Airbnb users' satisfaction. Methodologically, this study contributes by illustrating how to employ novel approaches to transform social media data into useful knowledge about customer satisfaction, and the findings can provide valuable managerial implications for Airbnb practitioners.},

The effectiveness of the method is validated by a large number of user reviews for smartphones wherein, with the evaluation indicator system, we can accurately predict the bad review rate for the product with only 9.9\% error. And improvement strategies are proposed after processing the whole approach in the case study. The approach can be applied for product evaluation and improvement, especially for the products with needs for iterative design and sailed online with plenty of user reviews.},

These analyses are helping brands to understand their customers' experiences as well as for maintaining a competitive advantage in the sector. Due to this fact, this study aims to analyze and characterize the public opinions from the messages posted by Twitter users while addressing customer services. For this purpose, this study carried out a content analysis of a customer service platform. We extracted the general users' viewpoints and sentiments of each of the discussed topics by using a wide range of techniques, such as topic modeling, document clustering, and opinion mining algorithms. For training these systems and drawing conclusions, a dataset containing tweets from the English-speaking customers addressing the @Uber\_Support platform during the year 2020 has been used.},

@article{bansal_2020_aspect_context_aware_sentiment_classification_of_online_consumer_reviews,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Aspect based sentiment classification is valuable for providing deeper insight into online consumer reviews (OCR). However, the majority of the previous studies explicitly determine the orientation of aspect related sentiment bearing word and overlook the aspect-context. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an aspect-context aware sentiment classification of OCR for deeper and more accurate insights.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              In the proposed methodology, first, aspect descriptions and sentiment bearing words are extracted. Then, the skip-gram model is used to extract the first set of features to capture contextual information. For the second category of features, cosine similarity is used between a pre-defined seed word list and aspects, to capture aspect context sensitive sentiments. The third set of features includes weighted word vectors using term frequency-inverse document frequency. After concatenating features, ensemble classifier is used using three base classifiers.
            
            
              Findings
              Experimental results on two real-world data sets with variable lengths, acquired from Amazon.com and TripAdvisor.com, show that the advised ensemble approach significantly outperforms sentiment classification accuracy of state-of-the-art and baseline methods.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This method is capable of capturing the correct sentiment of ambiguous words and other special words by extracting aspect-context using word vector similarity instead of expensive lexical resources, and hence, shows superior performance in terms of accuracy as compared to other methods.},

@article{he_2020_the_voice_of_drug_consumers_online_textual_review_analysis_using_structural_topic_model,
	abstract = {Many web-based pharmaceutical e-commerce platforms allow consumers to post open-ended textual reviews based on their purchase experiences. Understanding the true voice of consumers by analyzing such a large amount of user-generated content is of great significance to pharmaceutical manufacturers and e-commerce websites. The aim of this paper is to automatically extract hidden topics from web-based drug reviews using the structural topic model (STM) to examine consumers' concerns when they buy drugs online. The STM is a probabilistic extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which allows the consolidation of document-level covariates. This innovation allows us to capture consumer dissatisfaction along with their dynamics over time. We extract 12 topics, and five of them are negative topics representing consumer dissatisfaction, whose appearances in the negative reviews are substantially higher than those in the positive reviews. We also come to the conclusion that the prevalence of these five negative topics has not decreased over time. Furthermore, our results reveal that the prevalence of price-related topics has decreased significantly in positive reviews, which indicates that low-price strategies are becoming less attractive to customers. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first study using STM to analyze the unstructured textual data of drug reviews, which enhances the understanding of the aspects of drug consumer concerns and contributes to the research of pharmaceutical e-commerce literature.},

This study aimed to investigate the moderating effect of perceived risk on consumers' participation in the sharing economy in a developing country. Following a quantitative approach, a survey was conducted among 400 consumers in the Metropolitan Zone of Puebla City, Mexico. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the data. Economic benefits, enjoyment, and trust drove the usage behavior of consumers in the sharing economy. In addition, perceived risk significantly moderated the relationships that usage behavior has with the economic benefits and the feeling of the community. As predicted by social exchange theory, the consumers made choices based on a subjective cost--benefit analysis, showing flexibility in the type and amount of rewards. This study contributes to knowledge about customer behavior in the context of the sharing economy.},

              This study aims to explore how attribute performance and hosts' service quality attributes affect room sales on peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms from the cue congruence perspective.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              More than 9.53 million reviews concerning 258,473 listings located in 35 major cities worldwide were collected from Airbnb. Data was collected from December 2019 to December 2020 and was analysed using a generalised linear model.
            
            
              Findings
              Results show that when attribute performance and hosts' service quality attributes give positive signals, Airbnb room sales are significantly higher than when the two kinds of cues give inconsistent or negative signals; when attribute performance gives positive signals and hosts' service quality attributes give negative signals, room sales are higher than when the former gives negative signals and the latter give positive signals; surprisingly, when both kinds of cues give negative signals, room sales are higher than when attribute performance gives positive signals and hosts' service quality attributes give negative signals.

@article{casidy_2022_customer_brand_engagement_and_co_production_an_examination_of_key_boundary_conditions_in_the_sharing_economy,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Digital platforms have transformed how brands engage with collaborative consumption actors, such as prosumers. This study aims to examine the role of customer innovativeness and perceived economic value as important boundary conditions on the effects of customer brand engagement behavior on co-production, which subsequently influences customer satisfaction.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The authors test the model using survey data from 430 users of a digital platform (i.e. UBER) in Australia. Hypotheses were tested using the bias-corrected bootstrapping method.
            
            
              Findings
              The findings suggest that customer innovativeness and perceived economic value positively moderate the effects of customer brand engagement behavior on co-production. Further, the mediating effects of co-production on satisfaction are stronger for highly innovative customers and for those who associate high perceived economic value with the brand.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              This study provides novel insights on the boundary conditions of the effects of customer brand engagement behavior on co-production. Future research could apply this study's conceptual framework to other digital platforms to extend the generalizability of this framework.
            
            
              Practical implications
              This study provides managerial insights into how firms can customize marketing strategies to encourage customers as prosumers in co-production by targeting highly innovative customers and focusing on perceived economic value.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study builds on service-dominant logic and social exchange theory to examine the role of customer innovativeness and perceived economic value as novel boundary conditions in digital platform ecosystems.},

@article{ruan_2022_working_together_or_separately_the_role_of_different_review_arguments_in_consumers_home_sharing_service_purchasing_evidence_from_china,
	abstract = {Purpose
              This study aims to distinguish between service arguments and communication arguments within a home-sharing review and to investigate their roles in consumer purchase decision-making.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Based on the setting of Airbnb, a 3 (service argument valence: positive, neutral, and negative) × 3 (communication argument valence: positive, neutral, and negative) online experiment was conducted. Data collected from 379 participants were used to test the hypotheses.
            
            
              Findings
              The three main determinants of purchase intention: perceived host service quality, perceived facility service quality, and perceived social value, are affected by both service arguments and communication arguments. Service arguments positively influence perceived host service quality and perceived facility service quality, while communication arguments contribute significantly to perceived host service quality and perceived social value. However, perceived facility service quality is affected by the combination of service arguments and communication arguments rather than by the service arguments only, because service argument trustworthiness, a factor influencing the effect of service arguments, varies across the combination of two types of arguments.
            
            
              Practical implications
              This research helps home-sharing platform managers to understand how to facilitate transaction success through displaying different review arguments needed by consumers. Additionally, the dual role of communication arguments emphasizes a necessity for hosts to encourage positive communication arguments and provide additional cues on the facility service quality.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The service arguments and communication arguments in home-sharing reviews are distinguished, and their distinct roles in consumers' purchase intention have been uncovered.},

@article{manchanda_2022_multi_homing_in_b2b_services_a_psychological_perspective,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Extant literature on business-to-business (B2B) has largely ignored studying multi-homing through a psychological lens. This paper aims to outline the results of three constituent studies, which were designed to reveal potential differences in multi-homers' versus single-homers' loyalty behaviors in a B2B and supply chain management (SCM) setting; identify factors that differentiate single-homers and multi-homers in these settings; and examine the relevance and effect of perceived risk on multi-homing behaviors.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              In Studies 1 and 2, the authors used a questionnaire-based survey to capture the perceptions of 503 and 458 SCM experts, respectively. They then deployed AMOS v.21 to perform structural equation modeling. In Study 3, the authors used a mixed-methods approach to interview 18 SCM experts and then applied these insights to a survey with 242 SCM experts.
            
            
              Findings
              Study 1 reveals that multi-homers' loyalty toward their preferred SP has a weaker effect on willingness to pay premium prices and share-of-wallet than single-homers' loyalty. Study 2 establishes that several attitudinal factors distinguish multi-homers from single-homers in a loyalty framework. Study 3 concludes that perceived risk dimensions promote multi-homing intention, which in turn promotes multi-homing behavior.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Through empirical investigation, the present research succeeds in establishing that multi-homing is a concern for SPs, deciphering the attitudinal factors that distinguish multi-homers and single-homers in a loyalty framework, and confirming the influence of perceived risk dimensions on multi-homing. Thus, the study has several theoretical and practical implications for B2B services in emerging economies.},

@article{lee_2022_what_have_hosts_overlooked_for_improving_stay_experience_in_accommodation_sharing_empirical_evidence_from_airbnb_customer_reviews,
	abstract = {Purpose
              In accommodation-sharing, hosts must provide satisfactory stay experiences for guests, who will then express intentions to revisit (behavioral loyalty) and/or recommend the experiences to others (attitudinal loyalty) in their reviews. Through the lens of expectation-confirmation theory, this study aims to investigate the service dimensions customers focus on in their reviews and their relationships with customer-loyalty manifestations in accommodation-sharing.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study uses topic modeling to discover distinctive dimensions from Airbnb reviews from a micro perspective and map them onto overarching themes from a macro perspective, and further examine the relationships among topics using cluster analysis.
            
            
              Findings
              This study reveals ``information'' as an important theme rarely mentioned in the literature. Besides, ``homeliness'' is a unique dimension associated with behavioral and attitudinal loyalty toward accommodation-sharing.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The findings help accommodation-sharing platforms and hosts identify customer concerns and the drivers of customer loyalty in accommodation-sharing.

              In the existing literature, customer perceptions and loyalty are largely determined through surveys, and the findings are not univocal due to the inconsistencies of measurement items used, the potential response bias and limited sample sizes. This study capitalizes on the wealth of user-generated content and extracts service dimensions and customer loyalty directly from textual reviews, overcoming previous research limitations.},

@article{abutaleb_2022_towards_a_consumer_social_behavior_theory_for_sharing_economy_an_integrated_view,
	abstract = {Purpose
              The current study is exploring factors affecting social and sharing behavioral intentions. The paper proposes a new theory, the consumer social behavior theory, which aids in understanding social behaviors. This is through the convergence of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and norm activation theory (NAT) to foster the understanding of sharing and social behaviors. Religiosity, as a cultural and psychological factor, along with five major predictors of sharing practices are also incorporated. These predictors are economic benefits, sustainability, enjoyment, trust and difficulties in sharing practices.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The current study takes a new route through proposing a new theoretical contribution and developing a new theory termed consumer social behavior theory (CSBT) to be commonly used in social behavioral contexts.
            
            
              Findings
              The CSBT is an output of integrating two prominent theories in pro-social and pro-environmental contexts. It is found that integrating both theories help in thoroughly examining behavioral intentions. Religiosity is found to significantly impact intentions towards social behaviors, yet no study examined its role in sharing and social behaviors contexts.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study is contributing to and enriching the sharing economy research domain through new theoretical developments. A theory adaptation for TPB and NAT was conducted to advance a thorough understanding of sharing and social behavioral intentions. This work is considered the first of its kind to develop an integrated view for sharing and social behaviors.},

@article{zhuo_2022_consumer_demand_behavior_mining_and_product_recommendation_based_on_online_product_review_mining_and_fuzzy_sets,
	abstract = {Consumer demand is the need for product characteristics expressed in their own words, which is the basis for producers to develop product recommendations. The extraction and analysis of consumer demands is the most critical input information in quality function deployment (QFD), which has a significant impact on the final prioritization of product technical features, product optimization, and subsequent configuration decisions in QFD, and is directly related to the success of product development. However, the traditional QFD approach to demand analysis lacks reliability and feasibility, and its application often requires time and labor costs that exceed the company's actual capabilities. Therefore, this paper uses online reviews as the data source and constructs a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model based on fuzzy sets to explore the consumer demand information reflected in user reviews. We also introduce the concept of word vector to improve the LDA topic model and compare it with the traditional topic model to verify the performance of the model, so as to explore the consumer demand behavior more accurately and efficiently.},

@article{ahmed_2021_passenger_satisfaction_and_loyalty_for_app_based_ride_sharing_services_through_the_tunnel_of_perceived_quality_and_value_for_money,
	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this study is to investigate the passengers' perception of app or application-based ride-sharing service in Bangladesh. The research directly measures the passengers' perception of perceived quality and value for money of using app-based ride-sharing services in Bangladesh and how it impacts passengers' satisfaction. The study also measures the indirect relationship of perceived quality and value for money and passengers' loyalty through the mediating effects of passenger satisfaction in app-based ride-sharing services.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The authors used an online self-administered survey questionnaire to collect data from the respondents who have experienced app-based ride-sharing services in Bangladesh. In this study, 400 questionnaires were distributed to the respondents online (Google form) and received 281 useful responses that give a 70.25\% response rate. The survey data were analyzed based on construct validity, convergent validity and structural equation modeling by using Smart PLS 3.
            
            
              Findings
              The research findings indicate that perceived quality and value for money positively and significantly influence passengers' satisfaction. The passengers' satisfaction has a direct and significant relationship with passenger loyalty. The research findings also indicate that perceived quality and value for money have an indirect relationship with passenger loyalty through the mediating effect of passenger loyalty in app-based ride-sharing services.
            
            
              Practical implications
              Both perceived quality and value for money have been the key drivers of passenger satisfaction and loyalty. Thus, the ride-sharing service providers should emphasize enhancing passenger value perception and quality service to reinforce passenger satisfaction and loyalty by increasing communication with the passengers about their apps. Besides, the service providers need to keep track of passengers' satisfaction levels and adopt necessary initiatives to ensure satisfied passengers toward loyalty.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Limited studies have investigated the impacts of perceived quality and value for money on passenger satisfaction and loyalty to app-based rideshare service. It is a suitable time as the research findings will help ride-sharing service providers enhance their quality performance to compete healthily. Simultaneously, passengers can enjoy improved, and value-added services due to increasing competition among the app-based service providers. Regulators can also emphasize passenger quality services and the importance of money as a proposition while formulating policy and regulations toward the management of ride-sharing companies.},

@article{chung_2021_understanding_host_marketing_strategies_on_airbnb_and_their_impact_on_listing_performance_a_text_analytics_approach,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Peer-to-peer (P2P) accommodation sharing has become a significant part of the travel and lodging industry, allowing homeowners to engage in entrepreneurial activity via sharing of resources. However, there is limited understanding of how hosts can use listing descriptions to better match their offerings to different consumer segments. The purpose of this paper is to understand the use of listing descriptions by Airbnb hosts and the impact of such descriptions on sales performance.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              In this paper, a deep learning-based sentence-level aspect mining approach is used to extract various aspects from host-provided listing descriptions. Then a regression-based approach is used to understand the impact of various aspects of listing descriptions on listing performance.
            
            
              Findings
              It was found that aspects for which listing descriptions are the sole source of information have the greatest influence on listing performance. The authors also find that the impact of an aspect on listing performance varies by listing type, and that there is a mismatch between the most included aspects by hosts in their listing descriptions and the most influential aspects that impact sales.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The impact of consumer reviews in the context of Airbnb has been extensively studied. A novel aspect of this study is the exploration of P2P accommodations from a supplier perspective, by understanding the use and impact of host-provided textual descriptions on sales. The findings of this study can help better market properties from a practice perspective and better understand consumer information consumption from a theoretical perspective. The authors also demonstrate a new approach for exploring social phenomena by performing quantitative analysis on textual data using deep-learning and regression-based techniques.},

Using a text mining process and qualitative content analysis of 549 comments posted to a LinkedIn online discussion board, we identified six key themes; three were tied to camera and microphone issues, two involved eating and meeting management issues, and one dealt with work-from-home issues. These themes are discussed in relationship to media naturalness theory and meeting science. Because widespread use of videoconferencing will likely continue, we provide guidance for workplace policies/practices and suggest directions for future research.},

@article{shamim_2021_multi_attribute_online_decision_making_driven_by_opinion_mining,
	abstract = {With the evolution of data mining systems, the acquisition of timely insights from unstructured text is an organizational demand which is gradually increasing. The existing opinion mining systems have a variety of properties, such as the ranking of products' features and feature level visualizations; however, organizations require decision-making based upon customer feedback. Therefore, an opinion mining system is proposed in this work that ranks reviews and features based on novel ranking schemes with innovative opinion-strength-based feature-level visualization, which are tightly coupled to empower users to spot imperative product features and their ranking from enormous reviews. Enhancements are made at different phases of the opinion mining pipeline, such as innovative ways to evaluate review quality, rank product features and visualize opinion-strength-based feature-level summary. The target user groups of the proposed system are business analysts and customers who want to explore customer comments to gauge business strategies and purchase decisions. Finally, the proposed system is evaluated on a real dataset, and a usability study is conducted for the proposed visualization. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of review and feature ranking can improve the decision-making process.},

Results of this research were as follows: (1) The results analyzing the sub-dimension of benefits (Reasonable cost, Wearing at right time, place and occasion (TPO), Space Saving, Entertaining, Product Variety, Style Conformity) and perceived risks (Financial, Performance, Social) clearly presented factorial structures. (2) Reasonable cost, Style Conformity, and Product Variety showed significantly positive influences on usage intentions towards online fashion rental services; in addition, Financial, Performance, and Social risks of rental services had a negative effect on usage intentions. (3) Service trust and consumer perceptions of Financial and Performance risks had important mediating roles in the relationship between consumer benefits and usage intentions towards Online FRS. This study highlighted that consumer benefits, perceived risks, and service trust should be registered among consumers to boost usage intentions towards Online FRS.},

@article{papagiannidis_2021_bringing_smart_home_technology_to_peer_to_peer_accommodation_exploring_the_drivers_of_intention_to_stay_in_smart_accommodation,
	abstract = {Abstract
            COVID-19 has caused disruptions in the sharing economy for both platforms and owners, who are typically micro-businesses. Lower demand and ample supply means that users have a great deal of choice. Finding ways for properties to differentiate themselves has been a pressing need. Against this background, this paper pursued two objectives: firstly to explore the perceived functional and emotional value of smart accommodation and the factors contributing to this by adopting the Theory of Consumption Values, and secondly to examine the role of perceived value in driving intention to stay in smart accommodation in the future. 430 responses were collected to analyse the relationships among antecedents, value and intention. The results showed that the functional value of smart accommodation is associated with the perception that such accommodation represents good value for the price, smart devices are useful, they can enhance control of stay experiences, and there are resources and opportunities facilitating the use of technology. Emotional value is determined by the perception that staying in smart accommodation represents sustainable behaviour, the integration of smart home technologies offers control over the stay experience, improves the entertainment experience, aesthetics and playfulness of using technology. Emotional values are inhibited by the perception of surveillance in smart accommodation. Also, the study offers evidence of the correlation of intention with functional and emotional value. The evidence contributes to the literature by explaining the potential implications of innovative technologies for business recovery in the post-pandemic reality, exploring the applications of smart technologies in delivering tourism services, and identifying the factors in the adoption of smart homes in the hospitality sector. The findings provide practical implications for facilitating the applications of innovative technology and its adoption in home and non-home environments.},

@article{chowdhury_2022_a_decision_model_for_efficient_service_design_in_the_sharing_economy_a_service_triad_perspective,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Sharing economy-based service platforms are a relatively new way of delivering services that have received increasing attention from both practitioners and researchers. However, current research in the area is still developing in terms of offering practical insight in conjunction with a decision model that may help to determine optimal strategies for efficient service design in the sharing economy from a service triad perspective. Exploring this gap in the literature, this paper aims to develop and apply a decision model that enables managers to identify and prioritise the efficiency attributes of sharing economy-based services. It also aids in designing optimal strategies to enhance efficiency over time based on the insights obtained from users (buyers and sellers) and platform providers.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study adopts a mixed-methods approach. The qualitative approach comprised an extensive literature review followed by in-depth interviews, and the quantitative approach adopted the quality function deployment (QFD) integrated optimisation technique to design and prioritise the most optimal strategy emanating from the application of a decision model.
            
            
              Findings
              The findings revealed that establishing global distribution, continued technological research and development (R\&D) and enhancing the transactional platform are the most important strategies in the context of sharing economy platform providers (e.g. accommodation-based-platform service providers). This study also revealed that as the importance weights of the efficiency attributes changed over time, so too did the portfolio of strategies used to attain an optimal efficiency level.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The decision model brings a richer conceptual understanding of the dynamic changes over time that occur in the business ecosystem. It also allows managers of sharing economy-based platforms to select optimal strategies and make astute decisions towards achieving efficient service design.},

@article{zhang_2021_competitive_product_identification_and_sales_forecast_based_on_consumer_reviews,
	abstract = {Sellers readily obtain consumer product evaluations from online reviews in order to identify competitive products in detail and predict sales. Firstly, we collect product review data from shopping websites, social media, product communities, and other online platforms to identify product competitors with the help of word-frequency cooccurrence technology. We take mobile phones as an example to mine and analyze product competition information. Then, we calculate the product review quantity, review emotion value, product-network heat, and price statistics and establish the regression model of online product review forecasts. In addition, the neural-network model is established to suggest that the relationships among factors are linear. On the basis of analyzing and discussing the impact of product sales of the competitors, product price, the emotional value of the reviews, and product-network popularity, we construct the sales forecast model. Finally, to verify the validity of the factor analysis affecting the sales and the rationality of the established model, actual sales data are used to further analyze and verify the model, showing that the model is reasonable and effective.},

@article{zloteanu_2021_judgments_in_the_sharing_economy_the_effect_of_user_generated_trust_and_reputation_information_on_decision_making_accuracy_and_bias,
	abstract = {The growing ecosystem of peer-to-peer enterprise -- the Sharing Economy (SE) -- has brought with it a substantial change in how we access and provide goods and services. Within the SE, individuals make decisions based mainly on user-generated trust and reputation information (TRI). Recent research indicates that the use of such information tends to produce a positivity bias in the perceived trustworthiness of fellow users. Across two experimental studies performed on an artificial SE accommodation platform, we test whether users' judgments can be accurate when presented with diagnostic information relating to the quality of the profiles they see or if these overly positive perceptions persist. In study 1, we find that users are quite accurate overall (70\%) at determining the quality of a profile, both when presented with full profiles or with profiles where they selected three TRI elements they considered useful for their decision-making. However, users tended to exhibit an ``upward quality bias'' when making errors. In study 2, we leveraged patterns of frequently vs. infrequently selected TRI elements to understand whether users have insights into which are more diagnostic and find that presenting frequently selected TRI elements improved users' accuracy. Overall, our studies demonstrate that -- positivity bias notwithstanding -- users can be remarkably accurate in their online SE judgments.},

@article{lian_2022_a_normalized_rich_club_connectivity_based_strategy_for_keyword_selection_in_social_media_analysis,
	abstract = {In this paper, we present a study on keyword selection behavior in social media analysis that is focused on particular topics, and propose a new effective strategy that considers the co-occurrence relationships between keywords and uses graph-based techniques. In particular, we used the normalized rich-club connectivity considering the weighted degree, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and PageRank values to measure a subgroup of highly connected ``rich keywords'' in a keyword co-occurrence network. Community detection is subsequently applied to identify several keyword combinations that are able to accurately and comprehensively represent the researched topic. The empirical results based on four topics and comparing four existing models confirm the performance of our proposed strategy in promoting the quantity and ensuing the quality of data related to particular topics collected from social media. Overall, our findings are expected to offer useful guidelines on how to select keywords for social media-based studies and thus further increase the reliability and validity of their respective conclusions.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected the airline industry, as it has many sectors, and has created tremendous financial pressure on companies. Flight bans, new regulations, and restrictions increase consumer complaints and are emerging as a big problem for airline companies. Understanding the main reasons triggering complaints and eliminating service failures in the airline industry will be a vital strategic priority for businesses, while reviewing the dimensions of service quality during the COVID-19 pandemic provides an excellent opportunity for academic literature. In this study, 10,594 complaints against two major airlines that offer full-service and low-cost options were analyzed with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm to categorize them by essential topics. Results provide valuable information for both. Furthermore, this study fills the gap in the existing literature by proposing a decision support system to identify significant service failures through passenger complaints in the airline industry utilizing e-complaints during an unusual situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic.},

@article{kumar_2022_an_anomaly_detection_framework_for_twitter_data,
	abstract = {An anomaly indicates something unusual, related to detecting a sudden behavior change, and is also helpful in detecting irregular and malicious behavior. Anomaly detection identifies unusual events, suspicious objects, or observations that differ significantly from normal behavior or patterns. Discrepancies in data can be observed in different ways, such as outliers, standard deviation, and noise. Anomaly detection helps us understand the emergence of specific diseases based on health-related tweets. This paper aims to analyze tweets to detect the unusual emergence of healthcare-related tweets, especially pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19. After pre-processing, this work collected more than 44 thousand tweets and performed topic modeling. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) were deployed for topic modeling, and a query set was designed based on resultant topics. This query set was used for anomaly detection using a sentence transformer. K-means was also employed for clustering outlier tweets from the cleaned tweets based on similarity. Finally, an unusual cluster was selected to identify pandemic-like healthcare emergencies. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can detect a sudden rise of unusual tweets unrelated to regular tweets. The new framework was employed in two case studies for anomaly detection and performed with 78.57\% and 70.19\% accuracy.},

@article{kang_2022_a_study_on_the_influence_of_online_reviews_of_new_products_on_consumers_purchase_decisions_an_empirical_study_on_jdcom,
	abstract = {With the prevalence of the Internet and new media channels, consumer reviews have become one of the main determinants of Consumers' purchasing decisions. This paper uses the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to identify the key factors that are of major concern to consumers, including design factors, laptop setup factors, logistics factors, after-sales factors, and user experience factors. And, we classify these factors into product quality factors and supporting service factors for new products. We then explore the relationship between online reviews and purchase decisions under these different factors, and also further explore the impact of interactions between online review metrics on purchase decisions. Our findings suggest that the impact of online reviews on consumer purchase decisions also varies considerably across different consumer focus factors. In addition, we find that the impact of the interaction between online review features is complex. In particular, consumers do not follow the positive guidance and make purchase decisions as we would expect when confronted with a large number of positive emotional polarity online reviews. Meanwhile, the interaction between negative emotional polarity and variance of online reviews had no significant effect on consumer purchase decisions. The variance of online reviews has a limited role in reducing consumer risk perceptions triggered by negative emotional polarity. Our study provides new evidence for the study of the impact of online reviews through text mining.},

To address the problem of untimely handling of consumer complaints, based on the evolutionary game theory, the e-commerce dispute mediation platform is introduced, the authenticity of consumer complaints and the probability of e-commerce platform to be in the mediation platform are considered, a tripartite evolutionary game model of consumer-mediation platform-e-commerce platform is constructed, and the problem of which strategy the mediation platform and e-commerce platform choose to handle consumer complaints is studied. Numerical simulation and simulation analysis are conducted using MATLAB 2020b, and corresponding suggestions are given. The research results show that under certain conditions when the probability of mediation platform and e-commerce platform positively handling complaint increases or the penalty for consumer distortion complaint increases; when the probability of consumer's real complaint increases, the probability of mediation platform positively handling complaint increases; the consumer tend to choose real complaint, the mediation platform tends to choose positively handling strategy, the e-commerce platform positively enters the mediation platform, the mediation platform and consumer's behavior to the reputation of the e-commerce platform increases, which can promote the e-commerce platform to positively handle the consumer complaint.},

In this context, the aim of the paper is to analyze the dynamics of public opinion on Twitter in the first month after the start of the vaccination process in the UK, with a focus on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy messages. For this purpose, a dataset containing 5,030,866 tweets in English was collected from Twitter between 8 December 2020--7 January 2021. A stance analysis was conducted after comparing several classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The tweets associated to COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy were examined in connection with the major events in the analyzed period, while the main discussion topics were determined using hashtags, n-grams and latent Dirichlet allocation. The results of the study can help the interested parties better address the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy concerns.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              This study aims to identify the topics that users post on Twitter about organic foods and to analyze the emotion-based sentiment of those tweets. The study addresses a call for an application of big data and text mining in different fields of research, as well as proposes more objective research methods in studies on food consumption. There is a growing interest in understanding consumer choices for foods which are caused by the predominant contribution of the food industry to climate change. So far, customer attitudes towards organic food have been studied mostly with self-reported methods, such as questionnaires and interviews, which have many limitations. Therefore, in the present study, we used big data and text mining techniques as more objective methods to analyze the public attitude about organic foods. A total of 43,724 Twitter posts were extracted with streaming Application Programming Interface (API). Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was applied for topic modeling. A test of topic significance was performed to evaluate the quality of the topics. Public sentiment was analyzed based on the NRC emotion lexicon by utilizing
              Syuzhet
              package. Topic modeling results showed that people discuss on variety of themes related to organic foods such as plant-based diet, saving the planet, organic farming and standardization, authenticity, and food delivery, etc. Sentiment analysis results suggest that people view organic foods positively, though there are also people who are skeptical about the claims that organic foods are natural and free from chemicals and pesticides. The study contributes to the field of consumer behavior by implementing research methods grounded in text mining and big data. The study contributes also to the advancement of research in the field of sustainable food consumption by providing a fresh perspective on public attitude toward organic foods, filling the gaps in existing literature and research.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            After the development of Web 2.0 and social networks, analyzing consumers' responses and opinions in real-time became profoundly important to gain business insights. This study aims to identify consumers' preferences and perceptions of genderless fashion trends by text-mining, Latent Dirichlet Allocation-based topic modeling, and time-series linear regression analysis. Unstructured text data from consumer-posted sources, such as blogs and online communities, were collected from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020. We examined 9722 posts that included the keyword ``genderless fashion'' with Python 3.7 software. Results showed that consumers were interested in fragrances, fashion, and beauty brands and products. In particular, 18 topics were extracted: 13 were classified as fashion categories and 5 were derived from beauty and fragrance sectors. Examining the genderless fashion trend development among consumers from 2018 to 2020, ``perfume and scent'' was revealed as the hot topic, whereas ``bags,'' ``all-in-one skin care,'' and ``set-up suit'' were cold topics, declining in popularity among consumers. The findings contribute to contemporary fashion trends and provide in-depth knowledge about consumers' perceptions using big data analysis methods and offer insights into product development strategies.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In an effort to understand the legislative agenda setting impacts of social media content, the present study analyzes political discourse on Twitter regarding the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to dissect the Twitter conversation aimed at Representative Karen Bass, the sponsor of the H.R.7120, in the weeks leading up to the bill's filing, our analysis of nearly 68,000 tweets posted in the days before the bill's filing reveals that constituents strongly urged the Representative to work on legislation targeted on police reform -- offering evidence of how constituents demanded, and drove, legislative action. Considering our findings, we argue that there is considerable potential for social media to serve as an amplifier of social issues and concerns among constituents. Through this process, we posit that social media can prove to be a vital catalyst in social justice reform.},

@article{shi_2021_fault_diagnosis_of_signal_equipment_on_the_lanzhou_xinjiang_high_speed_railway_using_machine_learning_for_natural_language_processing,
	abstract = {The Lanzhou-Xinjiang (Lan-Xin) high-speed railway is one of the principal sections of the railway network in western China, and signal equipment is of great importance in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the high-speed railway. Over a long period, in the railway operation and maintenance process, the railway signaling and communications department has recorded a large amount of unstructured text information about equipment faults in the form of natural language. However, due to irregularities in the recording methods of these data, it is difficult to use directly. In this paper, a method based on natural language processing (NLP) was adopted to analyze and classify this information. First, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model was used to extract the semantic features of the text, which were then expressed in the corresponding topic feature space. Next, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used to construct a signal equipment fault diagnostic model that reduced the impact of sample data imbalance on the classification accuracy. This was compared and analyzed with the traditional Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms. This study used signal equipment failure text data from the Lan-Xin high-speed railway to conduct experimental analysis and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments showed that the accuracy of the SVM classification algorithm could reach 0.84 after being combined with the LDA topic model, which verifies that the natural language processing method can effectively realize the fault diagnosis of signal equipment and has certain guiding significance for the maintenance of field signal equipment.},

            In today's era, company performance is influenced by quick and easy responses to interacting with users. Twitter is one of the social media which is believed that public opinion on Twitter can influence the government or companies to make policies. Public criticism on Twitter is more quickly responded than people who contacting customer service directly, this is because the companies or government do not want their image to be bad due to delays in responding to public complaints on Twitter. Studies related to opinion writing on social media can use the method of topic modeling and sentiment analysis in order to get what topics are currently being discussed and also the value of their sentiments. Modeling of the topic was carried out using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and sentiment analysis using the Indonesian Sentiment Lexicon. A case study of public opinion on BPJS Kesehatan using Twitter data for 3 months from February to April 2020, obtained 5 main topics with the BPJS Kesehatan's New Contribution Rate as a trending topic with a sentiment value of 61.7\% positive and 38.3\% negative.},

@article{barnes_2021_empirical_identification_of_skills_gaps_between_chief_information_officer_supply_and_demand_a_resource_based_view_using_machine_learning,
	abstract = {Purpose
              The role of emerging digital technologies is of growing strategic importance as it provides significant competitive advantage to organisations. The chief information officer (CIO) plays a pivotal role in facilitating the process of digital transformation. Whilst demand continues to increase, the supply of suitably qualified applicants is lacking, with many companies forced to choose information technology (IT) or marketing specialists instead. This research seeks to analyse the organisational capabilities required and the level of fit within the industry between CIO requirements and appointments via the resource-based view.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Job postings and CIO curriculum vitae were collected and analysed through the lens of organisational capability theory using the machine learning method of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
            
            
              Findings
              This research identifies gaps between the capabilities demanded by organisations and supplied by CIOs. In particular, soft, general, non-specific capabilities are over-supplied, while rarer specific skills, qualifications and experience are under-supplied.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The research is useful for practitioners (e.g. potential CIO candidates) to understand current market requirements and for companies aiming to develop internal training that meet present and future skill gaps. It also could be useful for professional organisations (e.g. CIO Forum) to validate the need to develop mentoring schemes that help meet such high demand and relative undersupply of qualified CIOs.
            
            
              Originality/value
              By applying LDA, the paper provides a new research method and process for identifying competence requirements and gaps as well as ascertaining job fit. This approach may be helpful to other domains of research in the process of identifying specific competences required by organisations for particular roles as well as to understand the level of fit between such requirements and a potential pool of applicants. Further, the study provides unique insight into the current supply and demand for the role of CIO through the lens of resource-based view (RBV). This provides a contribution to the stream of information systems (IS) research focused on understanding CIO archetypes and how individual capabilities provide value to companies.},

	abstract = {During the Covid-19 pandemic, almost all community activities are conducted from home. Therefore, video conference technology is needed for people to carry out their normal activities from home. One of the video conference applications is ZOOM Cloud Meetings. Applications certainly have been reviewed given by their users as a reference for new users and companies of the application to know the application's performance. However, in reviews, some constraints are the number of reviews as well as irregular. Therefore, a solution is needed with sentiment analysis that aims to classify the reviews of the application to be organized by categorizing positive or negative sentiment. In this study, aspect-based sentiment analysis was conducted on ZOOM Cloud Meetings app reviews from Google Play Store. The analysis's result of the review data obtained three aspects, namely aspects of usability, system, and appearance. The modeling topic used is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method and classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). This research resulted in the best performance with the best parameters resulting in the performance accuracy of usability aspect is 88.83\%, system aspect with 91.2\%, appearance aspect with 94.78\%, and performance accuracy of all aspects 91.61\%.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives  In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, researchers around the world conducted various studies on different dimensions of the disease. Accordingly, this study aimed at investigating the structure and topics of COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran.Material and Methods This applied research, adopting an analytical approach, was conducted using bibliometric and text mining methods. The statistical population was the COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran in 2020. These research projects were extracted from the database of Iran national committee for ethics in biomedical research (ethics.research.ac.ir). To identify the topics of the research projects on COVID-19 for text mining the English Language titles of the projects were used, topic modeling algorithms was done by the Python programming language. Results  We selected a total of 6641 COVID-19 research projects approved and conducted in 93 different Iranian universities and research centers. .of the main bulk of the research in this area had been conducted by Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, and Shiraz University of Medical Sciences including 687,662, and 351 cases respectively. COVID-19 Research projects fell into 12 topical categories including Treatment, Care needs of medical staff, Factors affecting disease severity, Mental health and preventive, Diagnostic and laboratory measures, Immunology studies, Vitamins and minerals, Cardiovascular disease, Vaccine studies, Job and life stress, Experiences of nurses, patients and their families and Prevalence and symptoms. Conclusion   The results of this study clearly show the structural and topic status of research COVID-19 projects approved in Iran during the COVID-19 epidemic. Extended Abstract  Background and Objectives   In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, researchers around the world have conducted various studies on different dimensions of the disease. The researchers and various research teams have designed and conducted an extensive range of studies related to COVID-19 including epidemiology, disease surveillance, consequences of the disease, and clinical trials. In Iran, different ongoing or completed research projects have also been approved to identify various aspects of the disease. Research project proposals are documents prepared by researchers to carry out research projects and are formulated according to particular demands for research in the society on various subjects such as disease burden, epidemics, threats and natural factors. Therefore, this study investigated the structure and topics of COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran.  Material and Methods   This applied research, adopting an analytical approach, was conducted using bibliometric and text mining methods. The statistical population was the COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran in 2020. These research projects were extracted from the database of Iran national committee for ethics in biomedical research (ethics.research.ac.ir). To identify the topics of the research projects on COVID-19bytheir English titles, topic modeling algorithms were used in the Python programming language.This database, includes the bibliographic data of all research projects which have been approved by the medical sciences, received implementation ethics license. The projects related to medical sciences are registered in this database to receive an ethics code before implementation; thus, all Iranian projects within COVID-19 topical area are registered in this database before being implemented, and their bibliographic data can be retrieved and accessed. After extracting data related to the approved COVID-19 research projects from the mentioned database, a topical modeling algorithm named Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was employed to identify the topics of research projects by the English titles of COVID-19 approved research projects in Iran, using text mining techniques. Text mining process employed in this study includes three stages; (1) data preprocessing (2) implementation of text mining and visualization techniques, and (3) the analysis of results and knowledge extraction. In the present investigation, Python programming language and its libraries related to text mining, such as Gensim, NLTK, and Spacy, were used to implement text mining algorithms. Results  We selected a total of 6641 COVID-19 research projects approved and conducted in 93 different Iranian universities and research centers. .of the main bulk of the research in this area had been conducted by Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, and Shiraz University of Medical Sciences including 687,662, and 351 cases respectively. The highest number of research projects approved in Iran included 1238, 796, 796 cases in April, May, and March, respectively. The results also revealed that the researchers to contribute most, as the main executor, to the approved research projects included Amir Vahedian Azimi from Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Jamshid Yazdani Charati from Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Ramin Sami from Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and Hossein Sheybani from Shahroud University of Medical Sciences each of whom had had 12 research projects approved. The results of text mining techniques also indicated that the terms COVID, patients, evaluation, hospital, and disease were among the most frequent words used in the titles of COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran.The results obtained from topical modeling have identified 12 distinct themes for the research projects in this area, including treatment, care needs of medical staff, factors of disease severity, mental health and preventive behavior, diagnostic and laboratory studies, Immunology studies, vitamins and minerals, cardiovascular diseases, vaccine studies, job and life stress, experiences of nurses, patients and their families and prevalence and symptoms. Conclusion  In the present study, bibliometric and text mining techniques were applied to identify the topical structure of COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran. The results of this study clearly depicted the structural and topic status of research COVID-19 projects approved in Iran during the COVID-19 epidemic. The results seem to be useful for planners and policy-makers in research and medical organizations to identify topics that are understudied by researchers and also to formulate new research priorities and requirements in this field. Practical Implications of Research  This research has used bibliometric and text mining techniques to identify the thematic structure of research projects approved by Covid-19 in Iran. The results of this study can be useful for planners and policy makers in research and medical organizations in order to identify topics that are less frequently considered by researchers and also to formulate new research priorities and requirements in this field. Ethical Considerations  The present study was extracted from a research project approved by the Vice Chancellor for Research andTechnology of Gonabad University of Medical Sciences with the code A-10-1263-5. Conflict of Interest   The authors state that there is no conflict of interest in the present study. Aknowledgment   Researchers express their gratitude to the Vice Chancellor for Research, Technology and Infectious Diseases Research Center of Gonabad University of Medical Sciences for their financial and spiritual support of this research.},

@article{wang_2021_technology_hotspot_tracking_topic_discovery_and_evolution_of_chinas_blockchain_patents_based_on_a_dynamic_lda_model,
	abstract = {Tracking scientific and technological (S\&T) research hotspots can help scholars to grasp the status of current research and develop regular patterns in the field over time. It contributes to the generation of new ideas and plays an important role in promoting the writing of scientific research projects and scientific papers. Patents are important S\&T resources, which can reflect the development status of the field. In this paper, we use topic modeling, topic intensity, and evolutionary computing models to discover research hotspots and development trends in the field of blockchain patents. First, we propose a time-based dynamic latent Dirichlet allocation (TDLDA) modeling method based on a probabilistic graph model and knowledge representation learning for patent text mining. Second, we present a computational model, topic intensity (TI), that expresses the topic strength and evolution. Finally, the point-wise mutual information (PMI) value is used to evaluate topic quality. We obtain 20 hot topics through TDLDA experiments and rank them according to the strength calculation model. The topic evolution model is used to analyze the topic evolution trend from the perspectives of rising, falling, and stable. From the experiments we found that 8 topics showed an upward trend, 6 topics showed a downward trend, and 6 topics became stable or fluctuated. Compared with the baseline method, TDLDA can have the best effect when K is 40 or less. TDLDA is an effective topic model that can extract hot topics and evolution trends of blockchain patent texts, which helps researchers to more accurately grasp the research direction and improves the quality of project application and paper writing in the blockchain technology domain.},

	abstract = {Data analysis becomes difficult with the increase of large amounts of data. More specifically, extracting meaningful insights from this vast amount of data and grouping them based on their shared features without human intervention requires advanced methodologies. There are topic modeling methods to overcome this problem in text analysis for downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and news classification. In this research, we benchmark several classifiers, namely Random Forest, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, using the classical LDA and n-stage LDA topic modeling methods for feature extraction in headlines classification. We run our experiments on 3 and 5 classes publicly available Turkish and English datasets.

	abstract = {With the  development  of web technologies, databases  and social   networks   etc.   a   large   amount   of   text   data   is generated  each  day.  Mostof  the  data  on  the  internet  is  in unstructured  form.  This  unstructured  data  can   provide valuable knowledge. For  getting valuable  knowledge from text  data  text  mining  techniques  are  used  widely.  As  each day  large  amounts  of  research  papers  were  published  in journals  and  conferences.  These  research  papers are  very valuable   for   future  research  and  investigations.   These research  papers  act  as  a  source  for  future  innovations. Researchers    write    review    papers    to    give    updated knowledge about the specific field. But review papers used a limited number of  papers and involved  manually reading each  paper.  Due  to  the  large  volume  of  research  papers published each day, it is not possible for the researchers to go  through  each  paper  to  find  the  updated  knowledge about  their  field  of  interest.  To  automate  the  literature analysis  process  different  techniques  of  text  mining  were used.   This   paper   provides   a   review   of   text   mining techniques   used   in   automatic   literature   analysis.   We collected  papers  in  which  previous  literature  is  used  with text  mining  techniques  to  get  valuable  knowledge.  This review   paper   presented   an   overview   of   text   mining techniques,  their  evaluation criteria,  their  limitations  and challenges for exploring literature to find research trends.},

	abstract = {Abundant natural resources are the basis of urbanisation and industrialisation. Citizens are the key factor in promoting a sustainable supply of natural resources and the high-quality development of urban areas. This study focuses on the co-production behaviours of citizens regarding urban natural resource assets in the age of big data, and uses the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm and the stepwise regression analysis method to evaluate citizens' experiences and feelings related to the urban capitalisation of natural resources. Results show that, firstly, the machine learning algorithm based on natural language processing can effectively identify and deal with the demands of urban natural resource assets. Secondly, in the experience of urban natural resources, citizens pay more attention to the combination of history, culture, infrastructure and natural landscape. Unique natural resource  can enhance citizens' sense of participation. Finally, the scenery, entertainment and quality and value of urban natural resources are the influencing factors of citizens' satisfaction.},

With the introduction of the internet, Indonesia is expected to gain more than a hundred billion US Dollars and twenty-six million job openings by 2030. The rising usage of information technology prompts regulators to develop The Electronic Information Transaction Act to protect the populace from cybercrime. However, the law attracts numerous criticism due to its vague interpretation. This resulted in numerous arrests of innocents throughout Indonesia. Thus, the public is trying to voice their opinions on social media for the sake of preventing any more cases in the future. The usage of Latent Dirichlet Allocation could provide numerous benefits for this research. The separation between latent topics among random mixtures helps to identify the common ground and correlation between each post. These latent topics will be elaborated with a sample post to provide insights and expectations of the public towards the law.},

Awareness of BIM application hotspots and forecasting its trends can drive innovations in construction field. Using patents as data resources, this study develops an effective framework integrating the citation network analysis and the topic clustering technology to identify BIM application information and forecast its trends. This framework comprises three-step analysis:(1) quantitative characteristic analysis of patent outputs; (2) Social Network Analysis (SNA)-based co-occurrence network analysis; and (3) identification of BIM topics using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Finally, the case demonstrates the effectiveness of this framework contributing to promote technological development and innovation of BIM. The contributions of this study are threefold: (1) an innovative text mining-based framework for BIM patent analysis in construction is developed; (2) patents that have focused on identifying the application hotspots and development trend of BIM in accordance with our developed framework are reviewed; and (3) a signpost for technological development and innovation of BIM is provided.},

	abstract = {The literature discussing the concepts, technologies, and ICT-based urban innovation approaches of smart cities has been growing, along with initiatives from cities all over the world that are competing to improve their services and become smart and sustainable. However, current studies that provide a comprehensive understanding and reveal smart and sustainable city research trends and characteristics are still lacking. Meanwhile, policymakers and practitioners alike need to pursue progressive development. In response to this shortcoming, this research offers content analysis studies based on topic modeling approaches to capture the evolution and characteristics of topics in the scientific literature on smart and sustainable city research. More importantly, a novel topic-detecting algorithm based on the deep learning and clustering techniques, namely deep autoencoders-based fuzzy C-means (DFCM), is introduced for analyzing the research topic trend. The topics generated by this proposed algorithm have relatively higher coherence values than those generated by previously used topic detection methods, namely non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and eigenspace-based fuzzy C-means (EFCM). The 30 main topics that appeared in topic modeling with the DFCM algorithm were classified into six groups (technology, energy, environment, transportation, e-governance, and human capital and welfare) that characterize the six dimensions of smart, sustainable city research.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we compare the performances of traditional machine learning models using feature engineering and word vectors and the state-of-the-art language model BERT using word embeddings on three datasets. We also consider the time and cost efficiency of feature engineering compared to BERT. From our results we conclude that the use of the BERT model was only worth the time and cost trade-off for one of the three datasets we used for comparison, where the BERT model significantly outperformed any kind of traditional classifier that uses feature vectors, instead of embeddings. Using the BERT model for the other datasets only achieved an increase of 0.03 and 0.05 of accuracy and F1 score respectively, which could be argued makes its use not worth the time and cost of GPU.},

	abstract = {How do climate change deniers differ from believers? Is there any correlation between human sentiment and deviations from historic temperature? We answer nine such questions using 13 years of Twitter data and 15 million tweets. Seven aspects are explored, namely, user gender, climate change stance and sentiment, aggressiveness, deviations from historic temperature, topics discussed, and environmental disaster events. We found that: a) climate change deniers use the term global warming much often than believers and use aggressive language, while believers tweet more about taking actions to fight the phenomenon, b) deniers are more present in the American Region, South Africa, Japan, and Eastern China and less present in Europe, India, and Central Africa, c) people connect much more the warm temperatures with man-made climate change than cold temperatures, d) the same regions that had more climate change deniers also tweet with negative sentiment, e) a positive correlation is observed between human sentiment and deviations from historic temperature; when the deviation is between −1.143$\,^{\circ}$

	abstract = {This paper presents the findings of an exploratory study on the continuously generating Big Data on Twitter related to the sharing of information, news, views, opinions, ideas, knowledge, feedback, and experiences about the COVID-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on the Omicron variant, which is the globally dominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 at this time. A total of 12028 tweets about the Omicron variant were studied, and the specific characteristics of tweets that were analyzed include - sentiment, language, source, type, and embedded URLs. The findings of this study are manifold. First, from sentiment analysis, it was observed that 50.5\% of tweets had the \&lsquo;neutral\&rsquo; emotion. The other emotions - \&lsquo;bad\&rsquo;, \&lsquo;good\&rsquo;, \&lsquo;terrible\&rsquo;, and \&lsquo;great\&rsquo; were found in 15.6\%, 14.0\%, 12.5\%, and 7.5\% of the tweets, respectively. Second, the findings of language interpretation showed that 65.9\% of the tweets were posted in English. It was followed by Spanish or Castillian, French, Italian, Japanese, and other languages, which were found in 10.5\%, 5.1\%, 3.3\%, 2.5\%, and \&amp;lt;2\% of the tweets, respectively. Third, the findings from source tracking showed that \&ldquo;Twitter for Android\&rdquo; was associated with 35.2\% of tweets. It was followed by \&ldquo;Twitter Web App\&rdquo;, \&ldquo;Twitter for iPhone\&rdquo;, \&ldquo;Twitter for iPad\&rdquo;, \&ldquo;TweetDeck\&rdquo;, and all other sources that accounted for 29.2\%, 25.8\%, 3.8\%, 1.6\%, and \&amp;lt;1\% of the tweets, respectively. Fourth, studying the type of tweets revealed that retweets accounted for 60.8\% of the tweets, it was followed by original tweets and replies that accounted for 19.8\% and 19.4\% of the tweets, respectively. Finally, in terms of embedded URL analysis, the most common URLs embedded in the tweets were found to be twitter.com, which was followed by biorxiv.org, nature.com, wapo.st, nzherald.co.nz, recvprofits.com, science.org, and other URLs.},

	abstract = {With the continuous development of the social economy, the urban residential structure is also changing, and people have higher and higher requirements for the living environment. Moreover, the landscape construction of public spaces in cities is an important part of the city. It is easy to neglect the comprehensive consideration of historical development and regional culture in architectural projects. The overall lack of individuality in urban design, the lack of characteristics of adapting measures to local conditions, and the blind emphasis on architectural landscaping have led to a serious lack of regional cultural characteristics and spiritual culture in public places. Therefore, in terms of the problems of insufficient landscape construction quality and green concepts being insufficient in the construction environment of cities, an evaluation method system is established in the paper to further study the shortcomings of the scenic area architecture. What is more, relying on the personal experience of the users in the scenic spot and understanding the real needs of the public space landscape environment around the scenic spot, scientific methods and a complete system are applied to make an overall assessment of the public space in the built residential area. Besides, according to the data analysis of the simulation experiment, the advantages and disadvantages of the public space in the residential area are extracted. Combined with the current research status, the green concept design strategy of the public space landscape environment in the scenic spot is summarized. Lastly, according to the data analysis of the simulation experiment, the evaluation satisfaction of the activity atmosphere, plant configuration, and overall layout is improved by 4.2\%, 3.7\%, and 3.1\% compared with other methods, which proves that this study has a more reasonable planning program to meet the various needs of public open space. The development of urban landscape design provides a valuable reference.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Some factors in the product development process can increase success. Evaluating the risks and success factors is necessary for a more successful product development process. Some inadequacies arise in classical risk assessment methods due to the subjective nature of likelihood and severity ratings. Different probability and impact values can give the same risk size. Due to these inadequacies, doubts about the accuracy of risk prioritization may arise. In this study, a new risk prioritization model is proposed to eliminate these doubts and to consider their contribution to the success of the process they affect while prioritizing the risks, with a detailed literature review and the support of the experts of the applied company, the risks affecting the product development process. The importance levels of risks and success factors were calculated using the analytical hierarchy process. With the proposed model, unlike the classical method, when calculating the risk size, the risk weight and the total score from the success factors are added to the likelihood and severity values of the risk. Thus, companies will obtain more detailed and objective results, considering success factors and risk importance levels, and use the resources they allocate for risk reduction activities more efficiently.},

@article{jia_2021_effectiveness_evaluation_method_of_application_of_mobile_communication_system_based_on_factor_analysis,
	abstract = {The application mode of army mobile communication networks is closely related to combat mission and application environment. Different combat missions and application environments result in different network structures and different service priorities, which requires a semi-automatic system to support the network scheme design. Therefore, evaluating the efficiency of network schemes generated by automatic planning is a problem that needs to be urgently addressed. In the past, researchers have proposed a variety of methods to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile communication systems, most of which are based on simulation methods and ignore the historical data of network usage. This paper studies an effectiveness evaluation method of mobile communication network design schemes and proposes a design scheme for the evaluation and optimization of network plans. Furthermore, the improved method of effectiveness evaluation based on factor analysis is discussed in detail. The method not only effectively uses historical data but also reduces the amount of data collection and calculation. In order to adapt to the preference requirements of different task scenarios, a decision preference setting method based on cluster analysis is proposed, which can render the output optimization result more reasonable and feasible.},

This paper scopes the weekly dynamics of the information space represented by Russian social media (Twitter and LiveJournal) during a critical period (massive COVID-19 outbreak and first governmental measures). The approach is twofold: 1) build the time series of topic similarity indicators by identifying COVID-related topics in each week and measuring user contribution to the topic space, and 2) cluster user activity and display user-topic relationships on graphs in a dashboard application. The paper describes the development of the pipeline, explains the choices made and provides a case study of the adaptation to virus control measures. The results confirm that social processes and behavior in response to pandemic-triggered changes can be successfully traced in social media. Moreover, the adaptation trends revealed by psychological and sociological studies are reflected in our data and can be explored using the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Vojvodina Province (Northern Serbia) represents a multicultural area inhabited by around thirty nations and national or ethnic groups with their authentic tradition and culture. The gastronomy of Vojvodina has been forming as a reflection of geographic characteristics---natural conditions and social events in this area. The life numerous nations share on this fertile soil of Vojvodina has initiated mutual impact of various customs, which contributed to the creation of a unique and specific Vojvodina cuisine. In this paper, mixed-method research approach was applied. The application of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was preceded by a survey research on the sample of 289 guests in the restaurants on the territory of Vojvodina. The aim of the research was to define the key motives when choosing a traditional Vojvodina dish. In the second stage, AHP model was used for ranking factors significant for choosing traditional food by 29 experts in the field of hospitality and gastronomy. The result shows that Sensory appeal is the most important criterion for choosing traditional food in restaurants by the experts, followed by Health concern, and Familiarity.},

@article{liu_2022_what_affects_the_online_ratings_of_restaurant_consumers_a_research_perspective_on_text_mining_big_data_analysis,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Despite a significant focus on customer evaluation and sentiment analysis, limited attention has been paid to discrete emotional perspective in terms of the emotionality used in text. This paper aims to extend the general-sentiment dictionary in Chinese to a restaurant-domain-specific dictionary, visualize spatiotemporal sentiment trends, identify the main discrete emotions that affect customers' ratings in a restaurant setting and identify constituents of influential emotions.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              
                A total of 683,610 online restaurant reviews downloaded from
                Dianping.com
                were analyzed by a sentiment dictionary optimized by the authors; the main emotions (joy, love, trust, anger, sadness and surprise) that affect online ratings were explored by using multiple linear regression methods. After tracking these sentiment review texts, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and LDA models with term frequency-inverse document frequency as weights were used to find the factors that constitute influential emotions.
              
            
            
              Findings
              The results show that it is viable to optimize or expand sentiment dictionary by word similarity. The findings highlight that love and anger have the highest effect on online ratings. The main factors that constitute consumers' anger (local characteristics, incorrect food portions and unobtrusive location) and love (comfortable dining atmosphere, obvious local characteristics and complete supporting services) are identified. Different from previous studies, negativity bias is not observed, which poses a question of whether it has to do with Chinese culture.
            
            
              Practical implications
              These findings can help managers monitor the true quality of restaurant service in an area on time. Based on the results, restaurant operators can better decide which aspects they should pay more attention to; platforms can operate better and can have more manageable webpage settings; and consumers can easily capture the quality of restaurants to make better purchase decisions.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study builds upon the existing general sentiment dictionary in Chinese and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the first to provide a restaurant-domain-specific sentiment dictionary and use it for analysis. It also reveals the constituents of two prominent emotions (love and anger) in the case of restaurant reviews.},

@article{nuryanti_2021_a_vehicle_routing_problem_optimization_with_drone_using_tabu_search_algorithm_and_analytical_hierarchy_process,
	abstract = {This research presents optimization of the fastest route using Drone. Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones (VRPD) is used for planning the mapping of areas with minimal makespan. Drone point route design aims to mapping the area with considering the boundaries. In this paper, an optimization method using the Tabu Search algorithm and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to resolve VRPD problems is proposed. Tabu Search algorithm is suitable for the implementation of Vehicle Routing Problem because it is able to find the closest distance optimally with guiding other processes using a series of movements to change one solution to another. The optimization process using Tabu Search can find a suitable pair of points so that the closest route can be found. AHP is used for the weighting process and determining the hierarchy of route selection by prioritizing routes that meet the criteria and the appropriate weights. The optimization resulted in a 7.08\% reduction in the distance and significantly reduce the makespan as well as the metaheuristic approach. Experimental processes and performance analysis are carried out to find that this method can consistently produce better and optimal solutions.

	abstract = {The rapidly expanding e-health market tends to reinvent the roles of science, entrepreneurship, and state. However, the results of such reinvention remain unclear. This study investigates the decade-long history (2011--2021) of the promotion of techno-scientific biomedical communication by pro-government non-profit organizations in Russia. In 2021, the World Bank pointed out that digital technologies have played a critical role in the pandemic in Russia and Russia's economic recovery is gathering pace. Thus, Russia tends to correspond to many other emerging health markets. We compare texts from non-profit organizations' websites and Facebook accounts with official state actions and the national mass media health agenda. The instruments that were used for text mining were topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation and an algorithm for keyphrase relationship visualization. The results revealed that promotion started no later than 2011 as a general private initiative in health. Throughout the state reforms and geopolitical crisis of 2014, in 2017--2019 digitalization was finally chosen as a model for the healthcare system. Simultaneously, the idea of digital reform for the health system was disseminated by the mass media. The pandemic drew attention to this communication, but it did not create significant change. Pro-government non-profit organizations continue to promote new directions for biomedical communication in Russia.},

@article{nastisin_2021_gender_differences_in_the_perception_of_selected_aspectsof_social_media_as_part_of_ecommerce_activities_during_a_pandemic,
	abstract = {Objective - In the current time of pandemic crisis, social media is one of the most effective tools for ecommerce to keep in touch with customers. One of the most affected segments worldwide is undoubtedly the tourist segment. Our goal was to examine the perception of selected aspects of social media in the light of gender differences during a pandemic in the tourist segment, when these can convince or discourage the customer to buy.

Methodology/Technique - Data collection took place from the beginning of 2021 and lasted 3 months. It was an online questionnaire and focused on customers of travel agencies. A total of 723 valid responses were collected. These were analyzed for statistical significance of gender differences using SPSS software.

Findings - The results identified significant differences in perceptions between men and women in some of the areas examined. The best forms of content that work best on these platforms have been identified. Attitudes towards communication through social media for marketing purposes were also identified. These were perceived positively in order to support purchasing decisions. We also identified a great need for personalization in communication via social media in a given tourist segment.

Novelty - All findings show great implication potential for both theory and practice. The pandemic situation has changed market conditions and many of these changes will persist beyond. There is therefore a need to examine these contexts in the future. Managers in the tourism segment are able to incorporate the identified results into the way they manage their online activities and manage their social media.

Type of Paper - Empirical

Keywords: Social Media; Ecommerce; Tourism; Pandemic; Differences; Analysis.

@article{zheng_2022_research_on_domain_information_mining_and_theme_evolution_of_scientific_papers,
	abstract = {In recent years, with the increase of social investment in scientific research, the number of research results in various fields has increased significantly. Cross-disciplinary research results have gradually become an emerging frontier research direction. There is a certain dependence between a large number of research results. It is difficult to effectively analyze today's scientific research results when looking at a single research field in isolation. How to effectively use the huge number of scientific papers to help researchers becomes a challenge. This paper introduces the research status at home and abroad in terms of domain information mining and topic evolution law of scientific and technological papers from three aspects: the semantic feature representation learning of scientific and technological papers, the field information mining of scientific and technological papers, and the mining and prediction of research topic evolution rules of scientific and technological papers.},

@article{daoud_2022_topical_and_non_topical_approaches_to_measure_similarity_between_arabic_questions,
	abstract = {Questions are crucial expressions in any language. Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Natural Language Understanding (NLU) applications, such as question-answering computer systems, automatic chatting apps (chatbots), digital virtual assistants, and opinion mining, can benefit from accurately identifying similar questions in an effective manner. We detail methods for identifying similarities between Arabic questions that have been posted online by Internet users and organizations. Our novel approach uses a non-topical rule-based methodology and topical information (textual similarity, lexical similarity, and semantic similarity) to determine if a pair of Arabic questions are similarly paraphrased. Our method counts the lexical and linguistic distances between each question. Additionally, it identifies questions in accordance with their format and scope using expert hypotheses (rules) that have been experimentally shown to be useful and practical. Even if there is a high degree of lexical similarity between a When question (Timex Factoid---inquiring about time) and a Who inquiry (Enamex Factoid---asking about a named entity), they will not be similar. In an experiment using 2200 question pairs, our method attained an accuracy of 0.85, which is remarkable given the simplicity of the solution and the fact that we did not employ any language models or word embedding. In order to cover common Arabic queries presented by Arabic Internet users, we gathered the questions from various online forums and resources. In this study, we describe a unique method for detecting question similarity that does not require intensive processing, a sizable linguistic corpus, or a costly semantic repository. Because there are not many rich Arabic textual resources, this is especially important for informal Arabic text processing on the Internet.},

	abstract = {Online mental health service (OMHS) platforms have contributed significantly to the public's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. However, it remains unclear why the public used OMHS platforms for psychological help-seeking (PHS) behavior and how PHS behavior varied across different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the ecological PHS behavior data from two OMHS platforms, we extracted population, psychological problems, and influential factors of PHS behavior by text mining and time series analysis methods. Seven top-ranked psychological problems (i.e., depression and anxiety, lack of interest, suicidal tendencies, social phobia, feelings of being worried and afraid, suffering, anger) and seven influential factors (i.e., interpersonal relationships, love, family, work, psychotherapy, personal characteristics, marriage) were found. The online PHS behaviors related to different psychological problems and influential factors remained a growing trend before 2020 and have been increasing significantly due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Four main stages were found during the pandemic according to the changes in the online PHS population: sharp growth, significant decline, slight rebound, and slow decline. This study identified large-scale, spontaneous PHS behaviors among the online public during the COVID-19 pandemic and the various psychological problems and influential factors that varied across different stages of the pandemic, suggesting that the government and health practitioners should adopt effective policies and strategies to prevent and intervene in mental health problems for the online public.},

@article{ying_2020_application_of_text_mining_in_identifying_the_factors_of_supply_chain_financing_risk_management,
	abstract = {Purpose
              This study aims to clarify the risk management practices of banks as supply chain finance (SCF) service providers.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Using 4,014 evaluation and approval reports, this study constructed five risk management factors and examined their functions with secondary data. Two text-mining techniques (i.e. word sense induction, TF--IDF) were used to equip the classic routine of dictionary-based content analysis.
            
            
              Findings
              This research successfully identified four important risk management factors: relationship-based assessment, asset monitoring, cash flow monitoring and supply chain collaboration. The default-preventing effect of these factors are different and contingent on the type of financing contexts (i.e. preshipment, postshipment).
            
            
              Practical implications
              The empirical evidences provide practical implications for SCF service providers to manage risk. SCF service providers are suggested to pay more attention to cash flow monitoring when providing postshipment financing services and shift the focus to relationship building and supply chain collaboration when providing preshipment financing services.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The study shows that a large volume of textual materials can provide adequate clues for researches as long as they are mined with suitable analytic techniques and approaches. Based on the results, SCF service providers can identify problems of their operations and directions for improvement. In addition, the risk management vocabulary from the E\&A reports can be utilized by SCF service providers to digitize their loan approving process and, further, to facilitate the decision-makings.},

The purpose of people gathering at Skytrax is to make better choices using the actual experiences of other customers who have experienced airlines. Online reviews written by customers with experience using airlines in Asia were collected. The data collected were online reviews from 27 airlines, with more than 14,000 reviews. Topic modeling and sentiment analysis were used with the collected data to figure out what kinds of important words are in the online reviews. As a result of the topic modeling, `seat', `service', and `meal' were significant issues in the flight through frequency analysis. Additionally, the result revealed that delay was the main issue, which can affect customer dissatisfaction while `staff service' can make customers satisfied through sentiment analysis as the result shows the `staff service' with meal and food in the topic modeling.},

This has resulted in a tremendous availability of research literature, which keeps evolving itself. Thus, identification of core research areas and trends in such ever-evolving literature is not only challenging but interesting too. An empirical overview of contemporary machine learning methods, which have the potential to expedite evidence synthesis within research literature, has been explained. This manuscript proposes Simulating Expert comprehension for Analyzing Research trends (SEAR) framework, which can perform subjective and quantitative investigation over enormous literature. TRENDMINER is the use case designed exclusively for the SEAR framework. TRENDMINER uncovered the intellectual structure of a corpus of 444 abstracts of research articles (published during 2010--2019) on Android malware analysis and detection. The study concludes with the identification of three core research areas, twenty-seven research trends. The study also suggests the potential future research directions.},

@article{yaman_2022_automated_multi_label_classification_on_fertilizer_themed_patent_documents_in_indonesia,
	abstract = {Patent literature research has a high scientific value for the industrial, commercial, legal, and policymaking communities. Therefore, patent analysis has become crucial. Patent topic classification is an important process in patent topic modeling analysis. However, the classification process is time-consuming and expensive, as it is usually carried out manually by an expert. Moreover, a patent document may be categorised in more than one category or label, further complicating the task. As the number of patent documents submitted increases, creating an automated patent classification system that yields accurate results becomes increasingly critical. Therefore, in this paper, we analyse the performance of two algorithms with regard to multi-label classification in patent documents: multi-label k-nearest neighbor (ML-KNN) and classifier chain k-nearest neighbor (CC-KNN), combined with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). These two methods have a considerable advantage in handling the continuously updated dataset; they also exhibit superior performance compared to other multi-label learning algorithms. This study also compares these two algorithms with the term frequency (TF)-weighting measure. The optimal value obtained is based on the following evaluation parameters: micro F1, accuracy, Hamming loss, and one error. The result shows that the ML-KNN method is better than the CC-KNN method and that the multi-label classification based on topics (patent LDA) is better than the TF-weighting technique.},

	abstract = {With the evaluation of the software industry, a huge number of software applications are designing, developing, and uploading to multiple online repositories. To find out the same type of category and resource utilization of applications, researchers must adopt manual working. To reduce their efforts, a solution has been proposed that works in two phases. In first phase, a semantic analysis-based keywords and variables identification process has been proposed. Based on the semantics, designed a dataset having two classes: one represents application type and the other corresponds to application keywords. Afterward, in second phase, input preprocessed dataset to manifold machine learning techniques (Decision Table, Random Forest, OneR, Randomizable Filtered Classifier, Logistic model tree) and compute their performance based on TP Rate, FP Rate, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, MCC, ROC Area, PRC Area, and Accuracy (\%). For evaluation purposes, We have used an R language library called latent semantic analysis for creating semantics, and the Weka tool is used for measuring the performance of algorithms. Results show that the random forest depicts the highest accuracy which is 99.3\% due to its parametric function evaluation and less misclassification error.},

@article{chen_2022_analyzing_legal_education_mobile_learners_behavior_using_deep_learning_under_social_media,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Under emerging social media technology, mobile learners' behavior analysis and legality education have important practical significance. The research aims to detect the mobile learning (M-learning) learners' behavior in legality education under the background of the Internet era and improve the learning and teaching effect of online legality education and law popularization.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This paper proposes a model based on deep learning (DL) fuzzy clustering analysis (FCA), and bidirectional encoder and decoder (ENDEC) of converter model to detect the mobile learners' behaviors in online legality education under the current social media. Then, the effectiveness of the proposed model is tested. The proposed model expects to be applied to multimedia teaching and law popularization activities and provides some theoretical reference and practical value for improving the effectiveness of online teaching.
            
            
              Findings
              The experimental results show that in the learner behavior detection process of M-learning-oriented online legality education, the model's accuracy can reach 99.8\%. The response time is shorter than other algorithms. Overall, the application effect of the proposed model and algorithm is good and can be applied in practice.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              The research results may lack universality due to the selected research methods. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed methods further. In the future, it is necessary to expand the type and scale of text data to improve the accuracy of data detection.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The research results provide a specific theoretical reference and practical significance for improving the learning effect of online M-learning-oriented legality education.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper meets the needs of mobile learner behavior analysis based on social media.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Fertilizer is one of the most important production factors in the world of agriculture. It is crucial to increase the capacity of technology related to fertilizers. Analysis of patent documents can be one way to analyze technological developments, especially fertilizers.
Data Collection Methods. The data used in this research are metadata, especially the title and abstract of a patent document in Indonesia. With the keyword "fertilizer," Patent metadata was processed in the 1945-2017 period.
Data Analysis. The LDA model can provide a reasonable interpretation regarding topic modeling based on text data.
Results and Discussion. The results find that degree of the patent title is better than the abstract of the patent. The LDA approach can adequately separate the topics of fertilizer patent technology so that it does not have multiple interpretations. 
Conclusion. Based on the findings, there are nine essential topics in the development of fertilizer technology. There is a phenomenon of the lack of technology collaboration between IPC technology sections.},

@article{pal_2021_blockchain_technology_in_financial_services_a_comprehensive_review_of_the_literature,
	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this study is to thoroughly review studies that have used blockchain technology in financial services. This study will help provide a holistic framework that would highlight the current state and challenges of the blockchain in the financial services sector.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The objective of this study is to systematically examine and organize the current body of research literature that either quantitatively or qualitatively explored the use of blockchain technology in financial services. The study uses PRISMA-guided systematic review along with bibliometric analysis to achieve the purpose.
            
            
              Findings
              This study contributes to the existing literature by exploring and analyzing systematic studies available on blockchain with special reference to financial services sector. With blockchain based on five principles, namely, computational logic, peer-to-peer transmission, irreversibility of records, distributed database and transparency with pseudonym has immense potential to unleash and transform the financial service industry. With increasing blockchain-based operations of decentralized banking, insurance, trade finance, financial markets and cryptocurrency market, the subject is rapidly growing and seeking considerable contribution from scholars from around the world.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              This study uses systematic literature review approach, which has its own demerits. Like other studies based on Systematic Literature Review, this study also suffers from a certain bias such as sample selection bias, publication bias, data interpretation and the combination of quantitative and qualitative studies in the population. Further, the adoption and resultant benefits of blockchain have not been empirically tested.
            
            
              Practical implications
              This study can help policymakers and institutions in determining their future course of action, as it highlights the state of research in the area of blockchain technology and financial services.

@article{tang_2021_research_on_automatic_labeling_of_imbalanced_texts_of_customer_complaints_based_on_text_enhancement_and_layer_by_layer_semantic_matching,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Due to its potential impact on business efficiency, automated customer complaint labeling and classification are of great importance for management decision making and business applications. The majority of the current research on automated labeling uses large and well-balanced datasets. However, customer complaint labels are hierarchical in structure, with many labels at the lowest hierarchy level. Relying on lower-level labels leads to small and imbalanced samples, thus rendering the current automatic labeling practices inapplicable to customer complaints. This article proposes an automatic labeling model incorporating the BERT and word2vec methods. The model is validated on electric utility customer complaint data. Within the model, the BERT method serves to obtain shallow text tags. Furthermore, text enhancement is used to mitigate the problem of imbalanced samples that emerge when the number of labels is large. Finally, the word2vec model is utilized for deep text analysis. Experiments demonstrate the proposed model's efficiency in automating customer complaint labeling. Consequently, the proposed model supports enterprises in improving their service quality while simultaneously reducing labor costs.},

@article{wang_2020_the_effect_of_online_investor_sentiment_on_stock_movements_an_lstm_approach,
	abstract = {With more and more investors exerting their voices through network forums or social media platforms, the relationships between online investor sentiment and stock movements have drawn more and more attention. In this paper, we crawl stock comments from China's most popular online stock forum, East Money (www.eastmoney.com), and then develop a sentiment classifier using the LSTM method. Using the online investor sentiment of the stock forum, we explore the effect of online investor sentiment on the stock movements of CSI300. The results show that online investor sentiment has a significant positive impact on both stock return and trading volume and remains significant after controlling book-to-market ratio, BETA, and market value. Moreover, investor sentiment has a significant positive impact on order imbalance of big trade, which represents the main flow of money in the market. As a result, investor sentiment has a positive impact on the major fund flows in the market. In other words, an increase in investor sentiment can boost the major money flows in the market to some extent. From a practical point of view, investor sentiment can assist investors to make investment decisions and help the government to regulate the stock market.},

	abstract = {Metadata files help user find relevant information, provides digital identification, archives and conserves stored files so that they are easily found and reused. The large number of data files on the storage media often makes the user unaware of the duplication and redundancy of the files that have an impact on the waste of storage media space, affecting the speed of a computer in the indexing process, finding or backing up data. This study employ the Latent Semantic Analysis method to detect file duplication and analyze the metadata of various file types in storage media. The findings showed that Latent Semantic Analysis method is able to detect duplicate file metadata in various types of storage media thereby further increasing the usability and speed of access of the data storage media.},

In this study, students' textual peer feedback on video recordings of their teaching practice was analysed to determine the growth of their expertise in relation to blended curriculum design. The degree to which curriculum and literature influenced their feedback was assessed by semantic network analysis of prominent words from the literature that was studied, as well as the lexical richness and semantic cohesion of students' peer feedback and reflections. The lexical richness and the semantic cohesion increased significantly by the end of the semester. This means that students incorporated new vocabulary and maintained semantic consistency while using the new words. Regarding the semantic network analysis, we found stronger connections between the topics being discussed by the students at the end of the semester. Active use of video and peer feedback enhances students' active knowledge base, thus furthering effective teaching.},

@article{gao_2021_characteristics_of_and_user_engagement_with_antivaping_posts_on_instagram_observational_study,
	abstract = {Background
              Although government agencies acknowledge that messages about the adverse health effects of e-cigarette use should be promoted on social media, effectively delivering those health messages is challenging. Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms among US youth and young adults, and it has been used to educate the public about the potential harm of vaping through antivaping posts.
            
            
              Objective
              We aim to analyze the characteristics of and user engagement with antivaping posts on Instagram to inform future message development and information delivery.
            
            
              Methods
              A total of 11,322 Instagram posts were collected from November 18, 2019, to January 2, 2020, by using antivaping hashtags including \#novape, \#novaping, \#stopvaping, \#dontvape, \#antivaping, \#quitvaping, \#antivape, \#stopjuuling, \#dontvapeonthepizza, and \#escapethevape. Among those posts, 1025 posts were randomly selected and 500 antivaping posts were further identified by hand coding. The image type, image content, and account type of antivaping posts were hand coded, the text information in the caption was explored by topic modeling, and the user engagement of each category was compared.
            
            
              Results
              Analyses found that antivaping images of the educational/warning type were the most common (253/500; 50.6\%). The average likes of the educational/warning type (15 likes/post) were significantly lower than the catchphrase image type (these emphasized a slogan such as ``athletesdontvape'' in the image; 32.5 likes/post; P{\textless}.001). The majority of the antivaping posts contained the image content element text (n=332, 66.4\%), followed by the image content element people/person (n=110, 22\%). The images containing people/person elements (32.8 likes/post) had more likes than the images containing other elements (13.8-21.1 likes/post). The captions of the antivaping Instagram posts covered topics including ``lung health,'' ``teen vaping,'' ``stop vaping,'' and ``vaping death cases.'' Among the 500 antivaping Instagram posts, while most posts were from the antivaping community (n=177, 35.4\%) and personal account types (n=182, 36.4\%), the antivaping community account type had the highest average number of posts (1.69 posts/account). However, there was no difference in the number of likes among different account types.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Multiple features of antivaping Instagram posts may be related to user engagement and perception. This study identified the critical elements associated with high user engagement, which could be used to design antivaping posts to deliver health-related information more efficiently.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
            Previous studies indicated electronic cigarette users might be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infections and could develop more severe symptoms once contracted COVID-19 due to their impaired immune responses to virus infections. Social media has been widely used to express users' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
          
          
            OBJECTIVE
            We aimed to examine the responses of electronic cigarette Twitter users to the COVID-19 pandemic using Twitter data.
          
          
            METHODS
            The COVID-19 dataset contained COVID-19-related Twitter posts (tweets) between March 5th, 2020 and April 3rd, 2020. Ecig group included Twitter users who didn't have commercial accounts but ever retweeted e-cigarette promotion posts between May 2019 and August 2019. Twitter users who didn't post or retweet any e-cigarette-related tweets were defined as Non-Ecig group. Sentiment analysis was conducted to compare sentiment scores towards the COVID-19 pandemic between both groups. Topic modeling was used to compare the main topics discussed between the two groups.
          
          
            RESULTS
            The US COVID-19 dataset consisted of 1,112,558 COVID-19-related tweets from 15,657 unique Twitter users in the Ecig group and 9,789,584 COVID-19-related tweets from 2,128,942 unique Twitter users in the Non-Ecig group. Sentiment analysis showed that the Ecig group have more negative sentiment scores than the Non-Ecig group. Results from topic modeling indicated the Ecig group had more concern about COVID-19 related death, while the Non-Ecig group cared more about the government's responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS
            Electronic cigarette Twitter users has more concern towards the COVID-19 pandemic. Twitter is a useful tool to timely monitor public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {The rise of cyberbullying has been of great concern for the general public. This study aims to explore public attitudes towards cyberbullying on Chinese social media. Cognition and emotion are important components of attitude, and this study innovatively used text analysis to extract the cognition and emotion of the posts. We used a web crawler to collect 53,526 posts related to cyberbullying in Chinese on Sina Weibo in a month, where emotions were detected using the software ``Text Mind'', a Chinese linguistic psychological text analysis system, and the content analysis was performed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model. Sentiment analysis showed the frequency of negative emotion words was the highest in the posts; the frequency of anger, anxiety, and sadness words decreased in turn. The topic model analysis identified three common topics about cyberbullying: critiques on cyberbullying and support for its victims, rational expressions of anger and celebrity worship, and calls for further control. In summary, this study quantitatively reveals the negative attitudes of the Chinese public toward cyberbullying and conveys specific public concerns via three common topics. This will help us to better understand the demands of the Chinese public so that targeted support can be proposed to curb cyberbullying.},

@article{rudiger_2022_topic_modeling_revisited_new_evidence_on_algorithm_performance_and_quality_metrics,
	abstract = {Topic modeling is a popular technique for exploring large document collections. It has proven useful for this task, but its application poses a number of challenges. First, the comparison of available algorithms is anything but simple, as researchers use many different datasets and criteria for their evaluation. A second challenge is the choice of a suitable metric for evaluating the calculated results. The metrics used so far provide a mixed picture, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of topic modeling outputs. Altogether, the choice of an appropriate algorithm and the evaluation of the results remain unresolved issues. Although many studies have reported promising performance by various topic models, prior research has not yet systematically investigated the validity of the outcomes in a comprehensive manner, that is, using more than a small number of the available algorithms and metrics. Consequently, our study has two main objectives. First, we compare all commonly used, non-application-specific topic modeling algorithms and assess their relative performance. The comparison is made against a known clustering and thus enables an unbiased evaluation of results. Our findings show a clear ranking of the algorithms in terms of accuracy. Secondly, we analyze the relationship between existing metrics and the known clustering, and thus objectively determine under what conditions these algorithms may be utilized effectively. This way, we enable readers to gain a deeper understanding of the performance of topic modeling techniques and the interplay of performance and evaluation metrics.},

@article{gao_2021_electronic_cigarette_users_perspective_on_the_covid_19_pandemic_observational_study_using_twitter_data,
	abstract = {Background
              Previous studies have shown that electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) users might be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and could develop more severe symptoms if they contract the disease owing to their impaired immune responses to viral infections. Social media platforms such as Twitter have been widely used by individuals worldwide to express their responses to the current COVID-19 pandemic.
            
            
              Objective
              In this study, we aimed to examine the longitudinal changes in the attitudes of Twitter users who used e-cigarettes toward the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as compare differences in attitudes between e-cigarette users and nonusers based on Twitter data.
            
            
              Methods
              The study dataset containing COVID-19--related Twitter posts (tweets) posted between March 5 and April 3, 2020, was collected using a Twitter streaming application programming interface with COVID-19--related keywords. Twitter users were classified into two groups: Ecig group, including users who did not have commercial accounts but posted e-cigarette--related tweets between May 2019 and August 2019, and non-Ecig group, including users who did not post any e-cigarette--related tweets. Sentiment analysis was performed to compare sentiment scores towards the COVID-19 pandemic between both groups and determine whether the sentiment expressed was positive, negative, or neutral. Topic modeling was performed to compare the main topics discussed between the groups.
            
            
              Results
              The US COVID-19 dataset consisted of 4,500,248 COVID-19--related tweets collected from 187,399 unique Twitter users in the Ecig group and 11,479,773 COVID-19--related tweets collected from 2,511,659 unique Twitter users in the non-Ecig group. Sentiment analysis showed that Ecig group users had more negative sentiment scores than non-Ecig group users. Results from topic modeling indicated that Ecig group users had more concerns about deaths due to COVID-19, whereas non-Ecig group users cared more about the government's responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings show that Twitter users who tweeted about e-cigarettes had more concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings can inform public health practitioners to use social media platforms such as Twitter for timely monitoring of public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and educating and encouraging current e-cigarette users to quit vaping to minimize the risks associated with COVID-19.},

@article{gao_2022_investigating_the_impact_of_the_new_york_state_flavor_ban_on_e_cigarette__related_discussions_on_twitter_observational_study,
	abstract = {Background
              On May 18, 2020, the New York State Department of Health implemented a statewide flavor ban to prohibit the sales of all flavored vapor products, except for tobacco or any other authorized flavor.
            
            
              Objective
              This study aims to investigate the discussion changes in e-cigarette--related tweets over time with the implementation of the New York State flavor ban.
            
            
              Methods
              Through the Twitter streaming application programming interface, 59,883 e-cigarette--related tweets were collected within the New York State from February 6, 2020, to May 17, 2020 (period 1, before the implementation of the flavor ban), May 18, 2020-June 30, 2020 (period 2, between the implementation of the flavor ban and the online sales ban), July 1, 2020-September 15, 2020 (period 3, the short term after the online sales ban), and September 16, 2020-November 30, 2020 (period 4, the long term after the online sales ban). Sentiment analysis and topic modeling were conducted to investigate the changes in public attitudes and discussions in e-cigarette--related tweets. The popularity of different e-cigarette flavor categories was compared before and after the implementation of the New York State flavor ban.
            
            
              Results
              Our results showed that the proportion of e-cigarette--related tweets with negative sentiment significantly decreased (4305/13,246, 32.5\% vs 3855/14,455, 26.67\%, P{\textless}.001), and tweets with positive sentiment significantly increased (5246/13,246, 39.6\% vs 7038/14,455, 48.69\%, P{\textless}.001) in period 4 compared to period 3. ``Teens and nicotine products'' was the most frequently discussed e-cigarette--related topic in the negative tweets. In contrast, ``nicotine products and quitting'' was more prevalent in positive tweets. The proportion of tweets mentioning mint and menthol flavors significantly increased right after the flavor ban and decreased to lower levels over time. The proportions of fruit and sweet flavors were most frequently mentioned in period 1, decreased in period 2, and dominated again in period 4.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The proportion of e-cigarette--related tweets with different attitudes and frequently discussed flavor categories changed over time after the implementation of the New York State ban of flavored vaping products. This change indicated a potential impact of the flavor ban on public discussions of flavored e-cigarettes.},

@article{yakunin_2021_kaznewsdataset_single_country_overall_digital_mass_media_publication_corpus,
	abstract = {Mass media is one of the most important elements influencing the information environment of society. The mass media is not only a source of information about what is happening but is often the authority that shapes the information agenda, the boundaries, and forms of discussion on socially relevant topics. A multifaceted and, where possible, quantitative assessment of mass media performance is crucial for understanding their objectivity, tone, thematic focus and, quality. The paper presents a corpus of Kazakhstan media, which contains over 4 million publications from 36 primary sources (which has at least 500 publications). The corpus also includes more than 2 million texts of Russian media for comparative analysis of publication activity of the countries, also about 4000 sections of state policy documents. The paper briefly describes the natural language processing and multiple-criteria decision-making methods, which are the algorithmic basis of the text and mass media evaluation method, and describes the results of several research cases, such as identification of propaganda, assessment of the tone of publications, calculation of the level of socially relevant negativity, comparative analysis of publication activity in the field of renewable energy. Experiments confirm the general possibility of evaluating the socially significant news, identifying texts with propagandistic content, evaluating the sentiment of publications using the topic model of the text corpus since the area under receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC AUC) values of 0.81, 0.73 and 0.93 were achieved on abovementioned tasks. The described cases do not exhaust the possibilities of thematic, tonal, dynamic, etc., analysis of the considered corpus of texts. The corpus will be interesting to researchers considering both multiple publications and mass media analysis, including comparative analysis and identification of common patterns inherent in the media of different countries.},

	abstract = {Topic models are widely used in building clusters of documents for more than a decade, yet problems occurring in choosing the optimal number of topics. The main problem is the lack of a stable metric of the quality of topics obtained during the construction of topic models. The authors analyzed from previous works, most of the models used in determining the number of topics are non-parametric and the quality of topics determined by using perplexity and coherence measures and concluded that they are not applicable in solving this problem. In this paper, we used the parametric method, which is an extension of the traditional topic model with visual access tendency for visualization of the number of topics (clusters) to complement clustering and to choose the optimal number of topics based on results of cluster validity indices. Developed hybrid topic models are demonstrated with different Twitter datasets on various topics in obtaining the optimal number of topics and in measuring the quality of clusters. The experimental results showed that the Visual Non-negative Matrix Factorization (VNMF) topic model performs well in determining the optimal number of topics with interactive visualization and in performance measure of the quality of clusters with validity indices.},

@techreport{gao_2021_characteristics_of_and_user_engagement_with_antivaping_posts_on_instagram_observational_study_preprint,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND
            Although government agencies acknowledge that messages about the adverse health effects of e-cigarette use should be promoted on social media, effectively delivering those health messages is challenging. Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms among US youth and young adults, and it has been used to educate the public about the potential harm of vaping through antivaping posts.
          
          
            OBJECTIVE
            We aim to analyze the characteristics of and user engagement with antivaping posts on Instagram to inform future message development and information delivery.
          
          
            METHODS
            A total of 11,322 Instagram posts were collected from November 18, 2019, to January 2, 2020, by using antivaping hashtags including \#novape, \#novaping, \#stopvaping, \#dontvape, \#antivaping, \#quitvaping, \#antivape, \#stopjuuling, \#dontvapeonthepizza, and \#escapethevape. Among those posts, 1025 posts were randomly selected and 500 antivaping posts were further identified by hand coding. The image type, image content, and account type of antivaping posts were hand coded, the text information in the caption was explored by topic modeling, and the user engagement of each category was compared.
          
          
            RESULTS
            Analyses found that antivaping images of the \textit{educational/warning} type were the most common (253/500; 50.6\%). The average likes of the \textit{educational/warning} type (15 likes/post) were significantly lower than the \textit{catchphrase} image type (these emphasized a slogan such as ``athletesdontvape'' in the image; 32.5 likes/post; \textit{P}\&lt;.001). The majority of the antivaping posts contained the image content element \textit{text} (n=332, 66.4\%), followed by the image content element \textit{people/person} (n=110, 22\%). The images containing \textit{people/person} elements (32.8 likes/post) had more likes than the images containing other elements (13.8-21.1 likes/post). The captions of the antivaping Instagram posts covered topics including ``lung health,'' ``teen vaping,'' ``stop vaping,'' and ``vaping death cases.'' Among the 500 antivaping Instagram posts, while most posts were from the \textit{antivaping community} (n=177, 35.4\%) and \textit{personal} account types (n=182, 36.4\%), the \textit{antivaping community} account type had the highest average number of posts (1.69 posts/account). However, there was no difference in the number of likes among different account types.
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS
            Multiple features of antivaping Instagram posts may be related to user engagement and perception. This study identified the critical elements associated with high user engagement, which could be used to design antivaping posts to deliver health-related information more efficiently.},

To carry out the empirical study, we obtained the information available on TripAdvisor about airlines in Europe, the USA, Canada, and other countries in America, differentiating also between airlines that follow a low-cost strategy and those that do not apply it. The results show that there is a significant difference in key service quality variables between airlines in the different geographical areas studied on the one hand, and the low-cost strategy applied on the other. The variables to be used to conduct the positioning analysis in the airlines are determined. They also show that the methodology has relevant practical implications and provides tools to further develop research related to the online reputation and strategic positioning of airlines.},

@article{amat_lefort_2022_quality_40_big_data_analytics_to_explore_service_quality_attributes_and_their_relation_to_user_sentiment_in_airbnb_reviews,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Quality 4.0 is a new paradigm of quality management, which emphasises the need to adapt to recent technological innovations by updating traditional quality approaches. Amongst the most important factors for adopting Quality 4.0 is the leveraging of big data to collect insights and quality perceptions from clients. Therefore, user reviews have emerged as a valuable source of information, which can be analysed through machine learning procedures to uncover latent quality dimensions.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study applies a combination of text mining techniques to analyse Airbnb reviews, identifying service quality attributes and assessing their relation to the users' sentiment. More than two million reviews written by guests in four European cities are analysed. First, topic modelling is applied to find the quality attributes mentioned by reviewers. Then, sentiment analysis is used to assess the positiveness/negativeness of the users' feedback.
            
            
              Findings
              A total of 37 quality attributes are identified. Four of them show a significant positive relation to the guest's sentiment: apartment views, host tips and advice, location and host friendliness. On the other hand, the following attributes are negatively correlated with user sentiment: sleep disturbance, website responsiveness, thermal management and hygiene issues.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper provides a practical example of how Quality 4.0 can be implemented, proposing a data-driven methodology to extract service quality attributes from user-generated content. Additionally, several attributes that had not appeared in existing Airbnb studies are identified, which can serve as a reference to extend previous quality assessment scales.},

@article{yin_2022_exploring_the_factors_associated_with_mental_health_attitude_in_china_a_structural_topic_modeling_approach,
	abstract = {Mental health attitude has huge impacts on the improvement of mental health. In response to the ongoing damage the COVID-19 pandemic caused to the mental health of the Chinese people, this study aims to explore the factors associated with mental health attitude in China. To this end, we extract the key topics in mental health-related microblogs on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, using the structural topic modeling (STM) approach. An interaction term of sentiment polarity and time is put into the STM model to track the evolution of public sentiment towards the key topics over time. Through an in-depth analysis of 146,625 Weibo posts, this study captures 12 topics that are, in turn, classified into four factors as stigma (n = 54,559, 37.21\%), mental health literacy (n = 32,199, 21.96\%), public promotion (n = 30,747, 20.97\%), and social support (n = 29,120, 19.86\%). The results show that stigma is the primary factor inducing negative mental health attitudes in China as none of the topics related to this factor are considered positive. Mental health literacy, public promotion, and social support are the factors that could enhance positive attitudes towards mental health, since most of the topics related to these factors are identified as positive ones. The provision of tailored strategies for each of these factors could potentially improve the mental health attitudes of the Chinese people.},

@article{tian_2022_exploring_public_attitudes_toward_live_streaming_fitness_in_china_a_sentiment_and_content_analysis_of_chinas_social_media_weibo,
	abstract = {Objectives
              Live-streaming fitness is perceived by the Chinese government as an invaluable means to reduce the prevalence of physical inactivity amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate the public altitudes of the Chinese people toward live-streaming fitness and provide future health communication strategies on the public promotion of live-streaming fitness accordingly.
            
            
              Methods
              This study collected live-streaming fitness-related microblog posts from July 2021 to June 2022 in Weibo, the Chinese equivalent to Twitter. We used the BiLSTM-CNN model to carry out the sentiment analysis, and the structured topic modeling (STM) method to conduct content analysis.
            
            
              Results
              This study extracted 114,397 live-streaming fitness-related Weibo posts. Over 80\% of the Weibo posts were positive during the period of the study, and over 85\% were positive in half of the period. This study finds 8 topics through content analysis, which are fitness during quarantine; cost reduction; online community; celebrity effect; Industry; fitness injuries; live commerce and Zero Covid strategy.
            
            
              Conclusions
              It is discovered that the public attitudes toward live-streaming fitness were largely positive. Topics related to celebrity effect (5--11\%), fitness injuries (8--16\%), live commerce (5--9\%) and Zero Covid strategy (16--26\%) showed upward trends in negative views of the Chinese people. Specific health communication strategy suggestions are given to target each of the negative topics.},

@article{joung_2021_data_driven_approach_to_dual_service_failure_monitoring_from_negative_online_reviews_managerial_perspective,
	abstract = {Monitoring of dual service failures (e.g., trends in service failures and consecutive service failures) in business is emphasized for service quality management. Previous studies analyzing negative online reviews to conduct dual service failure monitoring from a managerial perspective are scarce. Numerous negative online reviews are useful sources for dual service failure monitoring because they can be easily collected at a low cost. This article proposes a data-driven approach to monitor service failure trends and consecutive service failures from negative online reviews. In the proposed approach, first a classifier is developed to categorize newly collected negative reviews into service failures by Latent Dirichlet allocation. Subsequently, a threshold value is provided to identify a new type of service failure, which was not achieved previously using a control chart. Finally, the probability of consecutive service failures is obtained by association rule mining. A case study of Uber is conducted to validate the proposed approach. The results exhibit that the proposed approach can perform dual service failure monitoring. This study can increase marketing intelligence for dynamic management of service failure and allow rapid responses to service failures.},

@article{saydam_2022_passengers_service_perceptions_emerging_from_user_generated_content_during_the_pandemic_the_case_of_leading_low_cost_carriers,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Although a vast amount of research has been started to gauge customer satisfaction using surveys, the influence of COVID-19 on passengers' satisfaction has not received enough attention. Hence, the primary purpose of this research is to determine the dominant themes that emerged from airline travelers' online reviews and to determine attributes that are pertinent to the satisfaction of passengers flying with low-cost carriers (LCC) during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, this study investigates whether the salient themes of passengers' overall experiences vary by traveler origin, which may give more insight into airline sector market segmentation.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Leximancer software was used to construct concepts from words, followed by themes in the data analysis.
            
            
              Findings
              The analyses revealed eight themes in descriptions of ``travel experiences'' for airline passengers. These are ``flights,'' ``staff,'' ``service,'' ``hygiene,'' ``cancellations,'' ``legroom,'' ``COVID-19'' and ``test''. Negative reviews associated with ``cancellations,'' ``refund,'' ``waiting'' and ``baggage'' (handling) concepts.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The findings provide important information about airline passengers' overall experiences. Limited studies have comprehensively considered various satisfaction categories of airline travelers using online reviews.},

@article{celuch_2020_customers_experience_of_purchasing_event_tickets_mining_online_reviews_based_on_topic_modeling_and_sentiment_analysis,
	abstract = {Purpose
              In search of creating an extraordinary experience for customers, services have gone beyond the means of a transaction between buyers and sellers. In the event industry, where purchasing tickets online is a common procedure, it remains unclear as to how to enhance the multifaceted experience. This study aims at offering a snapshot into the most valued aspects for consumers and to uncover consumers' feelings toward their experience of purchasing event tickets on third-party ticketing platforms.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This is a cross-disciplinary study that applies knowledge from both data science and services marketing. Under the guise of natural language processing, latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling and sentiment analysis were used to interpret the embedded meanings based on online reviews.
            
            
              Findings
              The findings conceptualized ten dimensions valued by eventgoers, including technical issues, value of core product and service, word-of-mouth, trustworthiness, professionalism and knowledgeability, customer support, information transparency, additional fee, prior experience and after-sales service. Among these aspects, consumers rated the value of the core product and service to be the most positive experience, whereas the additional fee was considered the least positive one.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Drawing from the intersection of natural language processing and the status quo of the event industry, this study offers a better understanding of eventgoers' experiences in the case of purchasing online event tickets. It also provides a hands-on guide for marketers to stage memorable experiences in the era of digitalization.},

@article{leem_2021_using_text_mining_to_measure_mobile_banking_service_quality,
	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this study is to propose a method of measuring service quality as well as suggesting to detect customer complaints through analysis of customer online reviews of mobile bank, which is unstructured data.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study uses text mining approach for customer online reviews analysis. The research procedure includes: (1) extracting users' reviews for Kakao Mobile Bank, (2) pre-processing of the extracted review data, (3) analyzing the sentiment of each review, (4) measuring the service quality score of each dimension by analyzing keyword frequency and network for each polarity, (5) evaluating total score for mobile bank service quality, and (6) detecting customer complaints on online reviews.
            
            
              Findings
              There are some findings. First, from the customer's point of view, it was possible to see which factors are important among the various dimensions of service quality and which factors should be managed well in mobile banking setting. Second, by periodically finding customer complaints, service failures can be prevented early, and service quality and customer satisfaction can be improved.
            
            
              Practical implications
              From a practical point of view, mobile bank managers should pay more attention to the service quality dimensions of practicality and enjoyment. In addition, the results mean that the app design and aesthetics with the most negative reviews should be reviewed from the user's perspective rather than from the company's point of view. Second, it is possible for them to establish a systematic complaint management system that can prevent service failure in advance by detecting customer complaints early. Third, it is possible for them to make quick decisions regarding service quality with the help of real-time customer response through dashboard construction.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper is a pioneer study measuring service quality with sentiment analysis, one of the text mining applications, using customers' reviews of a mobile bank.},

Our data include historical online reviews, names of reviewers, ratings, location, helpful votes, date of visits, and contributions. In terms of results, the study found 30 key topics related to tourist satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Additionally, we found three clusters (i.e., holiday experience, attractions and facilities, and food experience). Lastly, we that suggested rating levels are different based on the type of tourists (i.e., domestic and international). This study provides discussions and implications for tourism research and industry practices.},

@article{zaki_ahmed_2020_significant_labels_in_sentiment_analysis_of_online_customer_reviews_of_airlines,
	abstract = {Sentiment analysis is becoming an essential tool for analyzing the contents of online customer reviews. This analysis involves identifying the necessary labels to determine whether a comment is positive, negative, or neutral, and the intensity with which the customer's sentiment is expressed. Based on this information, service companies such as airlines can design and implement a communication strategy to improve their customers' image of the company and the service received. This study proposes a methodology to identify the significant labels that represent the customers' sentiments, based on a quantitative variable, that is, the overall rating. The key labels were identified in the comments' titles, which usually include the words that best define the customer experience. This database was applied to more extensive online customer reviews in order to validate that the identified tags are meaningful for assessing the sentiments expressed in them. The results show that the labels elaborated from the titles are valid for analyzing the feelings in the comments, thus, simplifying the labels to be taken into account when carrying out a sentiment analysis of customers' online comments.},

Customer satisfaction has always been one of the key factors for the sustainable development of enterprises. However, in the fast-food restaurant business, gaining the knowledge of customer satisfaction is one of the critical tasks. Moreover, text reviews in social media have become one of important reference sources for customers' decisions in buying services and products. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to explore whether customer voices from social media reviews are different during the COVID-19 outbreak and to propose a new method to reduce interpersonal contact when collecting data. A text mining scheme which includes least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and decision trees (DT) are presented to discover the essential factors for customers to increase their satisfaction from unstructured online customer reviews. Finally, three real world review sets were employed to validate the effectiveness of the presented text mining scheme. Experimental results can help companies to properly adapt to similar epidemic situations in the future and facilitate their sustainable development.},

@article{shadrova_2021_topic_models_do_not_model_topics_epistemological_remarks_and_steps_towards_best_practices,
	abstract = {The social sciences and digital humanities have recently adopted the machine learning technique of topic modeling to address research questions in their fields. This is problematic in a number of ways, some of which have not received much attention in the debate yet. This paper adds epistemological concerns centering around the interface between topic modeling and linguistic concepts and the argumentative embedding of evidence obtained through topic modeling. It concludes that topic modeling in its present state of methodological integration does not meet the requirements of an independent research method. It operates from relevantly unrealistic assumptions, is non-deterministic, cannot effectively be validated against a reasonable number of competing models, does not lock into a well-defined linguistic interface, and does not scholarly model topics in the sense of themes or content. These features are intrinsic and make the interpretation of its results prone to apophenia (the human tendency to perceive random sets of elements as meaningful patterns) and confirmation bias (the human tendency to perceptually prefer patterns that are in alignment with pre-existing biases). While partial validation of the statistical model is possible, a conceptual validation would require an extended triangulation with other methods and human ratings, and clarification of whether statistical distinctivity of lexical co-occurrence correlates with conceputal topics in any reliable way.},

It is a form of text-based communication that provides new possibilities and opens vast perspectives in terms of marketing. Reading consumer reviews gives marketers an opportunity to eavesdrop on their own consumers. This paper examines consumer reviews of three different competitive automobile brands and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of each vehicle using text mining and association rule methods. The data were collected from an online resource for automotive information, Edmunds.com, with a scraping tool ``ParseHub'' and then processed in R software for statistical computing and graphics. The paper provides detailed insights into the superior and problematic sides of each brand and into consumers' perceptions of automobiles and highlights differences between satisfied and unsatisfied groups regarding the best and worst features of the brands.},

@article{mauro_2020_service_aware_interactive_presentation_of_items_for_decision_making,
	abstract = {Current information exploration models present low-level features or technical aspects related to the paradigm used to generate results. While this may increase transparency, it does not help the user form a personal opinion about items because it does not describe the overall experience with them. In order to address this issue, we propose the INTERactivE viSualizaTion model (INTEREST) that supports the exploration and analysis of search results by means of a graphical representation of consumer feedback aimed at making the user aware of the service properties in all the stages of fruition, focusing on the data that is most relevant to her/him. INTEREST is based on the Service Journey Maps for the design and description of user experience with services. We applied it to the home booking domain by developing the Apartment Monitoring application that supports overviewing and analyzing online reviews about rented homes. In a user study, we compared the decision-making support provided by our application with that of a baseline model that enables a temporal filtering of consumer feedback. We found out that Apartment Monitoring outperforms the baseline in user experience, user awareness of item properties, and user control during the interaction with the system. In particular, according to the participants of the study, Apartment Monitoring describes the expectations about the homes and it supports their selection in a more effective way than the baseline. These findings encourage moving from a low-level description of item properties to a service-oriented one in order to improve users' decision-making capabilities.},

@article{tian_2019_a_new_approach_of_social_media_analytics_to_predict_service_quality_evidence_from_the_airline_industry,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Research on how to use social media data to measure and evaluate service quality is still limited. To fill the research gap in the literature, the purpose of this paper is to open a new avenue for future work to measure the service quality in the service industry by developing a new analytical approach of using social media analytics to evaluate service quality.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This paper uses social media data to measure the service quality of the airline industry with the SERVQUAL metrics. A novel benchmark data set was created for each SERVQUAL metric. The data set was analyzed through text mining and sentiment analysis.
            
            
              Findings
              By comparing the results from social media with official service quality report from the Department of Transportation, the authors found that the proposed service quality metrics from social media are valid and can be used to estimate the service quality.
            
            
              Practical implications
              This paper presents service quality metrics and a methodology that can be easily adopted by other businesses to assess service quality. This study also provides guidance and suggestions to help businesses understand how to collect and analyze social media data for the purpose of evaluating service quality.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper offers a novel methodology that uses text mining and sentiment analysis to help the airline industry assess its service quality.},

@article{zaki_ahmed_2022_a_methodology_for_machine_learning_content_analysis_to_define_the_key_labels_in_the_titles_of_online_customer_reviews_with_the_rating_evaluation,
	abstract = {Online reputation is of great strategic importance to companies today. Customers share their emotions and experiences about the service received or the product acquired through online opinions in the form of quantitative variables or text comments. Although quantitative variables can be analyzed using different statistical methods, the main limitation of comment content analysis lies in the statistical analysis because the texts are qualitative. This study proposes and applies a methodology to develop a machine learning designed to identify the key labels related to the quantitative variables in the general rating of the service received from an airline. To this end, we create a quantitative dichotomous variable from zero to one from a database of comment title labels, thus facilitating the conversion of titles into quantitative variables. On this basis, we carry out a multiple regression analysis where the dependent variable is the overall rating and the independent variables are the labels. The results obtained are satisfactory, and the significant labels are determined, as well as their signs and coefficients with the general ratings. Findings show that the significant labels detected in titles positively influence the prediction of the overall rating of airline. This paper is a new approach to applying cluster analysis to the text content of customers' online reviews in an airline. Thus, the proposed methodology results in a quantitative value for the labels that determines the direction and intensity of customers' opinions. Moreover, it has important practical implications for managers to identify the weakness and the strengths of their services in order to increase their positioning in the market by developing meaningful strategies.},

@article{ismael_2020_the_impact_of_job_satisfaction_on_turnover_rate_in_the_contact_center_environment_in_the_jordanian_labor_market,
	abstract = {The Jordanian economy is declining due to the political and economic conditions in the region, which caused more scarcity of resources and lowering the investment rate. Therefore, the services sector has become more important in the Jordanian labor market and the Contact Center Environment has become even more important. Yet, one of the most brilliant goals for the Contact Center is to lower the turnover rate and deliver the best service to the clients. This paper measured the impact of job satisfaction on turnover rate in the Contact Center Environment. Service providers at inbound call centers answered the questionnaires designed to measure the impact of their job satisfaction with its elements (social satisfaction, salaries, benefits, career growth and safety, psychological and physical environment) on their intent to turnover. 100 questionnaires were distributed randomly in different Contact Centers in the Jordanian labor market. Sixty-eight respondents were received, and the valid ones for analysis were 58. The research identifies a significant impact of Job safety and career growth as major variables that affect the intention and the turnover rate among employees in the Contact Center.},

This pandemic has changed consumer habits and behaviors significantly, primarily because of confinement-related issues. While numerous research has been undertaken to study customer satisfaction using surveys and online passenger ratings, the effect of COVID-19 on passenger satisfaction has not been explored. It is vital to assess satisfaction indicators gathered from online consumer reviews to ascertain consumers' preferences for airline services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this study is to determine the primary themes that emerged from airline travelers' internet reviews during the COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, it attempts to determine which of these themes relate to higher and lower passenger satisfaction. The article uses qualitative (i.e., narratives) analyses to examine the main components of passengers' subjective experiences of the airline. Data are represented by passenger reviews posted on the TripAdvisor website. The analyses revealed ten themes in descriptions of airline travel experiences. These include ``flight'', ``service'', ``staff'', ``food'', ``check-in'', ``cancellation'', ``COVID-19'', ``airport'', ``class'', and ``luggage''. Dissatisfying concepts are linked with the ``cancellation'', ``check-in'', ``refund'', and ``airport'' concepts.},

	abstract = {Due to the massive number of products being produced every year in every industry, firms have witnessed a tremendous growth in innovation of methods to create a sustainable competitive advantage. For the past decade and with the availability of online consumer reviews, companies and researchers have developed many approaches utilizing electronic Word-of-Mouth to improve and develop products and services to outperform competitors. The purpose of this study is to construct an effective method to perform a better product comparative analysis based on online consumer reviews. We propose a novel framework called Teardown Joint Sentiment-Topic analysis model consisting of a combination of text analytical approaches incorporated with a developed method of the traditional teardown analysis product comparative approach. The proposed approach is fully unsupervised model that employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling to form topics which are classified according to their sentiments. Topics are then analyzed against competitive products and critical topics are identified using a developed teardown method. A case study analyzing online customer reviews of competing products in two domains (i.e., mobile phones and surveillance cameras) is conducted. The identified critical topics are further analyzed in view of products' specifications perspective. We found that the detected aspects of the selected products are indeed critical, and hence, they need to be improved in order to gain a competitive advantage. The significant result of this study shows that the proposed method is effective in conducting products comparative analysis and provides valuable insights into utilizing the consumer reviews for product development.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This study aims to examine the impact of the outsourcing of hotel departments on service quality measured through online customer reviews.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Three models were developed, considering three important online tourism reputation websites, to establish the relationship between the outsourcing of hotel activities and service quality.
            
            
              Findings
              The results show that in the three databases, hotel outsourcing has a negative influence on online reputation. A higher level of outsourcing reduces service quality, the percentage of recommendations and the value perceived by customers who carry out online reviews of these hotels. In addition, different models were established for each type of department.
            
            
              Originality/value
              To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper presents the first empirical study to analyse the relationship between the impact of process outsourcing and customers' online reviews. It is also the first empirical research to consider the relationship between outsourcing and ratings by hotel end-customers as a performance measure.
            
          , 
            
              外包活动对服务质量认知的影响：基于酒店顾客在线评论的实证研究研究目的
              通过分析在线顾客评论, 本研究旨在探索外包酒店部门活动对顾客服务质量的认知影响。
            
            
              研究设计/方法/途径
              为探知外包酒店活动和服务质量之间的关系, 本研究借用了三个重要的旅游在线评论网站建立了三个模型。
            
            
              研究结果
              研究结果表明再三项数据库中, 酒店外包对酒店的在线名声有负面影响。高程度的外包降低顾客对服务质量的评价, 推介率, 以及顾客对酒店的感知价值。此外, 本研究为酒店各项部门都建立了对应的不同模型。
            
            
              研究原创性/价值
              本论文作为对酒店外包活动对顾客在线评论影响的首次实证研究。本研究也是首次探讨外包和顾客评分作为一项绩效指标的研究。},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Selecting the appropriate academic journal is a priority issue for researchers in the process of publishing a manuscript. If researchers could quantify the research topic in terms of its fit with the journal requirements before the submission of a paper, then the assessment of journal suitability could be much easier. Basing any decision on journal impact factors alone might obviously result in a mismatch, eventual rejection and a consequent loss of time. Taking the twelve leading Tourism and Hospitality journals as a reference, the main research topics mentioned in the abstracts of 20,381 articles are identified, using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm and other text-mining techniques running the R programming language. Subsequently, a quantitative measure of the fit of the research topics in each journal is offered according to their frequency of occurrence. The results suggested that the importance of the topic-journal fit with respect to the impact factor depended on the variance of the fits among the journals. Finally, a guide of the most suitable journals for the topics is presented, based on the JCR impact factor and the fit of the topic. Some recommendations are likewise offered on the use of this methodology and its limitations.},

@techreport{wu_2022_a_comparison_of_representation_learning_methods_for_medical_concepts_in_mimic_iv,
	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Objective
            To compare and release the diagnosis (ICD-10-CM), procedure (ICD-10-PCS), and medication (NDC) concept (code) embeddings trained by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT, for more efficient electronic health record (EHR) data analysis.
          
          
            Materials and Methods
            The embeddings were pre-trained by the four aforementioned models separately using the diagnosis, procedure, and medication information in MIMIC-IV. We interpreted the embeddings by visualizing them in 2D space and used the silhouette coefficient to assess the clustering ability of these embeddings. Furthermore, we evaluated the embeddings in three downstream tasks without fine-tuning: next visit diagnoses prediction, ICU patients mortality prediction, and medication recommendation.
          
          
            Results
            We found that embeddings pre-trained by GloVe have the best performance in the downstream tasks and the best interpretability for all diagnosis, procedure, and medication codes. In the next-visit diagnosis prediction, the accuracy of using GloVe embeddings was 12.2\% higher than the baseline, which is the random generator. In the other two prediction tasks, GloVe improved the accuracy by 2\%-3\% over the baseline. LDA, Word2Vec, and BERT marginally improved the results over the baseline in most cases.
          
          
            Discussion and Conclusion
            GloVe shows superiority in mining diagnoses, procedures, and medications information of MIMIC-IV compared with LDA, Word2Vec, and BERT. Besides, we found that the granularity of training samples can affect the performance of models according to the downstream task and pre-train data.},

@techreport{dehler_holland_2021_the_legitimacy_of_wind_power_in_germany,
	abstract = {Legitimacy is a crucial factor determining the success of technologies in the early stages of development and for maintaining resource flows as well as public and political support across the technology life cycle. In sustainability transitions that unfold over long periods of time, the maintenance of legitimacy of technologies identified as vital for sustainability becomes a key challenge. In the energy sector, wind power contributes to the transition to an energy system with low greenhouse gas emissions. In Germany, wind power recently faced a series of lawsuits and decreasing investment activity. Therefore, we assess the legitimacy of wind power in Germany by analyzing newspaper articles from four national newspapers from 2009 to 2018. A large amount of articles motivates the use of topic models and statistical methods to shed light on the changing alignment of wind power with its context. The results show that various issues temporarily gain prominence on the agenda. Lately, the legitimacy of wind power in Germany is increasingly challenged by adverse effects on humans, animals, and landscapes. Policymakers and project developers may address aspects of pragmatic legitimacy, such as civic participation and the local distribution of profits.},

@article{al_tameemi_2022_a_comprehensive_review_of_visual_textual_sentiment_analysis_from_social_media_networks,
	abstract = {Social media networks have become a significant aspect of people's lives, serving as a platform for their ideas, opinions and emotions. Consequently, automated sentiment analysis (SA) is critical for recognising people's feelings in ways that other information sources cannot. The analysis of these feelings revealed various applications, including brand evaluations, YouTube film reviews and healthcare applications. As social media continues to develop, people post a massive amount of information in different forms, including text, photos, audio and video. Thus, traditional SA algorithms have become limited, as they do not consider the expressiveness of other modalities. By including such characteristics from various material sources, these multimodal data streams provide new opportunities for optimising the expected results beyond text-based SA. Our study focuses on the forefront field of multimodal SA, which examines visual and textual data posted on social media networks. Many people are more likely to utilise this information to express themselves on these platforms. To serve as a resource for academics in this rapidly growing field, we introduce a comprehensive overview of textual and visual SA, including data pre-processing, feature extraction techniques, sentiment benchmark datasets, and the efficacy of multiple classification methodologies suited to each field. We also provide a brief introduction of the most frequently utilised data fusion strategies and a summary of existing research on visual-textual SA. Finally, we highlight the most significant challenges and investigate several important sentiment applications.},

@article{mera_gaona_2021_framework_for_the_ensemble_of_feature_selection_methods,
	abstract = {Feature selection (FS) has attracted the attention of many researchers in the last few years due to the increasing sizes of datasets, which contain hundreds or thousands of columns (features). Typically, not all columns represent relevant values. Consequently, the noise or irrelevant columns could confuse the algorithms, leading to a weak performance of machine learning models. Different FS algorithms have been proposed to analyze highly dimensional datasets and determine their subsets of relevant features to overcome this problem. However, very often, FS algorithms are biased by the data. Thus, methods for ensemble feature selection (EFS) algorithms have become an alternative to integrate the advantages of single FS algorithms and compensate for their disadvantages. The objective of this research is to propose a conceptual and implementation framework to understand the main concepts and relationships in the process of aggregating FS algorithms and to demonstrate how to address FS on datasets with high dimensionality. The proposed conceptual framework is validated by deriving an implementation framework, which incorporates a set of Phyton packages with functionalities to support the assembly of feature selection algorithms. The performance of the implementation framework was demonstrated in several experiments discovering relevant features in the Sonar, SPECTF, and WDBC datasets. The experiments contrasted the accuracy of two machine learning classifiers (decision tree and logistic regression), trained with subsets of features generated either by single FS algorithms or the set of features selected by the ensemble feature selection framework. We observed that for the three datasets used (Sonar, SPECTF, and WD), the highest precision percentages (86.95\%, 74.73\%, and 93.85\%, respectively) were obtained when the classifiers were trained with the subset of features generated by our framework. Additionally, the stability of the feature sets generated using our ensemble method was evaluated. The results showed that the method achieved perfect stability for the three datasets used in the evaluation.},

@article{fatima_zahrae_2021_application_of_latent_dirichlet_allocation_lda_for_clustering_financial_tweets,
	abstract = {Sentiment classification is one of the hottest research areas among the Natural Language Processing (NLP) topics. While it aims to detect sentiment polarity and classification of the given opinion, requires a large number of aspect extractions. However, extracting aspect takes human effort and long time. To reduce this, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method have come out recently to deal with this issue.In this paper, an efficient preprocessing method for sentiment classification is presented and will be used for analyzing user's comments on Twitter social network. For this purpose, different text preprocessing techniques have been used on the dataset to achieve an acceptable standard text. Latent Dirichlet Allocation has been applied on the obtained data after this fast and accurate preprocessing phase. The implementation of different sentiment analysis methods and the results of these implementations have been compared and evaluated. The experimental results show that the combined uses of the preprocessing method of this paper and Latent Dirichlet Allocation have an acceptable results compared to other basic methods.},

@article{truica_2021_topic_based_document_level_sentiment_analysis_using_contextual_cues,
	abstract = {Document-level Sentiment Analysis is a complex task that implies the analysis of large textual content that can incorporate multiple contradictory polarities at the phrase and word levels. Most of the current approaches either represent textual data using pre-trained word embeddings without considering the local context that can be extracted from the dataset, or they detect the overall topic polarity without considering both the local and global context. In this paper, we propose a novel document-topic embedding model, DocTopic2Vec, for document-level polarity detection in large texts by employing general and specific contextual cues obtained through the use of document embeddings (Doc2Vec) and Topic Modeling. In our approach, (1) we use a large dataset with game reviews to create different word embeddings by applying Word2Vec, FastText, and GloVe, (2) we create Doc2Vecs enriched with the local context given by the word embeddings for each review, (3) we construct topic embeddings Topic2Vec using three Topic Modeling algorithms, i.e., LDA, NMF, and LSI, to enhance the global context of the Sentiment Analysis task, (4) for each document and its dominant topic, we build the new DocTopic2Vec by concatenating the Doc2Vec with the Topic2Vec created with the same word embedding. We also design six new Convolutional-based (Bidirectional) Recurrent Deep Neural Network Architectures that show promising results for this task. The proposed DocTopic2Vecs are used to benchmark multiple Machine and Deep Learning models, i.e., a Logistic Regression model, used as a baseline, and 18 Deep Neural Networks Architectures. The experimental results show that the new embedding and the new Deep Neural Network Architectures achieve better results than the baseline, i.e., Logistic Regression and Doc2Vec.},

@article{dina_2020_aspect_based_sentiment_analysis_of_employees_review_experience,
	abstract = {Background: Employees of technology companies evaluate their experience through online reviews. Online reviews of companies from employees or former employees help job seeker to find out the weaknesses and strengths of the companies.  The reviews can be used as an evaluation tool for each technology company to understand their employee's perceptions. However, most information on online reviews is not well responded since some of the detailed information of the company is missing. Objective: This study aims to generate an Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis using user review data. The review data were then extracted and classified into five aspects: work balance, culture value, career opportunities, company benefit, and management. The output of this study is the aspect score from each company.Methods: This study suggests a method to analyze online reviews from employees in detail, so it can prevent the missing of specific information. The analysis was sequentially carried out in five stages. First, user review data were crawled from Glassdoor and stored in a database. Second, the raw data were processed in the data pre-processing stage to delete the incomplete data. Third, the words other than noun keyword were eliminated using Standford POS Tagger. Fourth, the noun keywords were then classified into each aspect. Finally, the aspect score was calculated based on the aspect-based sentiment analysis.Results: Result showed that the proposed method managed to turn raw review data into five aspects based on user perception.Conclusion: The study provides information for two parties, job seeker and the company. The analysis of the review could help the job seeker to decide which company that suits his need and ability. For the companies, it can be a great assistance because they will be more aware of their strengths and weaknesses. This study could possibly also provide ratings to the companies based on the aspects that have been determined.},

@article{tai_2022_hyperbolic_disentangled_representation_for_fine_grained_aspect_extraction,
	abstract = {Automatic identification of salient aspects from user reviews is especially useful for opinion analysis. There has been significant progress in utilizing weakly supervised approaches, which require only a small set of seed words for training aspect classifiers. However, there is always room for improvement. First, no weakly supervised approaches fully utilize latent hierarchies between words. Second, each seed word's representation should have different latent semantics and be distinct when it represents a different aspect. In this paper we propose HDAE, a hyperbolic disentangled aspect extractor in which a hyperbolic aspect classifier captures words' latent hierarchies, and an aspect-disentangled representation models the distinct latent semantics of each seed word. Compared to previous baselines, HDAE achieves average F1 performance gains of 18.2\% and 24.1\% on Amazon product review and restaurant review datasets, respectively. In addition, the embedding visualization experience demonstrates that HDAE is a more effective approach to leveraging seed words. An ablation study and a case study further attest the effectiveness of the proposed components.},

@article{shi_2021_a_simple_and_effective_self_supervised_contrastive_learning_framework_for_aspect_detection,
	abstract = {Unsupervised aspect detection (UAD) aims at automatically extracting interpretable aspects and identifying aspect-specific segments (such as sentences) from online reviews. However, recent deep learning based topic models, specifically aspect-based autoencoder, suffer from several problems such as extracting noisy aspects and poorly mapping aspects discovered by models to the aspects of interest. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we first propose a self-supervised contrastive learning framework and an attention-based model equipped with a novel smooth self-attention (SSA) module for the UAD task in order to learn better representations for aspects and review segments. Secondly, we introduce a high-resolution selective mapping (HRSMap) method to efficiently assign aspects discovered by the model to the aspects of interest. We also propose using a knowledge distillation technique to further improve the aspect detection performance. Our methods outperform several recent unsupervised and weakly supervised approaches on publicly available benchmark user review datasets. Aspect interpretation results show that extracted aspects are meaningful, have a good coverage, and can be easily mapped to aspects of interest. Ablation studies and attention weight visualization also demonstrate effectiveness of SSA and the knowledge distillation method.},

	abstract = {The major subtask of Sentiment analysis based on aspects (ABSA) is the category of aspectdetection (ACD). Due to the subjectivity inherent in categorizing, as well as the occurrence of overlapping classes, it is a difficult challenge to solve. Rule-based techniques, as well as other machine learning approaches, have been used to tackle ACD, and a majority of them are statistical behavior. We employed an association rulebased method in this article. We developed a mixed principle strategy that incorporates both association rule mining and semantics associations to address the statistical limitations of association rules. We employed the concept of word-embed for semantic linkages. The experiments were carried out using the SemEval dataset, which is a standardized set of data for categorizing features industry. We discovered how semantic connections could help to enhance classification accuracy by complementing statistical associations. The proposed method outperforms several statistical methods.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this study is to discover the factors affecting customer delight, satisfaction and dissatisfaction in fine dining experiences (FDEs).
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Online user generated 2,585 reviews on TripAdvisor for 46 five-star hotel restaurants operating in Istanbul were analyzed with the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm.
            
            
              Findings
              LDA created nine, eight and seven topics for delight, satisfaction and dissatisfaction, respectively. The most salient topics for customer delight, satisfaction and dissatisfaction in FDEs are staff (17.3\%), view (19\%), and food quality (23\%), respectively.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study is one of the few studies investigating customer delight and satisfaction together. The study shows that FDEs can be analyzed with text mining techniques. Moreover, the study contributes to the literature on customer delight by adding staff topic as an antecedent.},

@article{rintyarna_2019_evaluating_the_performance_of_sentence_level_features_and_domain_sensitive_features_of_product_reviews_on_supervised_sentiment_analysis_tasks,
	abstract = {Abstract
            With the popularity of e-commerce, posting online product reviews expressing customer's sentiment or opinion towards products has grown exponentially. Sentiment analysis is a computational method that plays an essential role in automating the extraction of subjective information i.e. customer's sentiment or opinion from online product reviews. Two approaches commonly used in Sentiment analysis tasks are supervised approaches and lexicon-based approaches. In supervised approaches, Sentiment analysis is seen as a text classification task. The result depends not only on the robustness of the machine learning algorithm but also on the utilized features. Bag-of-word is a common utilized features. As a statistical feature, bag-of-word does not take into account semantic of words. Previous research has indicated the potential of semantic in supervised SA task. To augment the result of sentiment analysis, this paper proposes a method to extract text features named sentence level features (SLF) and domain sensitive features (DSF) which take into account semantic of words in both sentence level and domain level of product reviews. A word sense disambiguation based method was adapted to extract SLF. For every similarity employed in generating SLF, the SentiCircle-based method was enhanced to generate DSF. Results of the experiments indicated that our proposed semantic features i.e. SLF and SLF + DSF favorably increase the performance of supervised sentiment analysis on product reviews.},

@article{yadav_2019_effectiveness_of_domain_based_lexicons_vis_a_vis_general_lexicon_for_aspect_level_sentiment_analysis_a_comparative_analysis,
	abstract = {One can either use machine learning techniques or lexicons to undertake sentiment analysis. Machine learning techniques include text classification algorithms like SVM, naive Bayes, decision tree or logistic regression, whereas lexicon-based sentiment analysis uses either general or domain-based lexicons. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of domain lexicons vis-{\`a}-vis general lexicon, wherein we have performed aspect-level sentiment analysis on data from three different domains, viz. car, guitar and book. While it is intuitive that domain lexicons will always perform better than general lexicons, the actual performance however may depend on the richness of the concerned domain lexicon as well as the text analysed. We used the general lexicon SentiWordNet and the corresponding domain lexicons in the aforesaid domains to compare their relative performances. The results indicate that domain lexicon used along with general lexicon performs better as compared to general lexicon or domain lexicon, when used alone. They also suggest that the performance of domain lexicons depends on the text content; and also on whether the language involves technical or non-technical words in the concerned domain. This paper makes a case for development of domain lexicons across various domains for improved performance, while gathering that they might not always perform better. It further highlights that the importance of general lexicons cannot be underestimated --- the best results for aspect-level sentiment analysis are obtained, as per this paper, when both the domain and general lexicons are used side by side.},

@article{alnawas_2019_sentiment_analysis_of_iraqi_arabic_dialect_on_facebook_based_on_distributed_representations_of_documents,
	abstract = {Nowadays, social media is used by many people to express their opinions about a variety of topics. Opinion Mining or Sentiment Analysis techniques extract opinions from user generated contents. Over the years, a multitude of Sentiment Analysis studies has been done about the English language with deficiencies of research in all other languages. Unfortunately, Arabic is one of the languages that seems to lack substantial research, despite the rapid growth of its use on social media outlets. Furthermore, specific Arabic dialects should be studied, not just Modern Standard Arabic. In this paper, we experiment sentiments analysis of Iraqi Arabic dialect using word embedding. First, we made a large corpus from previous works to learn word representations. Second, we generated word embedding model by training corpus using Doc2Vec representations based on Paragraph and Distributed Memory Model of Paragraph Vectors (DM-PV) architecture. Lastly, the represented feature used for training four binary classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes) to detect sentiment. We also experimented different values of parameters (window size, dimension and negative samples). In the light of the experiments, it can be concluded that our approach achieves a better performance for Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine than the other classifiers.},

@article{alqaryouti_2020_aspect_based_sentiment_analysis_using_smart_government_review_data,
	abstract = {Digital resources such as smart applications reviews and online feedback information are important sources to seek customers' feedback and input. This paper aims to help government entities gain insights on the needs and expectations of their customers. Towards this end, we propose an aspect-based sentiment analysis hybrid approach that integrates domain lexicons and rules to analyse the entities smart apps reviews. The proposed model aims to extract the important aspects from the reviews and classify the corresponding sentiments. This approach adopts language processing techniques, rules, and lexicons to address several sentiment analysis challenges, and produce summarized results. According to the reported results, the aspect extraction accuracy improves significantly when the implicit aspects are considered. Also, the integrated classification model outperforms the lexicon-based baseline and the other rules combinations by 5\% in terms of Accuracy on average. Also, when using the same dataset, the proposed approach outperforms machine learning approaches that uses support vector machine (SVM). However, using these lexicons and rules as input features to the SVM model has achieved higher accuracy than other SVM models.},

For these kind of reasons, feature selection is utilized to detect the opinion among different reviews and comments. Sentiment analysis is becoming like phenomenon due to increase of social media's popularity. Currently, significant advancements are shown in this research domain, but still multiple challenges are to be solved -- i.e., sentiment analysis in cross domains. In this paper rumbustious feature selection based genetic algorithm is proposed to address the problem of analyzing the sentiments in cross domain. It performs classification based optimistic-class and pessimistic-class. The dataset used to this research work includes books, DVDs, gadgets and kitchen appliances. Initially the features selection is performed and opinion mining is performed by Genetic Algorithm. Benchmark performance metrics are selected for measuring the performance of proposed work against existing method. Results depict that the proposed work has better performance than that of the existing work as far as chosen performance metrics.},

@article{liu_2019_attention_based_sentiment_reasoner_for_aspect_based_sentiment_analysis,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a powerful way of predicting the sentiment polarity of text in natural language processing. However, understanding human emotions and reasoning from text like a human continues to be a challenge. In this paper, we propose a model, named Attention-based Sentiment Reasoner (AS-Reasoner), to alleviate the problem of how to capture precise sentiment expressions in ABSA for reasoning. AS-Reasoner assigns importance degrees to different words in a sentence to capture key sentiment expressions towards a specific aspect, and transfers them into a sentiment sentence representation for reasoning in the next layer. To obtain appropriate importance degree values for different words in a sentence, two attention mechanisms we designed: intra attention and global attention. Specifically, intra attention captures the sentiment similarity between any two words in a sentence to compute weights and global attention computes weights by a global perspective. Experiments on all four English and four Chinese datasets show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and macro-F1 results for aspect term level sentiment analysis and obtains the best accuracy for aspect category level sentiment analysis. The experimental results also indicate that AS-Reasoner is language-independent.},

@article{qin_2021_exploring_the_distribution_regularities_of_user_attention_and_sentiment_toward_product_aspects_in_online_reviews,
	abstract = {Purpose
              To better understand the online reviews and help potential consumers, businessmen and product manufacturers effectively obtain users' evaluation on product aspects, this paper aims to explore the distribution regularities of users' attention and sentiment on product aspects from the temporal perspective of online reviews.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Temporal characteristics of online reviews (purchase time, review time and time intervals between purchase time and review time), similar attributes clustering and attribute-level sentiment computing technologies are used based on more than 340k smartphone reviews of three products from JD.COM (a famous online shopping platform in China) to explore the distribution regularities of users' attention and sentiment on product aspects in this paper.
            
            
              Findings
              The empirical results show that a power-law distribution can fit users' attention on product aspects, and the reviews posted in short time intervals contain more product aspects. Besides, the results show that the values of users' sentiment on product aspects are significantly higher/lower in short time intervals which contribute to judging the advantages and weaknesses of a product.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              This paper cannot acquire online reviews for more products with temporal characteristics to verify the findings because of the restriction on reviews crawling by the shopping platforms.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This work reveals the distribution regularities of users' attention and sentiment on product aspects, which is of great significance in assisting decision-making, optimizing review presentation and improving the shopping experience.},

	abstract = {We do not trust technologies like we trust people, rather we rely on them. This article argues for an emphasis on reliance rather than trust as a concept for understanding human relationships with technology. Reliance is important because researchers can empirically measure the reliability of a given technology. We first explore two frameworks of trust and reliance. We then examine how reliance can be measured by conducting systematic literature reviews of reported success metrics for given technologies. Specifically, we examine papers which present models for predicting private traits from social media data. Of the 72 models for predicting private traits that were surveyed from 31 papers, 80\% of the methods reported success rates lower than 90\%, indicating a general unreliability in predicting private traits. We illustrate the current applicability of this method throughout the article by discussing the Cambridge Analytica scandal that began during the 2016 US Presidential election.},

	abstract = {AbstractInternet users are increasing over time. The increasing of internet users, especially for youth people, tends to create internet addiction in each user. Internet addiction in youth people is interesting to know their attitudes and behavior psychologically, because it is related to their daily conditions. This research was conducted to answer the psychological dynamics of youth people with internet addiction. To answer that, there are some research questions such as what factors make young people addicted to the internet? what do they feel when not using the internet? and what are the impacts of using the internet for them? The research method uses qualitative methods with narrative descriptive approaches. Data analysis using thematic data analysis. The results showed that 1) the need for affiliation, high curiosity about information, and online business became the reason youth people access the internet, 2) youth people feel anxious and loneliness when not accessing the internet, 3) the impact of accessing the internet such as sad and happy on their emotions that occur according to situations and conditions. In addition, researchers also found interesting things from their attitude who experienced boredom when often using the internet but failed for them to stop or reduce access to the internet. The conclusion that the internet now is a necessary for youth people, because the internet has a major impact on their psychological factors. AbstrakPengguna internet semakin bertambah dari waktu ke waktu. Jumlah penggunanaan internet yang semakin meningkat khususnya pada anak muda cenderung dapat menciptakan kecanduan internet pada diri masing-masing pengguna. Kecanduan internet pada anak muda menarik untuk diketahui sikap dan perilakunya secara psikologis, karena hal itu berkaitan dengan kondisi keseharian mereka. Penelitian ini dilakukan untuk menjawab dinamika psikologis anak muda yang kecanduan internet. Untuk menjawab hal itu, terdapat beberapa pertanyaan penelitian seperti faktor apa yang membuat anak muda kecanduan internet? apa yang mereka rasakan ketika tidak menggunakan internet? serta apa dampak dari penggunaan internet bagi mereka? Metode penelitian menggunakan metode kualitatif dengan pendekatan naratif deskripif. Analisis data menggunakan analisis data tematik. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa 1) kebutuhan untuk afliasi, keingintahuan yang tinggi terhadap informasi, dan bisnis online menjadi alasan anak muda mengakses internet, 2) anak muda merasa cemas dan kesepian ketika tidak mengakses internet, 3) dampak dari mengakses internet berupa perasaan sedih dan senang pada emosi mereka yang terjadi sesuai situasi dan kondisi. Selain itu, peneliti juga menemukan hal yang menarik dari sikap mereka yang mengalami kebosanan ketika sering bermain internet namun gagal bagi mereka untuk berhenti maupun mengurangi dalam mengakses internet. Kesimpulan bahwa internet saat ini sudah menjadi kebutuhan anak muda, karena internet berdampak besar pada faktor psikologis mereka.},

@article{zheng_2022_efficient_recognition_of_dynamic_user_emotions_based_on_deep_neural_networks,
	abstract = {The key issue at this stage is how to mine the large amount of valuable user sentiment information from the massive amount of web text and create a suitable dynamic user text sentiment analysis technique. Hence, this study offers a writing feature abstraction process based on ON-LSTM and attention mechanism to address the problem that syntactic information is ignored in emotional text feature extraction. The study found that the Att-ON-LSTM improved the micro-average F1 value by 2.27\% and the macro-average F value by 1.7\% compared to the Bi-LSTM model with the added attentivity mechanisms. It is demonstrated that it can perform better extraction of semantic information and hierarchical structure information in emotional text and obtain more comprehensive emotional text features. In addition, the ON-LSTM-LS, a sentiment analysis model based on ON-LSTM and tag semantics, is planned to address the problem that tag semantics is ignored in the process of text sentiment analysis. The experimental consequences exposed that the accuracy of the ON-LSTM and labeled semantic sentiment analysis model on the test set is improved by 0.78\% with the addition of labeled word directions compared to the model Att-ON-LSTM without the addition of labeled semantic information. The macro-averaged F1 value improved by 1.04\%, which indicates that the sentiment analysis process based on ON-LSTM and tag semantics can effectively perform the text sentiment analysis task and improve the sentiment classification effect to some extent. In conclusion, deep learning models for dynamic user sentiment analysis possess high application capabilities.},

	abstract = {Large quantities of textual posts are increasingly generated in course discussion forums, and the accumulation of these data greatly increases the cognitive loads on online participants. It is imperative for them to automatically identify the potential semantic information derived from these textual discourse interactions. Moreover, existing topic models can discover the latent topics or sentimental polarities from textual data, but these models typically ignore the interactive ways of discussing topics, thus making it difficult to further construct topics' semantic space from the perspective of document generation. To solve this issue, we proposed a joint sentiment and behaviour topic model called SBTM, which was an unsupervised approach for automatic analysis of learners' discussed posts. The results demonstrated that SBTM was quantitatively effective on both model generalisation and topic exploration, and rich topic content was qualitatively characterised. Furthermore, the model can be potentially employed in some practical applications, such as information summarisation and behaviour-oriented personalised recommendation.},

@article{jin_2022_a_user_based_topic_model_with_topical_word_embeddings_for_semantic_modelling_in_social_network,
	abstract = {With the development of the Internet and mobile networks, social networks have gradually become an essential tool and widespread application. Therefore, the research on short text semantic modelling of social networks has attracted widespread attention. However, modelling short texts encounter the semantics sparsity and multiple meanings of a word in social networks. To solve the above problems, we propose a user-based topic model with topical word embeddings semantic modelling method, namely SM-UTM. Firstly, we construct the user topic model to aggregate short text. Secondly, we build word pair in the user topic model to alleviate semantics sparsity in social networks. In addition, we introduce the time information of social networks into the topic model to jointly constrain the generation process of topics, to improve the quality of semantic representation of social network short texts. Finally, we use the topic word embedding learning based on deep learning to train and optimize the word vector according to the learning results of the user topic model, to alleviate the problem of polysemy in social networks. We build multiple groups of quantitative and qualitative experiments based on the crawled real Sina Weibo data. The experimental results show that our SM-UTM is significantly better than the comparison method in the evaluation indicators of topic consistency, purity and entropy.},

@article{niu_2021_a_nested_chinese_restaurant_topic_model_for_short_texts_with_document_embeddings,
	abstract = {In recent years, short texts have become a kind of prevalent text on the internet. Due to the short length of each text, conventional topic models for short texts suffer from the sparsity of word co-occurrence information. Researchers have proposed different kinds of customized topic models for short texts by providing additional word co-occurrence information. However, these models cannot incorporate sufficient semantic word co-occurrence information and may bring additional noisy information. To address these issues, we propose a self-aggregated topic model incorporating document embeddings. Aggregating short texts into long documents according to document embeddings can provide sufficient word co-occurrence information and avoid incorporating non-semantic word co-occurrence information. However, document embeddings of short texts contain a lot of noisy information resulting from the sparsity of word co-occurrence information. So we discard noisy information by changing the document embeddings into global and local semantic information. The global semantic information is the similarity probability distribution on the entire dataset and the local semantic information is the distances of similar short texts. Then we adopt a nested Chinese restaurant process to incorporate these two kinds of information. Finally, we compare our model to several state-of-the-art models on four real-world short texts corpus. The experiment results show that our model achieves better performances in terms of topic coherence and classification accuracy.},

@techreport{didegah_2018_using_a_diabetes_discussion_forum_and_wikipedia_to_detect_the_alignment_of_public_interests_and_the_research_literature,
	abstract = {Background

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It is therefore unsurprising that there is a high volume of public discussions, resources, and research tackling various aspects of the disease. Over the last decade, more than hundred thousand research articles have been published by researchers and countless of online discussions have taken place on various online platforms. This study is an attempt to identify the areas of public interest, related to diabetes, by looking at online discussion forums and to evaluate their relationship to pages about diabetes found on Wikipedia and to the academic research about the topic. The main aim is to investigate the extent to which researchers are responding to the public's interests and concerns, and to the level of uptake of the research topics in the public sphere.

Methodology/Principal findings

To detect public interests and concerns in diabetes, we collected posts on a popular diabetes discussion forum (DiabeticConnect) and pages (articles) about diabetes published in Wikipedia. We also downloaded the titles and abstracts of research articles about diabetes from the Scopus database, all between 2008 and 2016. Tags assigned to each post in the discussion forum were used along with the post itself to compute a Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LLDA) model, which was then used to classify the Wikipedia pages and research articles. The resulting classifications were then used to compare the prevalence of the topics found in the discussion forum with those of the other two sources. The results show that while research articles and Wikipedia pages about diabetes focus on diabetes testing, treatments, and disease control, the public forum discussions focus on Type 2 diabetes, emotional support, and proper diet for diabetic patients. However, for some other topics there was an alignment in the relative rise and fall of interest across the three platforms.

Conclusions/Significance

The alignment and misalignment in the changes of relative interest over the various topics is evidence that the LLDA modelling can be useful for comparing a public corpus, like a diabetes forum, and an academic one, like research titles and abstracts. The success of using LLDA to classify research articles based on the tags assigned to posts in a public discussion forum shows that this a promising method for better understanding how the scientific community responds to public interests and needs, and, on the flip side, how the public takes up the language and topics discussed by the academic community.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Clinical research broadly aims to influence decision-making in order to promote appropriate healthcare. Funding agencies should prioritise research projects according to needed research topics, methodological and cost-effectiveness considerations, and expected social value. In Chile, there is no local diagnosis regarding recent clinical research that might inform prioritisation for future research funding. This research aims to comprehensively identify and classify Chilean health research studies, elaborating evidence gap maps for the most burdensome local conditions.
            
            
              Methods and analysis
              We will search in electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS and WoS) and perform hand searches to retrieve, identify and classify health research studies conducted in Chile or by authors whose affiliations are based in Chile, from 2000 onwards. We will elaborate evidence matrices for the 20 conditions with the highest burden in Chile (according to the Global Burden of Disease 2019) selected from those defined under the General Regime of the Health Guarantees Act. To elaborate the evidence gap maps, we will consider prioritised interventions and core outcome sets. To identify knowledge gaps and estimate redundant research, we will contrast these gap maps with the available international evidence of high or moderate certainty of evidence, for each specific clinical question. For this purpose, we will search systematic reviews using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
            
            
              Ethics and dissemination
              No ethical approval is required to conduct this project. We will submit our results in both peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences. We will aim to disseminate our findings through different academic platforms, social media, local press, among others. The final results will be communicated to local funding agencies and government stakeholders.
            
            
              Discussion
              We aim to provide an accurate and up-to-date picture of the research gaps---to be filled by new future findings---and the identification of redundant research, which will constitute relevant information for local decision-makers.},

            This paper aims to map and identify topics of interest within the field of Microbiology and identify the main sources driving such attention. We combine data from Web of Science and Altmetric.com, a platform which retrieves mentions to scientific literature from social media and other non-academic communication outlets. We focus on the dissemination of microbial publications in Twitter, news media and policy briefs. A two-mode network of social accounts shows distinctive areas of activity. We identify a cluster of papers mentioned solely by regional news media. A central area of the network is formed by papers discussed by the three outlets. A large portion of the network is driven by Twitter activity. When analyzing top actors contributing to such network, we observe that more than half of the Twitter accounts are bots, mentioning 32\% of the documents in our dataset. Within news media outlets, there is a predominance of popular science outlets. With regard to policy briefs, both international and national bodies are represented. Finally, our topic analysis shows that the thematic focus of papers mentioned varies by outlet. While news media cover the wider range of topics, policy briefs are focused on translational medicine and bacterial outbreaks.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Great progress in microbiota research during last decades resulted in a growing corpus of publications mentioning the term `microbiota'. Specifically, the human microbiota increasingly recognised nowadays as one of the most important health challenges is becoming an emerging research front. By examining over 28 000 microbiota-related papers from the Web of Science database, our study aims to characterise the evolution of publication patterns in this field between 1999 and 2017. The corpus is first analysed in terms of breakdown by journal subject categories, then an additional insight in the structuring of the microbiota research into different topics is provided by means of topic modelling. Our results demonstrate that over time (i) a substantial increase in the publications number is accompanied by a broad diversification of associated journal subject categories; (ii) the research focus moved outside from its primary research field showing successive shifts from dentistry and ecologically centred areas, through agri-food applied topics, towards the most recent clinical applications. The trends in thematic structure of the field presented from a historical perspective suggest that the current systemic approach to host--microbiota relationship inherited from the ecological background of the concept of microbiota has opened up a number of new research directions and perspectives.},

In this paper, we analyze the inclusion of SD in AI research indexed by the IEEE Xplore database from 2000 to 2019. We address three critical questions: 1) To what extent is AI research addressing the sustainable development goals (SDGs)? 2) Which subject areas of AI show an emerging interest in SD? And 3) What patterns of collaboration between regions of the world are being stimulated by AI? Our scientometric analysis consists of 1) Identifying the number of AI papers that address SDGs in their titles, abstracts, and keywords. 2) Developing a composite indicator based on the number of documents produced, scientific impact, and inventive impact to distinguish areas with an emerging interest in SD; 3) Exploring co-authorship networks at three levels: region, income group, and country. The overall results show that a small share of papers is explicitly focused on SD. Our composite indicator allowed us to identify an emerging interest in SD from Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, Education, Consumer Electronics, Electrical Engineering, Electromagnetic Compatibility and Interference. Specifically, on AI subjects, we found emerging interests in Prediction Methods, Computation Theory, Machine Learning, Learning (artificial intelligence), and Biological Neural Networks. Inter-regional and inter-income group collaboration are limited, and network power is concentrated in a few countries. The results could be useful to improve the connection between technical knowledge, strategic planning for S\&amp;T investment, and SD policies.},

	abstract = {Background: Community engagement has been given different interpretations by scholars and organisations; in addition, current scientific literature has not reached a consensus on how it is defined. This difference in conceptualisation may lead to confusion regarding the meaning. The researcher observed that academic staff from the Faculty of Health Science at an institution of higher education in Namibia are not certain of what counts as community engagement. This has led to some activities from the faculty being cancelled from the institutional review reports as they were not recognised as community engagement.Aim: The aim of this article is to describe the concept analysis of community engagement.Setting: the study took place at a faculty of health science at a university in Namibia.Method: Concept analysis was done in accordance with the eight steps of the Walker and Avant model. A literature search was conducted to capture all potential definitions and uses of community engagement. A total of 225 definitions and uses of community engagement were recorded and used in the concept analysis. A list of definitions and uses of the concept of community engagement were documented with their citations, in a table with three columns. The first column (analysis) consisted of the identified definitions and uses of community engagement from the relevant literature. The second column (synthesis) consisted of reduced statements of the content presented in the first column. The third column (derivation) consisted of the final reduction into categories and connotations derived from the second column.Findings: Three broad categories were revealed as findings: (1) the antecedents of community engagement, which included community challenges, health inequalities, societal needs and the need for a social responsive approach in education, research and services; (2) a three-phase process of community engagement; and (3) the outcomes of community engagement. A theoretical definition and a conceptual map for the concept of community engagement were drawn from the findings.Recommendation: The results of the concept analysis of community engagement will be used to develop strategies for its facilitation in the Faculty of Health Science.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Mapping the intellectual structure and dynamics of complex, multidisciplinary domains has long been a challenging task for bibliometrics. Research subjects with outstanding social relevance are typically of this sort, being multifaceted and requiring a synthesis of various field-specific perspectives. Among such subjects, our work addresses policy-related research on obesity, and aims to uncover how this multilevel issue is represented in policy studies through its dense thematic interrelations, and at the interfaces of various research areas participating in the discourse. In doing so, we propose an analytic framework combining so-called hybrid methods of science mapping with the (traditional) use of alluvial diagrams, resulting in what we refer to as ``multicluster topics'' and ``interdisciplinarity maps''. Therefore, the contribution of this paper can be considered both at the subject and at the methodological level.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Aim
              Obesity research priority setting, if conducted to a high standard, can help promote policy-relevant and efficient research. Therefore, there is a need to identify existing research priority setting studies conducted in the topic area of obesity and to determine the extent to which they followed good practice principles for research priority setting.
            
            
              Method
              Studies examining research priority setting in obesity were identified through searching the MEDLINE, PBSC, CINAHL, PsycINFO databases and the grey literature. The nine common themes of good practice in research priority setting were used as a methodological framework to evaluate the processes of the included studies. These were context, use of a comprehensive approach, inclusiveness, information gathering, planning for implementation, criteria, methods for deciding on priorities, evaluation and transparency.
            
            
              Results
              Thirteen articles reporting research prioritisation exercises conducted in different areas of obesity research were included. All studies reported engaging with various stakeholders such as policy makers, researchers and healthcare professionals. Public involvement was included in six studies. Methods of research prioritisation commonly included both Delphi and nominal group techniques and surveys. None of the 13 studies fulfilled all nine of the good practice criteria for research priority setting, with the most common limitations including not using a comprehensive approach and lack of inclusivity and evaluating on their processes.
            
            
              Conclusion
              There is a need for research priority setting studies in obesity to involve the public and to evaluate their exercises to ensure they are of high quality.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Academic research is one of the main avenues through which humans can fight the threat of infectious diseases. However, there have been concerns regarding whether the academic system has provided sufficient efforts to fight infectious diseases we potentially face. Answering these questions could contribute to evidence-based recommendations for setting research priorities and third-mission policies.
            
            
              Methods
              With a focus on one of the most common categories of communicable diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases (IPDs), we searched Web of Science for articles and reviews relevant to IPDs published during the period 2000--2019 and retrieved WHO data on disease burden in corresponding years. The academic response patterns were explored by IPD subcategory and by human development level (an index established by the United Nations). We conduct the analysis in particular to gain insight into the dynamic relationship between disease burden and research effort on IPDs, scientific efforts contributed by countries with different development levels, and the variation trends in international joint efforts.
            
            
              Results
              The greatest burden of IPDs is clustered in the developing regions of Africa, but has received academic response from both developed and developing countries. Highly developed countries dominate the ranks of academic research in this area, yet there is also a clear increase in research efforts from the countries most affected, despite their low human development scale. In fact, the overall analysis reveals an improved capability for addressing local problems from African regions. In terms of international collaboration, highly developed countries such as the United States and United Kingdom have commonly collaborated with needy regions, whereas prolific but developing nations, like China, have not.
            
            
              Conclusions
              From a global perspective, academia has positively responded to health needs caused by IPDs. Although the relevant research output contribution is primarily from the highly developed countries, concentrated and specialized efforts from the undeveloped regions to ease their local burden can be clearly observed. Our findings also indicate a tendency to focus more on local health needs for both developed and undeveloped regions. The insights revealed in this study should benefit a more informed and systemic plan of research priorities.},

	abstract = {The degree of concentration in research funding has long been a principal matter of contention in science policy. Strong concentration has been seen as a tool for optimizing and focusing research investments but also as a damaging path towards hypercompetition, diminished diversity, and conservative topic selection. While several studies have documented funding concentration linked to individual funding organizations, few have looked at funding concentration from a systemic perspective. In this article, we examine nearly 20,000 competitive grants allocated by 15 major Danish research funders. Our results show a strongly skewed allocation of funding towards a small elite of individual researchers, and towards a select group of research areas and topics. We discuss potential drivers and highlight that funding concentration likely results from a complex interplay between funders' overlapping priorities, excellence-dominated evaluation criteria, and lack of coordination between both public and private research funding bodies.},

	abstract = {Research and development in hypersonics have progressed significantly in recent years, with various military and commercial applications being demonstrated increasingly. Public and private organizations in several countries have been investing in hypersonics, with the aim to overtake their competitors and secure/improve strategic advantage and deterrence. For these organizations, being able to identify emerging technologies in a timely and reliable manner is paramount. Recent advances in information technology have made it possible to analyze large amounts of data, extract hidden patterns, and provide decision-makers with new insights. In this study, we focus on scientific publications about hypersonics within the period of 2000-2020, and employ natural language processing and machine learning to characterize the research landscape by identifying 12 key latent research themes and analyzing their temporal evolution. Our publication similarity analysis revealed patterns that are indicative of cycles during two decades of research. The study offers a comprehensive analysis of the research field and the fact that the research themes are algorithmically extracted removes subjectivity from the exercise and enables consistent comparisons between topics and between time intervals.},

@article{zhang_2022_discovery_of_topic_evolution_path_and_semantic_relationship_based_on_patent_entity_representation,
	abstract = {Purpose
              This paper aims to propose a method for better discovering topic evolution path and semantic relationship from the perspective of patent entity extraction and semantic representation. On the one hand, this paper identifies entities that have the same semantics but different expressions for accurate topic evolution path discovery. On the other hand, this paper reveals semantic relationships of topic evolution for better understanding what leads to topic evolution.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Firstly, a Bi-LSTM-CRF (bidirectional long short-term memory with conditional random field) model is designed for patent entity extraction and a representation learning method is constructed for patent entity representation. Secondly, a method based on knowledge outflow and inflow is proposed for discovering topic evolution path, by identifying and computing semantic common entities among topics. Finally, multiple semantic relationships among patent entities are pre-designed according to a specific domain, and then the semantic relationship among topics is identified through the proportion of different types of semantic relationships belonging to each topic.
            
            
              Findings
              In the field of UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), this method identifies semantic common entities which have the same semantics but different expressions. In addition, this method better discovers topic evolution paths by comparison with a traditional method. Finally, this method identifies different semantic relationships among topics, which gives a detailed description for understanding and interpretation of topic evolution. These results prove that the proposed method is effective and useful. Simultaneously, this method is a preliminary study and still needs to be further investigated on other datasets using multiple emerging deep learning methods.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This work provides a new perspective for topic evolution analysis by considering semantic representation of patent entities. The authors design a method for discovering topic evolution paths by considering knowledge flow computed by semantic common entities, which can be easily extended to other patent mining-related tasks. This work is the first attempt to reveal semantic relationships among topics for a precise and detailed description of topic evolution.},

@article{liu_2020_mapping_the_technology_evolution_path_a_novel_model_for_dynamic_topic_detection_and_tracking,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Identifying the evolution path of a research field is essential to scientific and technological innovation. There have been many attempts to identify the technology evolution path based on the topic model or social networks analysis, but many of them had deficiencies in methodology. First, many studies have only considered a single type of information (text or citation information) in scientific literature, which may lead to incomplete technology path mapping. Second, the number of topics in each period cannot be determined automatically, making dynamic topic tracking difficult. Third, data mining methods fail to be effectively combined with visual analysis, which will affect the efficiency and flexibility of mapping. In this study, we developed a method for mapping the technology evolution path using a novel non-parametric topic model, the citation involved Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (CIHDP), to achieve better topic detection and tracking of scientific literature. To better present and analyze the path, D3.js is used to visualize the splitting and fusion of the evolutionary path. We used this novel model to mapping the artificial intelligence research domain, through a successful mapping of the evolution path, the proposed method's validity and merits are shown. After incorporating the citation information, we found that the CIHDP can be mapping a complete path evolution process and had better performance than the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process and LDA. This method can be helpful for understanding and analyzing the development of technical topics. Moreover, it can be well used to map the science or technology of the innovation ecosystem. It may also arouse the interest of technology evolution path researchers or policymakers.},

	abstract = {Objectives
              This paper aimed to identify the technology frontiers of artificial intelligence-assisted pathology based on patent citation network.
            
            
              Methods
              Patents related to artificial intelligence-assisted pathology were searched and collected from the Derwent Innovation Index (DII), which were imported into Derwent Data Analyzer (DDA, Clarivate Derwent, New York, NY, USA) for authority control, and imported into the freely available computer program Ucinet 6 for drawing the patent citation network. The patent citation network according to the citation relationship could describe the technology development context in the field of artificial intelligence-assisted pathology. The patent citations were extracted from the collected patent data, selected highly cited patents to form a co-occurrence matrix, and built a patent citation network based on the co-occurrence matrix in each period. Text clustering is an unsupervised learning method, an important method in text mining, where similar documents are grouped into clusters. The similarity between documents are determined by calculating the distance between them, and the two documents with the closest distance are combined. The method of text clustering was used to identify the technology frontiers based on the patent citation network, which was according to co-word analysis of the title and abstract of the patents in this field.
            
            
              Results
              1704 patents were obtained in the field of artificial intelligence-assisted pathology, which had been currently undergoing three stages, namely the budding period (1992--2000), the development period (2001--2015), and the rapid growth period (2016--2021). There were two technology frontiers in the budding period (1992--2000), namely systems and methods for image data processing in computerized tomography (CT), and immunohistochemistry (IHC), five technology frontiers in the development period (2001--2015), namely spectral analysis methods of biomacromolecules, pathological information system, diagnostic biomarkers, molecular pathology diagnosis, and pathological diagnosis antibody, and six technology frontiers in the rapid growth period (2016--2021), namely digital pathology (DP), deep learning (DL) algorithms---convolutional neural networks (CNN), disease prediction models, computational pathology, pathological image analysis method, and intelligent pathological system.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Artificial intelligence-assisted pathology was currently in a rapid development period, and computational pathology, DL and other technologies in this period all involved the study of algorithms. Future research hotspots in this field would focus on algorithm improvement and intelligent diagnosis in order to realize the precise diagnosis. The results of this study presented an overview of the characteristics of research status and development trends in the field of artificial intelligence-assisted pathology, which could help readers broaden innovative ideas and discover new technological opportunities, and also served as important indicators for government policymaking.},

@article{cascajares_2020_the_contribution_of_spanish_science_to_patents_medicine_as_case_of_study,
	abstract = {Investments in research and development (R\&D) and innovation are expensive, and one wishes to be assured that there is positive feedback and to receive guidance on how to direct investments in the future. The social or economic benefits of investments in R\&D are of particular interest to policymakers. In this regard, public expense in research, especially through universities, is sometimes being questioned. This paper establishes a measure of how research in Spain, and specifically in its universities, is involved. In this study, we have analyzed all the literature cited in the period 1998--2018 produced by Spanish institutions and which has been cited in at least one international patent, obtaining more than 40,000 publications from more than 160,000 different authors. The data have been surprisingly positive, showing that practically all public universities contribute to this subject and that there is a great deal of international collaboration, both in terms of the number of countries with which they collaborate and the prestige of the institutions involved. Regarding the specific scientific fields in which this collaboration is most relevant, biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology, and medicine together account for almost 40\% of the total works. The topics most used by these publications were those of diseases or medical problems such as: Neoplams, Carcinoma, Alzheimer Disease, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Oncology was according to the All Science Journal Classification (ASJC) the leading and central issue. Therefore, although the result of basic research is difficult to quantify, when it is observed that there is a return in fields such as medicine or global health, it can be said that it is well employed. In terms of journals from a purely bibliometric point of view, it has been observed that some journals do not have a great impact or relative position within their categories, but they do have a great relevance in this area of patent support. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to set up a rank for scientific journals based on the citations of patents, so the percentage of articles cited in patents with Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) {\textgreater}1, and as an indicator of scientific transfer from universities or research centres, the transference index in patents (TIP) is also proposed.},

	abstract = {Understanding about nature of science is important topic in science education as well as in pre-service science teacher education. In science education, Nature of Science (NOS), in its different forms of educational scaffoldings, seeks to provide with students an understanding of features of scientific knowledge and science in general, how scientific knowledge changes and becomes accepted, and what factors guide scientific activities. For a science teacher, deep and broad enough picture of sciences is therefore of importance. This study attempts to show that the research field called Science of Science (SoS) can significantly support building such a panoramic picture of sciences, and through that, significantly support NOS. The SoS approaches the structure and dynamics of science quantitatively, using scientific documents (e.g., publications, reports, books and monographs and patent applications) as trails to map the landscape of sciences. It is argued here that SoS may provide material and interesting cases for NOS, and in so doing enrich NOS in a similarly significant way as history, philosophy and sociology of science (HPSS) scholarship has done thus far. This study introduces several themes based on SoS that are of relevance for NOS as they were introduced and discussed in a pre-service science teachers' course. The feedback from pre-service teachers shows that introducing SoS, with minimal additional philosophical interpretations and discussions, but simply as evidential facts and findings, sparks ideas and views that come very close to NOS themes and topics. Discussions related to nature of science, and specific educational NOS scaffoldings for it, can find a good companion in SoS; the latter providing facts and evidence of thee structure and dynamics of sciences, the former providing perspectives for interpretations.},

	abstract = {Interest in tracing the research interests of scientific researchers is rising, and particularly that of predicting a researcher's knowledge trajectories beyond their current foci into potential inter-/cross-/multi-disciplinary interactions. Hence, in this study, we present a method of diffusion-based network analytics for knowledge trajectory recommendation. The method begins by constructing a heterogeneous bibliometric network consisting of a co-topic layer and a co-authorship layer. A novel link prediction approach with a diffusion strategy is then used to reflect real-world academic activity, such as knowledge sharing between co-authors or diffusing between similar research topics. This strategy differentiates the interactions occurring between homogeneous and heterogeneous nodes and weights the strengths of these interactions. Two sets of experiments - one with a local dataset and another with a global dataset - demonstrate that the proposed method is prior to selected baselines. In addition, to further examine the reliability of our method, we conducted a case study on recommending knowledge trajectories of selected information scientists and their research groups. The results demonstrate the empirical insights our method yields for individual researchers, communities, and research institutions in the information science discipline.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a nonelliptic extended English teaching ability evaluation algorithm based on an adaptive random matrix model. The algorithm models a nonelliptical expansion target as multiple elliptical sub-objectives, and the expansion state of each sub-target is described by an inverse Wishart distribution. The new method is combined to improve the robustness problem caused by the initialization after the algorithm expansion. This research uses the smart teacher education platform to conduct research and analysis on the evaluation of teaching practice ability of intern normal students. From the perspective of data evaluation, we explore the influence of normal students' curriculum training on the teaching practice ability of normal students. By analyzing the correlation between normal students' course grades and practice grades, this paper explores the influence of normal students' prepractice training on normal students' teaching practice ability. This paper explores the influence of the training of normal students' course learning on the teaching practice ability of normal students. The results show that the learning level of normal students' professional courses has a significant impact on the development of normal students' practice performance and teaching practice ability; the impact of normal students' pedagogical course level on normal students' practice performance and teaching practice ability is relatively low.},

A trav{\'e}s de tres motores de b{\'u}squedas (ScienceDirect, Scopus y SciELO), se realiz{\'o} una exploraci{\'o}n pormenorizada con la ecuaci{\'o}n en espa{\~n}ol e ingl{\'e}s: ``verdad'', ``validez cognoscitiva'', ``conocimiento cient{\'\i}fico'' y ``consultor{\'\i}a administrativa''. Se revisaron 29 art{\'\i}culos para el an{\'a}lisis conceptual de las palabras claves, mediante 28 revistas cient{\'\i}ficas, consider{\'a}ndose el contraste entre la relaci{\'o}n de las mismas con la finalidad de construcci{\'o}n de premisas para la instrumentaci{\'o}n e implementaci{\'o}n de la consultor{\'\i}a administrativa.  Pues, a partir del conocimiento emp{\'\i}rico, se realiza un an{\'a}lisis para la construcci{\'o}n del conocimiento cient{\'\i}fico, definiendo las cualidades superiores entre ellos. Se constata la relaci{\'o}n del conocimiento con la administraci{\'o}n de consultor{\'\i}a empresarial, constituyendo premisas en la gesti{\'o}n del conocimiento, debido a que, los an{\'a}lisis referenciales estudiados constituyen aportes, que permiten al gestor en consultor{\'\i}a administrativa contribuir a la planeaci{\'o}n y concepci{\'o}n estrat{\'e}gica, en la gesti{\'o}n integral de los procesos organizacionales. Se concluye con supuestas premisas de aceptar o rechazar, a partir de la necesidad de interacci{\'o}n de diferentes disciplinas para validar conocimiento como fuente originaria para la administraci{\'o}n.},

@article{zhao_2022_intellectual_structure_of_information_science_2011__2020_an_author_co_citation_analysis,
	abstract = {Purpose
              This study continues a long history of author co-citation analysis of the intellectual structure of information science into the time period of 2011--2020. It also examines changes in this structure from 2006--2010 through 2011--2015 to 2016--2020. Results will contribute to a better understanding of the information science research field.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The well-established procedures and techniques for author co-citation analysis were followed. Full records of research articles in core information science journals published during 2011--2020 were retrieved and downloaded from the Web of Science database. About 150 most highly cited authors in each of the two five-year time periods were selected from this dataset to represent this field, and their co-citation counts were calculated. Each co-citation matrix was input into SPSS for factor analysis, and results were visualized in Pajek. Factors were interpreted as specialties and labeled upon an examination of articles written by authors who load primarily on each factor.
            
            
              Findings
              The two-camp structure of information science continued to be present clearly. Bibliometric indicators for research evaluation dominated the Knowledge Domain Analysis camp during both fivr-year time periods, whereas interactive information retrieval (IR) dominated the IR camp during 2011--2015 but shared dominance with information behavior during 2016--2020. Bridging between the two camps became increasingly weaker and was only provided by the scholarly communication specialty during 2016--2020. The IR systems specialty drifted further away from the IR camp. The information behavior specialty experienced a deep slump during 2011--2020 in its evolution process. Altmetrics grew to dominate the Webometrics specialty and brought it to a sharp increase during 2016--2020.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Author co-citation analysis (ACA) is effective in revealing intellectual structures of research fields. Most related studies used term-based methods to identify individual research topics but did not examine the interrelationships between these topics or the overall structure of the field. The few studies that did discuss the overall structure paid little attention to the effect of changes to the source journals on the results. The present study does not have these problems and continues the long history of benchmark contributions to a better understanding of the information science field using ACA.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Classifying scientific articles, patents, and other documents according to the relevant research topics is an important task, which enables a variety of functionalities, such as categorising documents in digital libraries, monitoring and predicting research trends, and recommending papers relevant to one or more topics. In this paper, we present the latest version of the CSO Classifier (v3.0), an unsupervised approach for automatically classifying research papers according to the Computer Science Ontology (CSO), a comprehensive taxonomy of research areas in the field of Computer Science. The CSO Classifier takes as input the textual components of a research paper (usually title, abstract, and keywords) and returns a set of research topics drawn from the ontology. This new version includes a new component for discarding outlier topics and offers improved scalability. We evaluated the CSO Classifier on a gold standard of manually annotated articles, demonstrating a significant improvement over alternative methods. We also present an overview of applications adopting the CSO Classifier and describe how it can be adapted to other fields.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Uncovering the driving forces, strategic landscapes, and evolutionary mechanisms of China's research systems is attracting rising interest around the globe. One topic of interest is to understand the problem-solving patterns in China's research systems now and in the future. Targeting a set of high-quality research articles published by Chinese researchers between 2009 and 2018, and indexed in the Essential Science Indicators database, we developed an intelligent bibliometrics-based methodology for identifying the problem-solving patterns from scientific documents. Specifically, science overlay maps incorporating link prediction were used to profile China's disciplinary interactions and predict potential cross-disciplinary innovation at a macro level. We proposed a function incorporating word embedding techniques to represent subjects, actions, and objects (SAO) retrieved from combined titles and abstracts into vectors and constructed a tri-layer SAO network to visualize SAOs and their semantic relationships. Then, at a micro level, we developed network analytics for identifying problems and solutions from the SAO network, and recommending potential solutions for existing problems. Empirical insights derived from this study provide clues to understand China's research strengths and the science policies underlying them, along with the key research problems and solutions that Chinese researchers are focusing on now and might pursue in the future.},

	abstract = {Traditional topic research divides similar topics into the same cluster according to clustering or classification from the perspective of users, which ignores the deep relationship within and between topics. In this paper, topic analysis is achieved from the perspective of the topic network. Based on the initial core topics obtained by the keyword importance and affinity propagation clustering, co-occurrence time series between topics are constructed according to time sequence and topic frequency. Subsequence segments of each topic co-occurrence time series are divided by sliding windows, and the similarity between subsequence segments is calculated. Based on the topic similarity matrix, the topic network is constructed. The topic network is divided according to the community detection algorithm, which realizes the topic re-clustering and reveals the deep relationship between topics in fine-grained. The results show there is no relationship between topic center representation and keyword popularity, and topics with a wide range of concepts are more likely to become topic network centers. The proposed approach takes into account the influence of time factors on topic analysis, which not only expands the analysis in the field of topic research but also improves the quality of topic research.},

	abstract = {The wealth of opinions expressed by users on micro-blogging sites can be beneficial for product manufacturers of service providers, as they can gain insights about certain aspects of their products or services. The most common approach for analyzing text opinion is using machine learning. However. opinion data are often imbalanced, e.g. the number of positive sentiments heavily outnumbered the negative sentiments. Ensemble technique, which combines multiple classification algorithms to make decisions, can be used to tackle imbalanced data to learn from multiple balanced datasets. The decision of ensemble is obtained by combining the decisions of individual classifiers using a certain rule. Therefore, rule selection is an important factor in ensemble design. This research aims to investigate the best decision combination rule for imbalanced text data. Multinomial Na{\~A}¯ve Bayes, Complement Na{\~A}¯ve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Softmax Regression are used for base classifiers, and max, min, product, sum, vote, and meta-classifier rules are considered for decision combination. The experiment is done on several Twitter datasets. From the experimental results, it is found that the Softmax Regression ensemble with meta-classifier combination rule performs the best in all except in one dataset. However, it is also found that the training of the Softmax Regression ensemble requires intensive computational resources.},

@article{rustam_2019_the_global_kernel_k_means_clustering_algorithm_for_cerebral_infarction_classification,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Cerebral infarction is the death of neurons, glia cells and blood vessel systems caused by a lack of oxygen and nutrients. This situation is often called storke. Common causes of neuron damage are hypoxia, which is caused by impaired blood flow, reduced oxygen pressure in blood circulation, toxins, and hypoglycemia which can result in the same morphological changes as morphological changes in hypoxia. Hypoxia is reduced oxygen pressure in the alveoli, resulting in hypoxemia which can cause hypoxic brain tissue. The initial stage of ischemic neurons is characterized by the formation of micro vacuolization, which is characterized by the size of the cells that are still normal or slightly reduced, the nucleus shrinks slightly, vacuoles occur in the perikaryon region. This micro vacuole can be found in neurons in hippokamus and cortical 5-15 minutes after hypoxia. The final sign of cell damage due to ischemia is characterized by the nucleus becoming pyknotic and fragmented. To classify cerebral infarction, the author uses the global k-means clustering algorithm as a classification method that shows that the method has good accuracy, good memory, and good precision in classifying cerebral infarction. In this proposed method, the global kernel k-means clustering algorithm is an extension of the standard k-means clustering algorithm and has been used to identify or classify clusters that are non-linearly separated in space input. This method adds one cluster at each stage through a global search process consisting of several k-means kernel executions from the appropriate initialization. Therefore, this method can make good classification accuracy. In particular, this achieves classification accuracy of up to 78\% for the highest accuracy.},

@article{cadavid_2021_mapping_the_research_landscape_for_the_motorcycle_market_policies_sustainability_as_a_trend___a_systematic_literature_review,
	abstract = {The motorcycle market has experienced an upward trend. That growth brings along mobility, accidents, and environment-related issues; nevertheless, there is a scarcity of literature on evaluating the impact of motorcycle market policies. Consequently, it has been challenging for researchers and policymakers to develop evidence-based strategies to promote or control the growth of this market. This paper aims to review and analyze the scientific literature about motorcycle market policies, using tech-mining techniques and a cluster analysis of keywords, to provide insights about the most relevant world trends in this research area. For this purpose, the bibliographic information of publications in the field was retrieved from the Scopus database. As a result, three thematic clusters (sustainability, mobility, and electric motorcycles) were identified and explained. According to our findings, greenhouse gas emissions, sustainability, environmental impact, and developing countries are the hot research topics. The research leader countries on said topics are the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This study can, therefore, be used as a reference to define a future research agenda in the area. Consequently, it permits researchers and policymakers to identify trending topics and gaps in knowledge, as a baseline to include motorcycles in sustainable and affordable transport systems design.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Purpose
              We proposed a method to represent scientific papers by a complex network, which combines the approaches of neural and complex networks.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Its novelty is representing a paper by a word branch, which carries the sequential structure of words in sentences. The branches are generated by the attention mechanism in deep learning models. We connected those branches at the positions of their common words to generate networks, called word-attention networks, and then detect their communities, defined as topics.
            
            
              Findings
              Those detected topics can carry the sequential structure of words in sentences, represent the intra- and inter-sentential dependencies among words, and reveal the roles of words playing in them by network indexes.
            
            
              Research limitations
              The parameter setting of our method may depend on practical data. Thus it needs human experience to find proper settings.
            
            
              Practical implications
              Our method is applied to the papers of the PNAS, where the discipline designations provided by authors are used as the golden labels of papers' topics.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This empirical study shows that the proposed method outperforms the Latent Dirichlet Allocation and is more stable.},

Our simple bibliographic analysis showed that at least 15 LIS journal papers used word embeddings. These 15 papers were briefly described under the following categories: knowledge extraction and visualization from scholarly data, classification in scholarly data, and others that focus on more general corpora.},

However, it requires a large amount of labeled patent data as a training set, which is difficult to obtain due to various constraints. This study proposes a novel approach that integrates data augmentation and deep learning methods, which overcome the problem of lacking training samples when applying deep learning to forecast emerging technologies. First, a sample data set was constructed using Gartner's hype cycle and multiple patent features. Second, a generative adversarial network was used to generate many synthetic samples (data augmentation) to expand the scale of the sample data set. Finally, a deep neural network classifier was trained with the augmented data set to forecast emerging technologies, and it could predict up to 77\% of the emerging technologies in a given year with high precision. This approach was used to forecast emerging technologies in Gartner's hype cycles for 2017 based on patent data from 2000 to 2016. Four out of six of the emerging technologies were forecasted correctly, showing the accuracy and precision of the proposed approach. This approach enables deep learning to forecast emerging technologies with limited training samples.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to trace the knowledge diffusion patterns between the publications of top journals of computer science and physics to uncover the knowledge diffusion trends.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The degree of information flow between the disciplines is a measure of entropy and received citations. The entropy gives the uncertainty in the citation distribution of a journal; the more a journal is involved in spreading information or affected by other journals, its entropy increases. The citations from outside category give the degree of inter-disciplinarity index as the percentage of references made to papers of another discipline. In this study, the topic-related diffusion across computer science and physics scholarly communication network is studied to examine how the same research topic is studied and shared across disciplines.
            
            
              Findings
              For three indicators, Shannon entropy, citations outside category (COC) and research keywords, a global view of information flow at the journal level between both disciplines is obtained. It is observed that computer science mostly cites knowledge published in physics journals as compared to physics journals that cite knowledge within the field.
            
            
              Originality/value
              To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that traces knowledge diffusion trends between computer science and physics publications at journal level using entropy, COC and research keywords.},

@article{wang_2020_a_topic_based_patent_analytics_approach_for_exploring_technological_trends_in_smart_manufacturing,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Smart manufacturing can lead to disruptive changes in production technologies and business models in the manufacturing industry. This paper aims to identify technological topics in smart manufacturing by using patent data, investigating technological trends and exploring potential opportunities.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling technique was used to extract latent technological topics, and the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was used to analyze the relative emergence levels of the topics. Topic value and topic competitive analyses were developed to evaluate each topic's potential value and identify technological positions of competing firms, respectively.
            
            
              Findings
              A total of 14 topics were extracted from the collected patent data and several fast growth and high-value topics were identified, such as smart connection, cyber-physical systems (CPSs), manufacturing data analytics and powder bed fusion additive manufacturing. Several leading firms apply broad R\&D emphasis across a variety of technological topics, while others focus on a few technological topics.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The developed methodology can help firms identify important technological topics in smart manufacturing for making their R\&D investment decisions. Firms can select appropriate technology strategies depending on the topic's emergence position in the topic strategy matrix.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Previous research studies have not analyzed the maturity levels of technological topics. The topic-based patent analytics approach can complement previous studies. In addition, this study provides a multi-valuation framework for exploring technological opportunities, thus providing valuable information that supports a more robust understanding of the technology landscape of smart manufacturing.},

@article{ghafouri_2022_influence_maximization_im_in_complex_networks_with_limited_visibility_using_statistical_methods,
	abstract = {A social network (SN) is a social structure consisting of a group representing the interaction between them. SNs have recently been widely used and, subsequently, have become suitable and popular platforms for product promotion and information diffusion. People in an SN directly influence each other's interests and behavior. One of the most important problems in SNs is to find people who can have the maximum influence on other nodes in the network in a cascade manner if they are chosen as the seed nodes of a network diffusion scenario. Influential diffusers are people who, if they are chosen as the seed set in a publishing issue in the network, that network will have the most people who have learned about that diffused entity. This is a well-known problem in literature known as influence maximization (IM) problem. Although it has been proven that this is an NP-complete problem and does not have a solution in polynomial time, it has been argued that it has the properties of sub modular functions and, therefore, can be solved using a greedy algorithm. Most of the methods proposed to improve this complexity are based on the assumption that the entire graph is visible. However, this assumption does not hold for many real-world graphs. This study is conducted to extend current maximization methods with link prediction techniques to pseudo-visibility graphs. To this end, a graph generation method called the exponential random graph model (ERGM) is used for link prediction. The proposed method is tested using the data from the Snap dataset of Stanford University. According to the experimental tests, the proposed method is efficient on real-world graphs.},

The authors performed a social network analysis on a network including 13,270 Twitter users and 24,354 relationships to reveal users' betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, in-degree, and out-degree centralities before hypothesis testing. They applied a path analysis including users' centrality measures and their user-related features. The path analysis discovered that the factors of the number of people a user follows, the number of followers a user has, and the number of years since a user had his account increased a user's in-degree connections in the network. Together with the user's out-degree connections along with in-degree links, they pushed a user to have a strategic place in the network. They also implemented a multi-group analysis to find whether the impact of these factors showed differences specifically in replies to, mentions, and retweets networks.},

	abstract = {Because of the numerous applications domains in which social media networks can be used, the huge volume of data and information uploaded by them is gaining significant interest. Publishing allows consumers to express their thoughts on products and services. Some feedbacks could also influence other users on those things. Therefore, extracting and identifying influencers from social media networks, also profiling their product perceptions and preferences, is critical for marketers to use efficient viral marketing and recommendation strategies. Our major goal in this research is to find the best machine learning model for characterizing influencers on social media networks. However, to achieve this objective, our strategy revolves around applying the PageRank algorithm to profile influential nodes throughout the social media network graph. The results of our experiment showed that the correlation is always different when adding a new parameter to machine learning models, also to determine the suitable model for our needs. In any event, the experiment outcomes are critical and significant to profiling influencers from social media platforms.},

@article{tidke_2021_a_social_network_based_approach_to_identify_and_rank_influential_nodes_for_smart_city,
	abstract = {Purpose
              In online social network analysis, the problem of identification and ranking of influential nodes based on their prominence has attracted immense attention from researchers and practitioners. Identification and ranking of influential nodes is a challenging problem using Twitter, as data contains heterogeneous features such as tweets, likes, mentions and retweets. The purpose of this paper is to perform correlation between various features, evaluation metrics, approaches and results to validate selection of features as well as results. In addition, the paper uses well-known techniques to find topical authority and sentiments of influential nodes that help smart city governance and to make importance decisions while understanding the various perceptions of relevant influential nodes.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The tweets fetched using Twitter API are stored in Neo4j to generate graph-based relationships between various features of Twitter data such as followers, mentions and retweets. In this paper, consensus approach based on Twitter data using heterogeneous features has been proposed based on various features such as like, mentions and retweets to generate individual list of top-k influential nodes based on each features.
            
            
              Findings
              The heterogeneous features are meant for integrating to accomplish identification and ranking tasks with low computational complexity, i.e. O(n), which is suitable for large-scale online social network with better accuracy than baselines.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Identified influential nodes can act as source in making public decisions and their opinion give insights to urban governance bodies such as municipal corporation as well as similar organization responsible for smart urban governance and smart city development.},

Sentiment analysis using Linguistics Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC2015, Pennebaker et al., 2015) software indicates that tweets related to gifted education have a mix of positive and negative emotive tone. The qualitative analyses suggest that gifted education professionals and parents engage in Twitter in similar ways to what has been described in past research: to share interesting articles and videos, to discuss current issues, promote one's ideas, and seek opportunities.},

@article{fikriyah_2022_identify_user_behavior_based_on_tweet_type_on_twitter_platform_using_mean_shift_clustering,
	abstract = {Twitter is a social media where users often get information from various fields. There are many problems with Twitter. For example, in Indonesia's political field, discussing the performance of the President of Indonesia and his staff who are not good, students and the public hold demonstrations in DKI Jakarta. They want the President of Indonesia to step down from office. When the problem is trending, some users have positive (praise) and negative (blasphemous) behavior, which is interesting to discuss in this study. Before the method stage, data preprocessing is carried out so that the data to be used becomes more efficient. Word weighting is also done using the TF-IDF Vectorizer. Then, the clustering method with the Mean Shift algorithm is applied to identify user behavior based on the type of tweet. This method can find information from a vast data set in a short time. Based on this algorithm, the results obtained are 67 clusters from the Mean Shift algorithm. From a total of 67 clusters obtained, 5 clusters were taken to identify user behavior. User behavior in clusters 0, 2, 3, and 4 is negative because it discusses the people who want the President of the Republic of Indonesia to resign from his position immediately. Meanwhile, user behavior in cluster 1 is positive because the topics discussed only information that the people of Lampung are already in Jakarta.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Quantifying the nodal spreading abilities and identifying the potential influential spreaders has been one of the most engaging topics recently, which is essential and beneficial to facilitate information flow and ensure the stabilization operations of social networks. However, most of the existing algorithms just consider a fundamental quantification through combining a certain attribute of the nodes to measure the nodes' importance. Moreover, reaching a balance between the accuracy and the simplicity of these algorithms is difficult. In order to accurately identify the potential super-spreaders, the CumulativeRank algorithm is proposed in the present study. This algorithm combines the local and global performances of nodes for measuring the nodal spreading abilities. In local performances, the proposed algorithm considers both the direct influence from the node's neighbourhoods and the indirect influence from the nearest and the next nearest neighbours. On the other hand, in the global performances, the concept of the tenacity is introduced to assess the node's prominent position in maintaining the network connectivity. Extensive experiments carried out with the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model on real-world social networks demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the comparison of the proposed algorithm with the existing well-known algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm has lower time complexity and can be applicable to large-scale networks.},

@article{abhishek_and_srivastava_2021_mapping_the_influence_of_influencer_marketing_a_bibliometric_analysis,
	abstract = {Purpose
              The advent of social media has led to the emergence of influencers and the domain of influencer marketing (IM). Despite being a popular and evolving research domain, it still lacks a comprehensive and systematic bibliometric analysis in the field. This study attempts to fill this critical gap by mapping the influence of IM to understand the intellectual structure and propose a future research agenda for scholars working in the domain.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The authors have used VOSviewer and Biblioshiny packages for conducting a variety of analyses such as citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, keyword analysis and three-field plot analysis.
            
            
              Findings
              The main findings include identifying six clusters in the domain, i.e. ``mechanism of IM,'' ``measuring the impact of IM,'' ``persuasive cues in IM,'' ``likability factors of influencers,'' ``authenticity of influencers'' and ``understanding followers.'' Future research guidelines have been proposed in each of the six clusters, followed by research and managerial implications, conclusion and limitations.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study is probably the first attempt at providing a comprehensive bibliometric analysis in the domain using a combination of VOSviewer and Biblioshiny packages.},

@article{kustudic_2021_identifying_communication_topologies_on_twitter,
	abstract = {Social networks are known for their decentralization and democracy. Each individual has a chance to participate and influence any discussion. Even with all the freedom, people's behavior falls under patterns that are observed in numerous situations. In this paper, we propose a methodology that defines and searches for common communication patterns in topical networks on Twitter. We analyze clusters according to four traits: number of nodes the cluster has, their degree and betweenness centrality values, number of node types, and whether the cluster is open or closed. We find that cluster structures can be defined as (a) fixed, meaning that they are repeated across datasets/topics following uniform rules, or (b) variable if they follow an underlying rule regardless of their size. This approach allows us to classify 90\% of all conversation clusters, with the number varying by topic. An increase in cluster size often results in difficulties finding topological shape rules; however, these types of clusters tend to exhibit rules regarding their node relationships in the form of centralization. Most individuals do not enter large-scale discussions on Twitter, meaning that the simplicity of communication clusters implies repetition. In general, power laws apply for the influencer connection distribution (degree centrality) even in topical networks.},

@article{zhang_2021_assessing_the_structural_vulnerability_of_online_social_networks_in_empirical_data,
	abstract = {Assessing the structural vulnerability of online social networks has been one of the most engaging topics recently, which is quite essential and beneficial to holding the network connectivity and facilitating information flow, but most of the existing vulnerability assessment measures and the corresponding solutions fail to accurately reveal the global damage done to the network. In order to accurately measure the vulnerability of networks, an invulnerability index based on the concept of improved tenacity is proposed in the present study. Compared with existing measurements, the new method does not measure a single property performance, such as giant component size or the number of components after destruction, but pays special attention to the potential equilibrium between the removal cost and the removal effect. Extensive experiments on real-world social networks demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, compared with results of attacks based on the different centrality indices, we found an individual node's prominence in a network is inherently related to the structural properties of network. In high centralized networks, the nodes with higher eigenvector are more important than the others in maintaining stability and connectivity. But in low centralized networks, the nodes with higher betweenness are more powerful than the others. In addition, the experimental results indicate that low centralized networks can tolerate high intentional attacks and has a better adaptability to attacks than high centralized networks.},

@article{weninggalih_2022_identify_user_behavior_based_on_tweet_type_on_twitter_platform_using_agglomerative_hierarchical_clustering,
	abstract = {Information dissemination can occur through any media, including social media. One of the social media that has become a forum for disseminating information is Twitter. Through user-uploaded tweets, not a few comments are positive (praise/support) or negative (blasphemy), depending on the tweet. This study chooses politics as a discussion. Data crawling was carried out to obtain a dataset and raise the topic of Joko Widodo as a President of Indonesia, whose work is considered poor by the public, so they want him to resign immediately. This makes it interesting because we can identify user behavior from tweets about the topic. The choice of this topic was based on a lot of users who discussed it, so it was trending on Twitter. Preprocessing stage aims to eliminate missing values. After that, it then goes through the feature extraction process. The agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm of the clustering method is applied in this research. This algorithm can directly set how many clusters to facilitate the clustering process. The result obtained 3 clusters with different user behavior. Negative user behavior is found in cluster 1, while positive user behavior is found in cluster 2.},

The results identify three categories of accounts that linked Omar to clusters of accounts that shaped the Islamophobia/xenophobic narrative: Influencers, Amplifiers, and Icons. This cadre of accounts played a synergistic and disproportionate role in raising the level of hate speech as a vast network containing a high proportion of apparently inauthentic accounts magnified the messages generated by a handful of provocateurs.},

Concretely, Social Influence can be described as the power or even the ability of a person to yet influence the thoughts as well as the actions of other users. So, User Influence stands as a value that depends on the interest of the followers of a concrete user (via retweets, replies, mentions, favorites, etc.). This paper focuses on identifying such phenomena on the Twitter graph and on presenting a novel methodology for characterizing Twitter Influential Users. The novelty of our approach lies in the fact that we have incorporated a set of features for characterizing social media authors, including both nodal and topical metrics, along with new features concerning temporal aspects of user participation on the topic. We have also implemented cluster-based fusion techniques in order to retrieve result lists for the ranking of top influential users. Hence, results show that the proposed implementations and methodology can assist in identifying influential users, that play a dominant role in information diffusion.},

@article{zak_2020_the_role_of_influencers_in_the_consumer_decision_making_process,
	abstract = {In the contemporary globalised markets opinion leaders play a vital role in the process of the purchasing decision-making of consumers. Thanks to their individual skills, specific knowledge or their personality, opinion leaders have a direct or indirect influence on the attitudes and decisions of consumers. In the contemporary globalised marketing using social media, this role is taken over by the influencers who affect consumers with their thoughts, attitudes and opinions and thus, significantly influence trends in demand for particular products. Over the recent years, influencer marketing has become increasingly popular, representing a specific type of social media marketing. The aim of this scientific contribution is the systematization of knowledge about the position and roles of influencers as opinion leaders in the social media environment in order to identify their typology, influence factors and the intensity of their impact on consumer decision making process, based on the comparison of knowledge from the results of global research studies and the quantitative online research study processed by authors. The findings of the survey showed that the promotion of some products through influencers may be more advantageous than others. Influencers will have the greatest impact when buying clothes, shoes, cosmetics and, surprisingly, services. Meanwhile, people rely heavily on other factors to buy food, jewellery and electronics, but it is not excluded that influencer marketing could affect them as well.},

	abstract = {Social media has become a popular platform to post or share personal information, opinion, photos, videos, etc. Detection of influential users is a significant problem in information diffusion or propagation. Previous researches find influential users based on follower or retweet relationships and centrality measurement approaches. In this paper, influential users are detected by network topology that was obtained from communication relationships among users, link analysis approach, and user's profile features. The proposed approach aims to detect trending topic influencers. Firstly, communication relationships namely retweet, mention, and reply between users in a trending topic are extracted and a trending topic graph is constructed. Secondly, influential users are detected using a link analysis approach combined with the ability of users' profile features. The performance of the system can be proved to compare with influencer detection methods. The experimental result shows that the trending topic influencers can detect using the interaction relationships and user's features.},

	abstract = {Based upon the 55 days of lockdown that occurred during the Covid\_19 disaster, the aim of this article is to answer to the following research question: ``how can we characterize influencers in social networks?''. Analyzing more than 1.6 million of tweets, we propose a matrix that can be used to characterize an influencer. This matrix has 2 dimensions on one hand the five courses of actions an influencer can use and on the other hand the 3 types of motivation he has got. Regarding the methodology we used R and a qualitative content analysis and provided our scripts. This research is a part of the ``lockdown lab'' project.},

@article{wu_2022_a_survey_on_temporal_network_dynamics_with_incomplete_data,
	abstract = {{\textless}abstract{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}With the development of complex network theory, many phenomena on complex networks, such as infectious disease transmission, information spreading and transportation management, can be explained by temporal network dynamics, to reveal the evolution of the real world. Due to the failure of equipment for collecting data, human subjectivity, and false decisions made by machines when the high accuracy is required, data from temporal networks is usually incomplete, which makes the samples unrepresentative and the model analysis more challenging. This survey concentrates on the pre-processing strategies of incomplete data and overviews two categories of methods on data imputation and prediction, respectively. According to whether each layer in temporal networks has the coupling process, this survey overviews the dynamic modeling approaches in terms of both a single process and coupling processes on complex temporal networks. Moreover, for complex temporal networks with incomplete data, this survey summarizes various characteristic analysis methods, which concentrate on critical nodes identification, network reconstruction, network recoverity, and criticality. Finally, some future directions are discussed for temporal networks dynamics with incomplete data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/abstract{\textgreater}},

@article{pattnaik_2022_perspectives_of_non_expert_users_on_cyber_security_and_privacy_an_analysis_of_online_discussions_on_twitter,
	abstract = {Current research on users` perspectives of cyber security and privacy related to traditional and smart devices at home is very active, but the focus is often more on specific modern devices such as mobile and smart IoT devices in a home context. In addition, most were based on smaller-scale empirical studies such as online surveys and interviews. We endeavour to fill these research gaps by conducting a larger-scale study based on a real-world dataset of 413,985 tweets posted by non-expert users on Twitter in six months of three consecutive years (January and February in 2019, 2020 and 2021). Two machine learning-based classifiers were developed to identify the 413,985 tweets. We analysed this dataset to understand non-expert users` cyber security and privacy perspectives, including the yearly trend and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We applied topic modelling, sentiment analysis and qualitative analysis of selected tweets in the dataset, leading to various interesting findings. For instance, we observed a 54\% increase in non-expert users` tweets on cyber security and/or privacy related topics in 2021, compared to before the start of global COVID-19 lockdowns (January 2019 to February 2020). We also observed an increased level of help-seeking tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis revealed a diverse range of topics discussed by non-expert users across the three years, including VPNs, Wi-Fi, smartphones, laptops, smart home devices, financial security, and security and privacy issues involving different stakeholders. Overall negative sentiment was observed across almost all topics non-expert users discussed on Twitter in all the three years. Our results confirm the multi-faceted nature of non-expert users` perspectives on cyber security and privacy and call for more holistic, comprehensive and nuanced research on different facets of such perspectives.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Text preprocessing is not only an essential step to prepare the corpus for modeling but also a key area that directly affects the natural language processing (NLP) application results. For instance, precise tokenization increases the accuracy of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and retaining multiword expressions improves reasoning and machine translation. The text corpus needs to be appropriately preprocessed before it is ready to serve as the input to computer models. The preprocessing requirements depend on both the nature of the corpus and the NLP application itself, that is, what researchers would like to achieve from analyzing the data. Conventional text preprocessing practices generally suffice, but there exist situations where the text preprocessing needs to be customized for better analysis results. Hence, we discuss the pros and cons of several common text preprocessing methods: removing formatting, tokenization, text normalization, handling punctuation, removing stopwords, stemming and lemmatization, n-gramming, and identifying multiword expressions. Then, we provide examples of text datasets which require special preprocessing and how previous researchers handled the challenge. We expect this article to be a starting guideline on how to select and fine-tune text preprocessing methods.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Extremism has grown as a global problem for society in recent years, especially after the apparition of movements such as jihadism. This and other extremist groups have taken advantage of different approaches, such as the use of Social Media, to spread their ideology, promote their acts and recruit followers. The extremist discourse, therefore, is reflected on the language used by these groups. Natural language processing (NLP) provides a way of detecting this type of content, and several authors make use of it to describe and discriminate the discourse held by these groups, with the final objective of detecting and preventing its spread. Following this approach, this survey aims to review the contributions of NLP to the field of extremism research, providing the reader with a comprehensive picture of the state of the art of this research area. The content includes a first conceptualization of the term extremism, the elements that compose an extremist discourse and the differences with other terms. After that, a review description and comparison of the frequently used NLP techniques is presented, including how they were applied, the insights they provided, the most frequently used NLP software tools, descriptive and classification applications, and the availability of datasets and data sources for research. Finally, research questions are approached and answered with highlights from the review, while future trends, challenges and directions derived from these highlights are suggested towards stimulating further research in this exciting research area.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The communication of corporate social responsibility (CSR) highlights the behavior of the business toward CSR and their framework of sustainable development (SD), thus helping policymakers understand the role businesses play with respect to the 2030 Agenda. Despite its importance, this is still a relatively underexamined and emerging topic. In our paper, we focus on what businesses communicate about CSR through social media and how this relates to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We identified the topics discussed on Twitter, their evolution over time, and the differences across sectors. We applied the structural topic model (STM) algorithm, which allowed us to estimate the model, including document-level metadata (time and sector). This model proved to be a powerful tool for topic detection and the estimation of the effects of time and sector on the discussion proportion of the topics. Indeed, we found that the topics were well identified overall, and the model allowed catching signals from the data. We derived CSR communication indexes directly from the topic model (TM) results and propose the use of dissimilarity and homogeneity indexes to describe the communication mix and highlight differences and identify clusters.},

@article{kars_unluoglu_2022_migrants_as_dissonant_harmony_seekers_and_migrant_life_in_foam,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Migration of the Turkish new middle-class -- high-skilled, well-educated, young professionals -- has been growing in recent years. This paper explores their migration experience and discusses the role of physical and virtual bubbles in the formation of transnational communities and processes of adjustment to a new place.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This paper is based on a qualitative inquiry collecting data via semi-structured interviews with 18 London-based Turkish migrants and a digital ethnographic study of three Facebook groups that bring together the Turkish migrant community in Richmond, London.
            
            
              Findings
              Findings indicate that the migration of the new middle class differs conceptually from existing typologies. The paper proposes the concept of ``dissonant harmony-seekers'' and elaborates on their interactions to demonstrate that, in the Internet age, the traditional image of migrants living in isolated localised bubbles is no longer accurate. Findings also indicate a pragmatic and functional engagement with the bubbles, with migrants sporadically interacting with the bubbles to meet their individual needs in information, education and employment. 
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper contributes to the literature with the concept of dissonant harmony-seekers, which will gain more visibility in a world where the trend of democratic decline and rising authoritarianism will motivate a migratory move for people who confront a moral dissociation from the civil order in their homeland. The engagement of dissonant harmony-seekers with migrant communities challenges the conventional thinking that social identity is central to creating and maintaining bubbles. The other contribution of the paper to the literature is the metaphor of ``foam'' to capture the ephemeral and fugacious nature of the dynamics of migrant communities and practices.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The increasingly growing scale of modern computing infrastructures solicits more ingenious and automatic solutions to their management. Our work focuses on file transfer failures within the Worldwide Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid and proposes a pipeline to support distributed data management operations by suggesting potential issues to investigate. Specifically, we adopt an unsupervised learning approach leveraging Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning tools to automatically parse error messages and group similar failures. The results are presented in the form of a summary table containing the most common textual patterns and time evolution charts. This approach has two main advantages. First, the joint elaboration of the error string and the transfer's source/destination enables more informative and compact troubleshooting, as opposed to inspecting each site and checking unique messages separately. As a by-product, this also reduces the number of errors to check by some orders of magnitude (from unique error strings to unique categories or patterns). Second, the time evolution plots allow operators to immediately filter out secondary issues (e.g. transient or in resolution) and focus on the most serious problems first (e.g. escalating failures). As a preliminary assessment, we compare our results with the Global Grid User Support ticketing system, showing that most of our suggestions are indeed real issues (direct association), while being able to cover 89\% of reported incidents (inverse relationship).},

@article{narhari_2021_automated_diagnosis_of_diabetic_retinopathy_enabled_by_optimized_thresholding_based_blood_vessel_segmentation_and_hybrid_classifier,
	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Objectives
              The focus of this paper is to introduce an automated early Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) detection scheme from colour fundus images through enhanced segmentation and classification strategies by analyzing blood vessels.
            
            
              Methods
              The occurrence of DR is increasing from the past years, impacting the eyes due to a sudden rise in the glucose level of blood. All over the world, half of the people who are under age 70 are severely suffered from diabetes. The patients who are affected by DR will lose their vision during the absence of early recognition of DR and appropriate treatment. To decrease the growth and occurrence of loss of vision, the early detection and timely treatment of DR are desirable. At present, deep learning models have presented better performance using retinal images for DR detection. In this work, the input retinal fundus images are initially subjected to pre-processing that undergoes contrast enhancement by Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and average filtering. Further, the optimized binary thresholding-based segmentation is done for blood vessel segmentation. For the segmented image, Tri-level Discrete Level Decomposition (Tri-DWT) is performed to decompose it. In the feature extraction phase, Local Binary Pattern (LBP), and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCMs) are extracted. Next, the classification of images is done through the combination of two algorithms, one is Neural Network (NN), and the other Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The extracted features are subjected to NN, and the tri-DWT-based segmented image is subjected to CNN. Both the segmentation and classification phases are enhanced by the improved meta-heuristic algorithm called Fitness Rate-based Crow Search Algorithm (FR-CSA), in which few parameters are optimized for attaining maximum detection accuracy.
            
            
              Results
              The proposed DR detection model was implemented in MATLAB 2018a, and the analysis was done using three datasets, HRF, Messidor, and DIARETDB.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The developed FR-CSA algorithm has the best detection accuracy in diagnosing DR.},

@article{fraguas_sanchez_2022_actively_targeted_nanomedicines_in_breast_cancer_from_pre_clinal_investigation_to_clinic,
	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed tumors and the second leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. The use of nanosystems specifically targeted to tumor cells (active targeting) can be an excellent therapeutic tool to improve and optimize current chemotherapy for this type of neoplasm, since they make it possible to reduce the toxicity and, in some cases, increase the efficacy of antineoplastic drugs. Currently, there are 14 nanomedicines that have reached the clinic for the treatment of breast cancer, 4 of which are already approved (Kadcyla{\textregistered}, Enhertu{\textregistered}, Trodelvy{\textregistered}, and Abraxane{\textregistered}). Most of these nanomedicines are antibody--drug conjugates. In the case of HER-2-positive breast cancer, these conjugates (Kadcyla{\textregistered}, Enhertu{\textregistered}, Trastuzumab-duocarmycin, RC48, and HT19-MMAF) target HER-2 receptors, and incorporate maytansinoid, deruxtecan, duocarmicyn, or auristatins as antineoplastics. In TNBC these conjugates (Trodelvy{\textregistered}, Glembatumumab-Vedotin, Ladiratuzumab-vedotin, Cofetuzumab-pelidotin, and PF-06647263) are directed against various targets, in particular Trop-2 glycoprotein, NMB glycoprotein, Zinc transporter LIV-1, and Ephrin receptor-4, to achieve this selective accumulation, and include campthotecins, calicheamins, or auristatins as drugs. Apart from the antibody--drug conjugates, there are other active targeted nanosystems that have reached the clinic for the treatment of these tumors such as Abraxane{\textregistered} and Nab-rapamicyn (albumin nanoparticles entrapping placlitaxel and rapamycin respectively) and various liposomes (MM-302, C225-ILS-Dox, and MM-310) loaded with doxorubicin or docetaxel and coated with ligands targeted to Ephrin A2, EPGF, or HER-2 receptors. In this work, all these active targeted nanomedicines are discussed, analyzing their advantages and disadvantages over conventional chemotherapy as well as the challenges involved in their lab to clinical translation. In addition, examples of formulations developed and evaluated at the preclinical level are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Facial expression recognition (FER) is the process of identifying human expressions. People vary in their accuracy at recognizing the emotions of others. Use of technology to help people with emotion recognition is a relatively important research area. Various works have been conducted on automating the recognition of facial expressions. The main intent of this paper is to plan for the FER model with the aid of intelligent techniques. The proposed models consist of steps like data collection, face detection, optimized feature extraction and emotion recognition. Initially, the standard benchmark facial emotion dataset is collected, and it is subjected to face detection. The optimized scale-invariant feature transform (OSIFT) is adopted for feature extraction, in which the key points that are giving unique information are optimized by the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm. Two meta-heuristic algorithms like spotted hyena optimization and beetle swarm optimization (BSO) are merged to form the proposed spotted hyena-based BSO (SH-BSO). Also, the local tri-directional pattern is extracted, which is further combined with optimized SIFT. Here, the proposed SH-BSO is utilized for optimizing the number of hidden neurons of both deep neural network and convolutional neural network in such a way that the recognition accuracy could attain maximum.},

@article{egger_2021_identifying_hidden_semantic_structures_in_instagram_data_a_topic_modelling_comparison,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Intrigued by the methodological challenges emerging from text complexity, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of different topic modelling algorithms based on Instagram textual data.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              By taking Instagram posts captioned with \#darktourism as the study context, this research applies latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), correlation explanation (CorEx), and non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to uncover tourist experiences.
            
            
              Findings
              CorEx outperforms LDA and NMF by classifying emerging dark sites and activities into 17 distinct topics. The results of LDA appear homogeneous and overlapping, whereas the extracted topics of NMF are not specific enough to gain deep insights.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study assesses different topic modelling algorithms for knowledge extraction in the highly heterogeneous tourism industry. The findings unfold the complexity of analysing short-text social media data and strengthen the use of CorEx in analysing Instagram content.

            语意大解密：主题模型的比较
            
              研究目的
              基于对文本复杂性的兴趣, 本研究以Instagram文本数据为基准, 旨在比较不同主题建模的算法的有效性。
            
            
              研究方法
              本研究以标有 \#darktourism的Instagram帖子作为背景, 评估直观理解（LDA）, 相关解释（CorEx）和非负矩阵分解（NMF）在分析与黑暗观光相关的帖子的实用性。
            
            
              研究结果
              CorEx分析出17个新兴的黑暗景点和活动, 亦胜过LDA和NMF。虽然LDA能探讨出较多的主题数, 但它们的内容几乎重复。同样的, 尽管NMF适用于短文本数据, 但它提取出主题相当笼统且不够具体。
            
            
              原创性
              透过将营销和数据科学学科相结合, 本研究为分析非结构化的文本奠定了基础, 并证实了CorEx在分析短文本社交媒体数据（如Instagram数据）中的效益。

              Resultados
              CorEx supera a LDA y NMF al clasificar los sitios y actividades oscuros emergentes en 17 temas distintos. Los resultados de LDA son homog{\'e}neos y se superponen, mientras que los temas extra{\'\i}dos de NMF no son lo suficientemente espec{\'\i}ficos como para obtener conocimientos profundos.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a text-mining framework to systematically identify vanishing or newly formed topics in highly interdisciplinary and diverse fields like cognitive science. We apply topic modeling via non-negative matrix factorization to cognitive science publications before and after 2012; this allows us to study how the field has changed since the revival of neural networks in the neighboring field of AI/ML. Our proposed method represents the two distinct sets of topics in an interpretable, common vector space, and uses an entropy-based measure to quantify topical shifts. Case studies on vanishing (e.g., connectionist/symbolic AI debate) and newly emerged (e.g., art and technology) topics are presented. Our framework can be applied to any field or any historical event considered to mark a major shift in thought. Such findings can help lead to more efficient and impactful scientific discoveries.},

	abstract = {The richness of social media data has opened a new avenue for social science research to gain insights into human behaviors and experiences. In particular, emerging data-driven approaches relying on topic models provide entirely new perspectives on interpreting social phenomena. However, the short, text-heavy, and unstructured nature of social media content often leads to methodological challenges in both data collection and analysis. In order to bridge the developing field of computational science and empirical social research, this study aims to evaluate the performance of four topic modeling techniques; namely latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), Top2Vec, and BERTopic. In view of the interplay between human relations and digital media, this research takes Twitter posts as the reference point and assesses the performance of different algorithms concerning their strengths and weaknesses in a social science context. Based on certain details during the analytical procedures and on quality issues, this research sheds light on the efficacy of using BERTopic and NMF to analyze Twitter data.},

The My-Trac application is dedicated to the research and development of these user-centered services to improve the multi-modal experience using various techniques. Among these techniques are preference extraction systems, which extract user information from social networks, such as Twitter. In this article, we present a system that allows to develop a profile of the preferences of each user, on the basis of the tweets published on their Twitter account. The system extracts the tweets from the profile and analyzes them using the proposed algorithms and returns the result in a document containing the categories and the degree of affinity that the user has with each category. In this way, the My-Trac application includes a recommender system where the user receives preference-based suggestions about activities or services on the route to be taken.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Citation analysis has been applied to map the landscape of scientific disciplines and to assess the impact of publications. However, it is limited in that it assumes all citations to be of equal weight. Doing away with this assumption could make such studies even more insightful. Current developments in this regard focus on the evaluation of the syntactic and semantic qualities of the text that surrounds citations. Still lacking, however, are computational techniques to unpack the thematic context in which citations appear. It is against this backdrop that we propose a text clustering approach to derive contextual aspects of individual citations and the relationship between cited and citing work in an automated and scalable fashion. The method reveals a focal publication's absorption and use within the scientific community. It can also facilitate impact assessments at all levels. In addition to analyzing individual publications, the method can also be extended to creating impact profiles for authors, institutions, disciplines, and regions. We illustrate our results based on a large corpus of full-text articles from the field of Information systems (IS) with the help of exemplary visualizations. In addition, we provide a case study, the scientific impact of the Technology acceptance model. This way, we not only show the usefulness of our method in comparison to existing techniques but also enhance the understanding of the field by providing an in-depth analysis of the absorption of a key IS theoretical base.},

@article{cheng_2020_tracking_disaster_footprints_with_social_streaming_data,
	abstract = {Social media has become an indispensable tool in the face of natural disasters due to its broad appeal and ability to quickly disseminate information. For instance, Twitter is an important source for disaster responders to search for (1) topics that have been identified as being of particular interest over time, i.e., common topics such as ``disaster rescue''; (2) new emerging themes of disaster-related discussions that are fast gathering in social media streams (Saha and Sindhwani 2012), i.e., distinct topics such as ``the latest tsunami destruction''. To understand the status quo and allocate limited resources to most urgent areas, emergency managers need to quickly sift through relevant topics generated over time and investigate their commonness and distinctiveness. A major obstacle to the effective usage of social media, however, is its massive amount of noisy and undesired data. Hence, a naive method, such as set intersection/difference to find common/distinct topics, is often not practical. To address this challenge, this paper studies a new topic tracking problem that seeks to effectively identify the common and distinct topics with social streaming data. The problem is important as it presents a promising new way to efficiently search for accurate information during emergency response. This is achieved by an online Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) scheme that conducts a faster update of latent factors, and a joint NMF technique that seeks the balance between the reconstruction error of topic identification and the losses induced by discovering common and distinct topics. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets collected during Hurricane Harvey and Florence reveal the effectiveness of our framework.},

@article{hu_2020_incremental_rapidly_grouping_aggregation_method_for_similar_web_news_headline,
	abstract = {Abstract
            With the popularity of the Internet, real-time web news has been extensively used in human daily life. Because of competition and repetitive reporting between the media, there may be multiple similar news reporting the same searing event, which may waste a lot of time for users to obtain and read the similar news. Hence, how to rapid aggregating similar news to help users obtain relevant news information accurately is a very meaningful and essential study. However, the accuracy of the existing aggregation method needs to be strengthened, and it not meet real-time incremental processing requirements.
            In this paper, rapid incremental aggregating a lot of similar news headlines are our main study targets. We proposed a novel Rapidly Grouping Aggregation (RGA) method. It carries out similar news headline aggregation via two core aspects --- Improved Jaro-Winkler (IJW) similarity calculation, normalized mapping and rapidly grouping aggregation. The IJW using hierarchical matching windows to enhance the performance of similarity calculation, and using the MD5 normalization strategy and the Group By function of the MongoDB database to carry out the similarity news headline rapidly grouping. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, the actual system application results show that the RGA method achieves higher performance on similar news headline aggregation tasks.},

@article{kang_2022_resilience_in_web_based_mental_health_communities_building_a_resilience_dictionary_with_semiautomatic_text_analysis,
	abstract = {Background
              Resilience is an accepted strengths-based concept that responds to change, adversity, and crises. This concept underpins both personal and community-based preventive approaches to mental health issues and shapes digital interventions. Online mental health peer-support forums have played a prominent role in enhancing resilience by providing accessible places for sharing lived experiences of mental issues and finding support. However, little research has been conducted on whether and how resilience is realized, hindering service providers' ability to optimize resilience outcomes.
            
            
              Objective
              This study aimed to create a resilience dictionary that reflects the characteristics and realization of resilience within online mental health peer-support forums. The findings can be used to guide further analysis and improve resilience outcomes in mental health forums through targeted moderation and management.
            
            
              Methods
              A semiautomatic approach to creating a resilience dictionary was proposed using topic modeling and qualitative content analysis. We present a systematic 4-phase analysis pipeline that preprocesses raw forum posts, discovers core themes, conceptualizes resilience indicators, and generates a resilience dictionary. Our approach was applied to a mental health forum run by SANE (Schizophrenia: A National Emergency) Australia, with 70,179 forum posts between 2018 and 2020 by 2357 users being analyzed.
            
            
              Results
              The resilience dictionary and taxonomy developed in this study, reveal how resilience indicators (ie, ``social capital,'' ``belonging,'' ``learning,'' ``adaptive capacity,'' and ``self-efficacy'') are characterized by themes commonly discussed in the forums; each theme's top 10 most relevant descriptive terms and their synonyms; and the relatedness of resilience, reflecting a taxonomy of indicators that are more comprehensive (or compound) and more likely to facilitate the realization of others. The study showed that the resilience indicators ``learning,'' ``belonging,'' and ``social capital'' were more commonly realized, and ``belonging'' and ``learning'' served as foundations for ``social capital'' and ``adaptive capacity'' across the 2-year study period.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study presents a resilience dictionary that improves our understanding of how aspects of resilience are realized in web-based mental health forums. The dictionary provides novel guidance on how to improve training to support and enhance automated systems for moderating mental health forum discussions.},

@article{luo_2022_exploring_energy_saving_refrigerators_through_online_e_commerce_reviews_an_augmented_mining_model_based_on_machine_learning_methods,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Based on climate issues and carbon emissions, this study aims to promote low-carbon consumption and compel consumers to actively shift to energy-saving appliances. In this big data era, online reviews in social and electronic commerce (e-commerce) websites contain valuable product information, which can facilitate firm business strategies and consumer comparison shopping. This study is designed to advance existing research on energy-saving refrigerators by incorporating machine learning models in the analysis of online reviews to provide valuable suggestions to e-commerce platform managers and manufacturers to effectively understand the psychological cognition of consumers.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study proposes an online e-commerce review mining and management strategy model based on ``data acquisition and cleaning, data mining and analysis and strategy formation'' through multiple machine learning methods, namely, Bayes networks, support vector machine (SVM), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and importance--performance analysis (IPA), to help managers.
            
            
              Findings
              Based on a case study of one of the largest e-commerce platforms in China, this study linguistically analyzes 29,216 online reviews of energy-saving refrigerators. Results indicate that the energy-saving refrigerator features that consumers are generally satisfied with are, in sequential order, logistics, function, price, outlook, after-sales service, brand, quality and space. This study also identifies ten topics with 100 keywords by analyzing 18 different refrigerator models. Finally, based on the IPA, this study allocates different priorities to the features and provides suggestions from the perspective of consumers, the government and manufacturers.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              In terms of limitations, future research may focus on the following points. First, the topics identified in this study derive from specific points in time and reviews; thus, the topics may change with the text data. A machine learning-based online review analysis platform could be developed in the future to dynamically improve consumer satisfaction. Moreover, given that consumers' needs may change over time, e-commerce platform types and consumer characteristics, such as user profiles, can be incorporated into the model to effectively analyze trends in consumers' perceived dimensions.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study fills the gap in previous research in this field, which uses small-sample data for qualitative analysis, while integrating management ideas and proposes an online e-commerce review mining and management strategy model based on machine learning methods. Moreover, this study considers how consumers' emotional and thematic preferences for products affect their purchase decision-making from the perspective of their psychological perception and linguistically analyzes online reviews of energy-saving refrigerators using the proposed mining model. Through the improved IPA model, this study provides optimizing strategies to help e-commerce platform managers and manufacturers.},

To achieve this, we used evaluative and relational techniques combining traditional bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and a text mining analysis based on natural processing language (NLP) to search for documents with the term ``social impact'' in the title. The documents were extracted from the database Web of Science (WoS) for the period of 1938--2020. As a result, we mapped the concept of social impact from up to 1677 documents, providing an overview of the topics in which the concept was used (e.g., health, finance, environment and development, etc.) and the trends of research. This work seeks to serve as a roadmap that reflects not only the evolution of social impact but also future lines of research that require attention.},

@article{luo_2021_identification_of_research_priorities_during_the_covid_19_pandemic_implications_for_its_management,
	abstract = {Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a great impact on global production and life in the past period. Countless researchers devoted themselves to rescuing patients and reducing its impact. Analyzing the literature published during the pandemic and identifying the research priorities is of great significance to quickly discover research gaps, rationally allocate scientific research resources, and promote the development of the global research platform. To understand the swing of research priorities during the pandemic, this paper proposed a research priorities identification framework for pandemic based on scientific literature text analysis. Moreover, a research priority metric model was proposed to measure the characteristics of research priorities, and the empirical analysis from COVID-19 scientific literature was conducted to identify the research priorities during the pandemic. As a result, the research priorities identified by the method proposed in this paper discovered the fine-grained dynamic characteristics along with the process in the pandemic outbreak, and based on this, the emergency scientific research response strategies were discussed to give implications for the public health emergency scientific research and management.},

@article{vasquez_henriquez_2020_tweets_on_the_go_gender_differences_in_transport_perception_and_its_discussion_on_social_media,
	abstract = {People often base their mobility decisions on subjective aspects of travel experience, such as time perception, space usage, and safety. It is well recognized that different groups within a population will react differently to the same trip, however, current data collection methods might not consider the multi dimensional aspects of travel perception, which could lead to overlooking the needs of large population groups. In this paper, we propose to measure several aspects of the travel experience from the social media platform Twitter, with a focus on differences with respect to gender. We analyzed more than 400,000 tweets from 100,000 users about transportation from Santiago, Chile. Our main findings show that both genders express themselves differently, as women write about their emotions regarding travel (both, positive and negative feelings), that men express themselves using slang, making it difficult to interpret emotion. The strongest difference is related to harassment, not only on transportation, but also on the public space. Since these aspects are usually omitted from travel surveys, our work provides evidence on how Twitter allows the measurement of aspects of the transportation system in a city that have been studied in qualitative terms, complementing surveys with emotional and safety aspects that are as relevant as those traditionally measured.},

@article{luo_2021_exploring_destination_image_through_online_reviews_an_augmented_mining_model_using_latent_dirichlet_allocation_combined_with_probabilistic_hesitant_fuzzy_algorithm,
	abstract = {Purpose
              In the era of information overload, the density of tourism information and the increasingly sophisticated information needs of consumers have created information confusion for tourists and scenic-area managers. The study aims to help scenic-area managers determine the strengths and weaknesses in the development process of scenic areas and to solve the practical problem of tourists' difficulty in quickly and accurately obtaining the destination image of a scenic area and finding a scenic area that meets their needs.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The study uses a variety of machine learning methods, namely, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) theme extraction model, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting method and sentiment analysis. This work also incorporates probabilistic hesitant fuzzy algorithm (PHFA) in multi-attribute decision-making to form an enhanced tourism destination image mining and analysis model based on visitor expression information. The model is intended to help managers and visitors identify the strengths and weaknesses in the development of scenic areas. Jiuzhaigou is used as an example for empirical analysis.
            
            
              Findings
              In the study, a complete model for the mining analysis of tourism destination image was constructed, and 24,222 online reviews on Jiuzhaigou, China were analyzed in text. The results revealed a total of 10 attributes and 100 attribute elements. From the identified attributes, three negative attributes were identified, namely, crowdedness, tourism cost and accommodation environment. The study provides suggestions for tourists to select attractions and offers recommendations and improvement measures for Jiuzhaigou in terms of crowd control and post-disaster reconstruction.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Previous research in this area has used small sample data for qualitative analysis. Thus, the current study fills this gap in the literature by proposing a machine learning method that incorporates PHFA through the combination of the ideas of management and multi-attribute decision theory. In addition, the study considers visitors' emotions and thematic preferences from the perspective of their expressed information, based on which the tourism destination image is analyzed. Optimization strategies are provided to help managers of scenic spots in their decision-making.},

@article{monselise_2021_topics_and_sentiments_of_public_concerns_regarding_covid_19_vaccines_social_media_trend_analysis,
	abstract = {Background
              As a number of vaccines for COVID-19 are given emergency use authorization by local health agencies and are being administered in multiple countries, it is crucial to gain public trust in these vaccines to ensure herd immunity through vaccination. One way to gauge public sentiment regarding vaccines for the goal of increasing vaccination rates is by analyzing social media such as Twitter.
            
            
              Objective
              The goal of this research was to understand public sentiment toward COVID-19 vaccines by analyzing discussions about the vaccines on social media for a period of 60 days when the vaccines were started in the United States. Using the combination of topic detection and sentiment analysis, we identified different types of concerns regarding vaccines that were expressed by different groups of the public on social media.
            
            
              Methods
              To better understand public sentiment, we collected tweets for exactly 60 days starting from December 16, 2020 that contained hashtags or keywords related to COVID-19 vaccines. We detected and analyzed different topics of discussion of these tweets as well as their emotional content. Vaccine topics were identified by nonnegative matrix factorization, and emotional content was identified using the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner sentiment analysis library as well as by using sentence bidirectional encoder representations from transformer embeddings and comparing the embedding to different emotions using cosine similarity.
            
            
              Results
              After removing all duplicates and retweets, 7,948,886 tweets were collected during the 60-day time period. Topic modeling resulted in 50 topics; of those, we selected 12 topics with the highest volume of tweets for analysis. Administration and access to vaccines were some of the major concerns of the public. Additionally, we classified the tweets in each topic into 1 of the 5 emotions and found fear to be the leading emotion in the tweets, followed by joy.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This research focused not only on negative emotions that may have led to vaccine hesitancy but also on positive emotions toward the vaccine. By identifying both positive and negative emotions, we were able to identify the public's response to the vaccines overall and to news events related to the vaccines. These results are useful for developing plans for disseminating authoritative health information and for better communication to build understanding and trust.},

	abstract = {Construction disputes are one of the main challenges to successful construction projects. Most construction parties experience claims---and even worse, disputes---which are costly and time-consuming to resolve. Lessons learned from past failure cases can help reduce potential future risk factors that likely lead to disputes. In particular, case law, which has been accumulated from the past, is valuable information, providing useful insights to prepare for future disputes. However, few efforts have been made to discover legal knowledge using a large scale of case laws in the construction field. The aim of this paper is to enhance understanding of the multifaceted legal issues surrounding construction adjudication using large amounts of accumulated construction legal cases. This goal is achieved by exploring dispute-related contract terms and conditions that affect judicial decisions based on their verdicts. This study builds on text mining methods to examine what type of contract conditions are frequently referenced in the final decision of each dispute. Various text mining techniques are leveraged for knowledge discovery (i.e., analyzing frequent terms, discovering pairwise correlations, and identifying potential topics) in text-heavy data. The findings show that (1) similar patterns of disputes have occurred repeatedly in construction-related legal cases and (2) the discovered dispute topics indicate that mutually agreed upon contract terms and conditions are import in dispute resolution.},

	abstract = {Community discovery can discover the community structure in a network, and it provides consumers with personalized services and information pushing. It plays an important role in promoting the intelligence of the network society. Most community networks have a community structure whose vertices are gathered into groups which is significant for network data mining and identification. Existing community detection methods explore the original network topology, but they do not make the full use of the inherent semantic information on nodes, e.g., node attributes. To solve the problem, we explore networks by considering both the original network topology and inherent community structures. In this paper, we propose a novel nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model that is divided into two parts, the community structure matrix and the node attribute matrix, and we present a matrix updating method to deal with the nonnegative matrix factorization optimization problem. NMF can achieve large-scale multidimensional data reduction processing to discover the internal relationships between networks and find the degree of network association. The community structure matrix that we proposed provides more information about the network structure by considering the relationships between nodes that connect directly or share similar neighboring nodes. The use of node attributes provides a semantic interpretation for the community structure. We conduct experiments on attributed graph datasets with overlapping and nonoverlapping communities. The results of the experiments show that the performances of the F1-Score and Jaccard-Similarity in the overlapping community and the performances of normalized mutual information (NMI) and accuracy (AC) in the nonoverlapping community are significantly improved. Our proposed model achieves significant improvements in terms of its accuracy and relevance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {In the development background of today's big data era, the research direction of Web hierarchical topic detection and evolution characterized by the semistructured or unstructured data has caught wide attention for academicians. This paper proposes an idea of Web hierarchical topic detection and evolution based on behaviour tracking analysis taking the network big data as the research object, and expounds main implementation methods, which include the instance analysis of the usage mode, the instance analysis of the seed, the set analysis of similar instance supporting the topics, the set analysis of similar instance supporting the events, the evolution analysis of the event, and expounds the algorithm of Web hierarchical topic detection and evolution based on behaviour tracking analysis. The process of experimental analysis is organized as follows, first of all, the experiment analyses the quality of topic detection, the accuracy rate with the number of instance concerned and the seed threshold variation trend, the accuracy rate with the number of instance concerned and the probability threshold variation trend, secondly, the experiment analyses the quality of topic evolution, the accuracy rate with the variation trend of parameter adjustment, the accuracy rate with the number of instance concerned and the similar threshold variation trend, finally, the experiment analyses the time consuming to solve main research problem under different method, the qualitative result of topic detection and evolution under different data set. The results of experimental analysis show the idea is feasible, verifiable and superior, which plays a major role in reconfiguring Web hierarchical topic corpus and providing an intelligent big data warehouse for the network information evolution application.},

@techreport{monselise_2021_topics_and_sentiments_of_public_concerns_regarding_covid_19_vaccines_social_media_trend_analysis_preprint,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND
            As a number of vaccines for COVID-19 are given emergency use authorization by local health agencies and are being administered in multiple countries, it is crucial to gain public trust in these vaccines to ensure herd immunity through vaccination. One way to gauge public sentiment regarding vaccines for the goal of increasing vaccination rates is by analyzing social media such as Twitter.
          
          
            OBJECTIVE
            The goal of this research was to understand public sentiment toward COVID-19 vaccines by analyzing discussions about the vaccines on social media for a period of 60 days when the vaccines were started in the United States. Using the combination of topic detection and sentiment analysis, we identified different types of concerns regarding vaccines that were expressed by different groups of the public on social media.
          
          
            METHODS
            To better understand public sentiment, we collected tweets for exactly 60 days starting from December 16, 2020 that contained hashtags or keywords related to COVID-19 vaccines. We detected and analyzed different topics of discussion of these tweets as well as their emotional content. Vaccine topics were identified by nonnegative matrix factorization, and emotional content was identified using the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner sentiment analysis library as well as by using sentence bidirectional encoder representations from transformer embeddings and comparing the embedding to different emotions using cosine similarity.
          
          
            RESULTS
            After removing all duplicates and retweets, 7,948,886 tweets were collected during the 60-day time period. Topic modeling resulted in 50 topics; of those, we selected 12 topics with the highest volume of tweets for analysis. Administration and access to vaccines were some of the major concerns of the public. Additionally, we classified the tweets in each topic into 1 of the 5 emotions and found fear to be the leading emotion in the tweets, followed by joy.
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS
            This research focused not only on negative emotions that may have led to vaccine hesitancy but also on positive emotions toward the vaccine. By identifying both positive and negative emotions, we were able to identify the public's response to the vaccines overall and to news events related to the vaccines. These results are useful for developing plans for disseminating authoritative health information and for better communication to build understanding and trust.},

@article{petrusevich_2019_analysis_of_students_final_qualification_theses_using_text_loans_detection_systems,
	abstract = {In this paper there are results of the bachelor and master theses citing analysis. These students graduated from the Higher mathematics chair of the Russian Technological University in the summer of 2018. In this comparative analysis the dependencies of thesis loan percent on parameters of students, statistical values of their theses are explored. This research is actual because of the progress and development of new informational technologies used in the educational system. Popularity of the text loan detection systems increases. Automatic plagiarism detection systems are intended to make educational process better, the text drawing search easier, to support the copyright laws and academical honesty. The percentage is given by two main Russian plagiarism detection systems: Antiplagiat and Rucontext. Connections between thesis parameters are explored. Advantages of each text loan detection systems are described. In this research there are the results of the pedagogical experiment aimed to analyze statistically the dependencies of the bachelor's and master's theses loan percentage which have been got from Antiplagiat and Rucontext systems on the author's parameters, statistical values describing thesis text. The comparison between statistical results of these systems have been made. The conclusions about their advantages have been presented in the paper. In order to make the comparison methods of the mathematical statistics have been used. Numerical experiment has been provided by means of the packages of the R statistical language. The difference between text loan percentages in the Antiplagiat and Rucontext systems has been analyzed. It has been shown that it grows when length of the text becomes larger. The dependencies of the text loan percentage on the available parameters of the thesis author and text parameters have been presented. The dependencies types are the same for the both systems. Scale of the coefficients in the statistical dependencies is also the same. The difference is in the very set of the parameters: the Rucontext percentage is better described statistically with the sex of the author, the Antiplagiat percentage is described with the type of the higher education (bachelor's or master's thesis). Also the dependency of the text loan percentage on the length of the thesis text differs: the Antiplagiat percentage is better described statistically with the number of words but the Rucontext percentage is described with the number of characters. It seems that these differences can be explained with different text search and analyze algorithms. The dependencies between the Rucontext percentage and the Antiplagiat text loan percentage is presented.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              With the wealth of information available on the World Wide Web, it is difficult for anyone from a general user to the researcher to easily fulfill their information need. The main challenge is to categorize the documents systematically and also take into account more valuable data such as semantic information. The purpose of this paper is to develop a concept-based search system that leverages the external knowledge resources as the background knowledge for getting the accurate and efficient meaningful search results.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The paper introduces the approach which is based on formal concept analysis (FCA) with the semantic information to support the document management in information retrieval (IR). To describe the semantic information of the documents, the system uses the popular knowledge resources WordNet and Wikipedia. By using FCA, the system creates the concept lattice as the concept hierarchy of the document and proposes the navigation algorithm for retrieving the hierarchy based on the user query.
            
            
              Findings
              The semantic information of the document is based on the two external popular knowledge resources; the authors find that it will be more efficient to deal with the semantic mismatch problems of user need.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The navigation algorithm proposed in this research is applied to the scientific articles of the National Science Foundation (NSF). The proposed system can enhance the integration and exploration of the scientific articles for the advancement of the Scientific and Engineering Research Community.},

	abstract = {Greenhouse farming is an agricultural management system that has demonstrated its efficiency in intensifying food production. These systems constitute a feasible alternative for ensuring food supply, which is one of the greatest challenges faced by humankind in the twenty-first century. Technology has been able to meet the challenges related to greenhouse farming in both contributing to overcoming its limitations, correcting adverse impacts and ensuring system sustainability. The objective of this article is to analyse the global research trends in greenhouse technology over the last two decades, in order to identify the main driving agents, the most outstanding research lines and possible gaps in the literature. Different methodologies have been used for the analysis; both quantitative and qualitative. The principal results show that there are different relevant lines of research related to different aspects of greenhouse farming: the use of water for irrigation, the design of the optimum structure of the greenhouse, conserving the soil in the best growing conditions, energy consumption of the system as a whole, climate control within the facility and pest control. The research is characterized by the being composed largely of ad hoc studies, which hinders the international collaboration between researchers and institutions. The research approach has shifted from being focused on increasing production and cost savings to aspects related to resource conservation and sustainability.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that causes severe respiratory illness in humans, which results in global outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) currently. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving coronaviruses as well as COVID-19 by using topic modeling.
          
          
            Methods
            We extracted all abstracts and retained the most informative words from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, which contains 35,092 pieces of coronavirus related literature published up to March 20, 2020. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling, we trained a topic model from the corpus, analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections.
          
          
            Results
            Eight topics emerged overall: clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. It was observed that current COVID-19 research puts more emphasis on clinical characterization, epidemiological study, and virus transmission. In contrast, topics about diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, genomics and pathogenesis only account for less than 10\% or even 4\% of all the COVID-19 publications, much lower than those of other CoV infections.
          
          
            Conclusions
            These results identified knowledge gaps in the area of COVID-19 and offered directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Many business owners face struggles in determining their prices even with great experience and knowledge in their fields. The present paper addresses one case of this issue: a professional and entrepreneur that offers mechanical and lathe services in his own workshop. The goal of this work was to map the intuitive pricing process of the entrepreneur through a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). Many fuzzy aspects such as the imprecision, uncertainty, and ambiguity of these lathe and maintenance services were related to the potential benefits of FIS, clarifying which methods were used and why. This FIS was constructed to mimic the empirical pricing process of the referred professional and, in this task, this project was successful. Output surfaces showed that complexity and goods value have significant effects just above medium levels and that their impact has a smaller weight than the estimated time. Furthermore, some unexpected outcomes were reached in the system development. Not only was the entrepreneur's reasoning mapped but it also provided more understanding of his own market.},

	abstract = {The relevance of forests to sustain human well-being and the serious threats they face have led to a notable increase of research works on forest ecosystem services during the last few years. This paper analyses the worldwide research dynamics on forest ecosystem services in the period from 1998 to 2017. A bibliometric analysis of 4284 articles was conducted. The results showed that the number of published research articles has especially increased during the last five years. In total, 68.63\% of the articles were published in this period. This research line experiences a growing trend superior to the general publishing trend on forest research. In spite of this increase, its relative significance within the forest research is still limited. The most productive subject areas corresponded to Environmental Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences and Social Sciences Economic topics are understudied. The scientific production is published in a wide range of journals. The three first publishing countries are United States, China and the United Kingdom. The most productive authors are attached to diverse research centres and their contributions are relatively recent. A high level of international cooperation has been observed between countries, institutions and authors. The findings of this study are useful for researchers since they give them an overview of the worldwide research trends on forest ecosystem services.},

@article{feng_2022_the_performance_of_topic_evolution_based_on_a_feature_maximization_measurement_for_the_linguistics_domain,
	abstract = {Understanding the performance of the data mining approach and topic evolution in a certain scientific domain is imperative to capturing key domain developments and facilitating knowledge transfer within and across domains. Our research selects linguistics as an exploratory domain and exploits the feature maximization (FM) measurement for feature selection, combined with the contrast ratio to conduct the diachronic analysis for the linguistics domain's topics. To accurately mine the linguistics domain's topics and obtain the optimal clustering model selection, we exploit an integrated method associated with the deep embedding for clustering (DEC) algorithm based on the keywords-based Text Representation Matrix (KTRM) and Lamirel's EC index and test the performance of this method. The results show that the FM measurement is applicable in the linguistics domain for topic mining, and the combinatory method has the advantage of an unbiased clustering optimization model and applies to the design of non-parameter clustering and algorithms from the low dimension to the high dimension of datasets. The findings suggest that this approach could be suitable for a diachronic analysis of topic evolution and facilitate the performance of topic detection. In addition, these findings of text detection can rise to knowledge fusion cognition with the factor of language as an available research objective in interdisciplinary research.},

	abstract = {Irrigated agriculture plays a fundamental role as a supplier of food and raw materials. However, it is also the world's largest water user. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of studies analyzing agricultural irrigation from the perspective of sustainability with a focus on its environmental, economic, and social impacts. This study seeks to analyze the dynamics of global research in sustainable irrigation in agriculture between 1999 and 2018, including the main agents promoting it and the topics that have received the most attention. To do this, a review and a bibliometric analysis were carried out on a sample of 713 articles. The results show that sustainability is a line of study that is becoming increasingly more prominent within research in irrigation. The study also reveals the existence of substantial differences and preferred topics in the research undertaken by different countries. The priority issues addressed in the research were climatic change, environmental impact, and natural resources conservation; unconventional water resources; irrigation technology and innovation; and water use efficiency. Finally, the findings indicate a series of areas related to sustainable irrigation in agriculture in which research should be promoted.},

@article{liu_2019_predicting_the_evolution_of_physics_research_from_a_complex_network_perspective,
	abstract = {The advancement of science, as outlined by Popper and Kuhn, is largely qualitative, but with bibliometric data, it is possible and desirable to develop a quantitative picture of scientific progress. Furthermore, it is also important to allocate finite resources to research topics that have the growth potential to accelerate the process from scientific breakthroughs to technological innovations. In this paper, we address this problem of quantitative knowledge evolution by analyzing the APS data sets from 1981 to 2010. We build the bibliographic coupling and co-citation networks, use the Louvain method to detect topical clusters (TCs) in each year, measure the similarity of TCs in consecutive years, and visualize the results as alluvial diagrams. Having the predictive features describing a given TC and its known evolution in the next year, we can train a machine learning model to predict future changes of TCs, i.e., their continuing, dissolving, merging, and splitting. We found the number of papers from certain journals, the degree, closeness, and betweenness to be the most predictive features. Additionally, betweenness increased significantly for merging events and decreased significantly for splitting events. Our results represent the first step from a descriptive understanding of the science of science (SciSci), towards one that is ultimately prescriptive.},

@article{rincon_patino_2018_exploring_machine_learning_a_bibliometric_general_approach_using_citespace,
	abstract = {Background:
              Machine learning researches algorithms that allow a machine to learn about resolving problems in different application domains. Due to the wide number of machine learning applications, it is necessary for newcomers to the field to have alternatives to explore this field faster.
            
            
              Methods:
              In this paper, we present a science mapping analysis on the machine learning research in the period 2007-2017. This study was develop using the CiteSpace tool based on results from Clarivate Web of Science. This analysis shows how the field has evolved, by highlighting the most notable authors, institutions, keywords, countries, categories, and journals.
            
            
              Results:
              The results provide information on trends and possibilities in the near future, particularly in areas such as health, biology and banking, where machine learning is a valuable tool to generate solutions.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Machine learning is being widely studied, and several institutions in countries like the USA and China constantly generate machine learning based solutions. Diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer's disease, studies in biology, such as the protein molecule, virtual reality, commerce, smartphones, and ubiquitous computing, are all fields where machine learning contributes to resolving problems.},

@article{zhou_2020_a_discriminative_convolutional_neural_network_with_context_aware_attention,
	abstract = {Feature representation and feature extraction are two crucial procedures in text mining. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown overwhelming success for text-mining tasks, since they are capable of efficiently extracting
              n
              -gram features from source data. However, vanilla CNN has its own weaknesses on feature representation and feature extraction. A certain amount of filters in CNN are inevitably duplicate and thus hinder to discriminatively represent a given text. In addition, most existing CNN models extract features in a fixed way (i.e., max pooling) that either limit the CNN to local optimum nor without considering the relation between all features, thereby unable to learn a contextual
              n
              -gram features adaptively. In this article, we propose a discriminative CNN with context-aware attention to solve the challenges of vanilla CNN. Specifically, our model mainly encourages discrimination across different filters via maximizing their earth mover distances and estimates the salience of feature candidates by considering the relation between context features. We validate carefully our findings against baselines on five benchmark datasets of classification and two datasets of summarization. The results of the experiments verify the competitive performance of our proposed model.},

@article{yan_2019_application_of_a_parallel_particle_swarm_optimization_long_short_term_memory_model_to_improve_water_quality_data,
	abstract = {Water quality data cleaning is important for the management of water environments. A framework for water quality time series cleaning is proposed in this paper. Considering the nonlinear relationships among water quality indicators, support vector regression (SVR) is used to forecast water quality indicators when some indicators are missing or when they show abnormal values at a certain point in time. Considering the time series of water quality information, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are used to forecast water quality indicators when all indicators are missing at a certain point in time. A parallel model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and LSTM is realized based on a microservices architecture to improve the efficiency of model execution and the predictive accuracy of the LSTM networks. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). Inlet water quality data from a wastewater treatment plant in Gaobeidian, Beijing, China is considered as a case study to examine the effectiveness of this approach. The experimental results reveal that this model has better predictive accuracy than other data-driven models because of smaller MAE and RMSE and has an advantage in terms of time consumption compared with standalone serial algorithms.},

	abstract = {Abstract- Determining a policy is often limited in a short time so that decisions are prone to inaccuracies and are ultimately judged to be less targeted. Therefore, there is a necessity to use data mining technology. Currently, especially due to the continuously increasing case of the spread of COVID-19 in Indonesia, in order to reduce the rate of spread of COVID-19, the government has established a COVID-19 vaccination and emergency Community Activity Restriction Implementation (PPKM) policies. For the success of the policies, the government is required to ascertain and understand the attitude of the society. Hence, the policies can be accepted and supported by the society. YouTube is one of the sources to discover people's attitudes because in YouTube, people can express their opinions freely. In this study, a model based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the Deep Learning method was developed to analyze people's attitudes from their writings or posts on social media. As for the algorithm stages, first the model analysis was created using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) algorithms as a comparison. In the COVID-19 vaccination policy, the Bi-LSTM algorithm provided a better evaluation value, i.e., the accuracy value of 87.20\%, recall of 87.14\%, precision of 87.14\%, and F1-score of 87.14\%. In the emergency PPKM policy, the LSTM algorithm provided a better evaluation value of 95.13\%, recall of 93.94\%, precision of 94.08\%, and F1-score of 94.01\%. In addition, using the Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) method to obtain recommendations related to the COVID-19 vaccination policy, the result showed that the government needs to carry out re-socialization regarding vaccination and the impact of the vaccine so that the society can become more cooperative and the emergency PPKM policy needs to be reviewed because it has an impact on the society's economy.},

@article{yu_2021_additive_densenet_dense_connections_based_on_simple_addition_operations,
	abstract = {The Densely Connected Network (DenseNet) has been widely recognized as a highly competitive architecture in Deep Neural Networks. And its most outstanding property is called Dense Connections, which represent each layer's input by concatenating all the preceding layers' outputs and thus improve the performance by encouraging feature reuse to the extreme. However, it is Dense Connections that cause the challenge of dimension-enlarging, making DenseNet very resource-intensive and low efficiency. In the light of this, inspired by the Residual Network (ResNet), we propose an improved DenseNet named Additive DenseNet, which features replacing concatenation operations (used in Dense Connections) with addition operations (used in ResNet), and in terms of feature reuse, it upgrades addition operations to accumulating operations (namely ∑ (·)), thus enables each layer's input to be the summation of all the preceding layers' outputs. Consequently, Additive DenseNet can not only preserve the dimension of input from enlarging, but also retain the effect of Dense Connections. In this paper, Additive DenseNet is applied to text classification task. The experimental results reveal that compared to DenseNet, our Additive DenseNet can reduce the model complexity by a large margin, such as GPU memory usage and quantity of parameters. And despite its high resource economy, Additive DenseNet can still outperform DenseNet on 6 text classification datasets in terms of accuracy and show competitive performance for model training.},

In this regard, as the importance of a web post is evaluated in terms of the number of involved authors, noise distorts the analysis results by adding unnecessary data to the opinion analysis. Here, in this work, an automatic detection model for spam posts in web forums using both conventional machine learning and deep learning is proposed. To automatically differentiate between normal posts and spam, evaluators were asked to recognize spam posts in advance. To construct the machine learning-based model, text features from posted content using text mining techniques from the perspective of linguistics were extracted, and supervised learning was performed to distinguish content noise from normal posts. For the deep learning model, raw text including and excluding special characters was utilized. A comparison analysis on deep neural networks using the two different recurrent neural network (RNN) models of the simple RNN and long short-term memory (LSTM) network was also performed. Furthermore, the proposed model was applied to two web forums. The experimental results indicate that the deep learning model affords significant improvements over the accuracy of conventional machine learning associated with text features. The accuracy of the proposed model using LSTM reaches 98.56\%, and the precision and recall of the noise class reach 99\% and 99.53\%, respectively.},

@techreport{li_2021_an_improved_term_weighting_method_based_on_relevance_frequency_for_text_classification,
	abstract = {Abstract
          As a vital step of text classification (TC) task, the assignment of term weight has a great influence on the performance of TC. Currently, masses of term weighting schemes can be utilized, such as term frequency-inverse documents frequency (TF-IDF) and term frequency-relevance frequency (TF-RF), and they are all consisted of local part (TF) and global part (e.g., IDF, RF). However, most of these schemes adopt the logarithmic processing on their respective global parts, and it is natural to consider whether the logarithmic processing apply to all these schemes or not. Actually, for a specific term weighting scheme, due to its different ratio of local weight and global weight resulting from logarithmic processing, it usually shows diverse text clasification results on different text sets, which presents poor robustness. To explore the influence of logarithmic processing imposed on the global weight on the classification result of term weighting schemes, TF-RF is selected as the representative because it can achieve a better performance among these schemes adopting logarithmic processing. Then, two propositions along with corresponding methods about the relation between TF part and RF part are proposed based on TF-RF. In addition, two groups of experiments are conducted on the two methods. The first group of experiments proves that one method (denoted as TF-ERF) is more helpful to the improvement than the other one (denoted as ETF-RF). The second group of experiments shows that TF-ERF not only ourperforms TF-RF but also obtains better performance than other existing term weighting schemes.},

@article{kim_2020_transparency_and_accountability_in_ai_decision_support_explaining_and_visualizing_convolutional_neural_networks_for_text_information,
	abstract = {Proliferating applications of deep learning, along with the prevalence of large-scale text datasets, have revolutionized the natural language processing (NLP) field, thereby driving the recent explosive growth. Nevertheless, it is argued that state-of-the-art studies focus excessively on producing quantitative performances superior to existing models, by playing ``the Kaggle game.'' Hence, the field requires more effort in solving new problems and proposing novel approaches and architectures. We claim that one of the promising and constructive efforts would be to design transparent and accountable artificial intelligence (AI) systems for text analytics. By doing so, we can enhance the applicability and problem-solving capacity of the system for real-world decision support. It is widely accepted that deep learning models demonstrate remarkable performances compared to existing algorithms. However, they are often criticized for being less interpretable, i.e., the ``black box.'' In such cases, users tend to hesitate to utilize them for decision-making, especially in crucial tasks. Such complexity obstructs transparency and accountability of the overall system, potentially debilitating the deployment of decision support systems powered by AI. Furthermore, recent regulations are emphasizing fairness and transparency in algorithms to a greater extent, turning explanations more compulsory than voluntary. Thus, to enhance the transparency and accountability of the decision support system and preserve the capacity to model complex text data at the same time, we propose the Explaining and Visualizing Convolutional neural networks for Text information (EVCT) framework. By adopting and ameliorating cutting-edge methods in NLP and image processing, the EVCT framework provides a human-interpretable solution to the problem of text classification while minimizing information loss. Experimental results with large-scale, real-world datasets show that EVCT performs comparably to benchmark models, including widely used deep learning models. In addition, we provide instances of human-interpretable and relevant visualized explanations obtained from applying EVCT to the dataset and possible applications for real-world decision support.},

In this paper, we employ a text mining methodology to generate industry-specific ``smoke terms'' for identifying these defects in the countertop appliances and over-the-counter medicine industries. Building upon prior work, we propose several methodological improvements to enhance the precision of our industry-specific terms. First, we replace the subjective manual curation of these terms with an automated Tabu search algorithm, which provides a statistically significant improvement over a sample of human-curated lists. Contrary to the assumptions of prior work, we find that shorter, targeted smoke term lists produce superior precision. Second, we incorporate non-textual review features to enhance the performance of these smoke term lists. In total, we find greater than a twofold improvement over typical human-curated lists. As safety surveillance is vital across industries, our method has great potential to assist firms and regulatory agencies in identifying and responding quickly to safety defects.},

We aim to determine which words and phrases are indicators of defects in online reviews and whether sentiment analysis is sufficient for automated defect discovery in the baby crib industry. We find that sentiment analysis serves as a useful tool for automated defect discovery in the baby crib industry and create a supplementary set of ``smoke terms'' that are strong indicators of safety defects in online reviews of baby cribs. Using our term-based scoring method, we observe a 59% improvement in precision and a 60% improvement in recall when compared to the top-performing prior sentiment method. Our findings provide actionable insights into how analysis of online reviews and other social media can improve baby crib quality management techniques.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a comprehensive analytics framework that can serve as a decision support tool for HR recruiters in real-world settings in order to improve hiring and placement decisions. The proposed framework follows two main phases: a local prediction scheme for recruitments' success at the level of a single job placement, and a mathematical model that provides a global recruitment optimization scheme for the organization, taking into account multilevel considerations. In the first phase, a key property of the proposed prediction approach is the interpretability of the machine learning (ML) model, which in this case is obtained by applying the Variable-Order Bayesian Network (VOBN) model to the recruitment data. Specifically, we used a uniquely large dataset that contains recruitment records of hundreds of thousands of employees over a decade and represents a wide range of heterogeneous populations. Our analysis shows that the VOBN model can provide both high accuracy and interpretability insights to HR professionals. Moreover, we show that using the interpretable VOBN can lead to unexpected and sometimes counter-intuitive insights that might otherwise be overlooked by recruiters who rely on conventional methods. We demonstrate that it is feasible to predict the successful placement of a candidate in a specific position at a pre-hire stage and utilize predictions to devise a global optimization model. Our results show that in comparison to actual recruitment decisions, the devised framework is capable of providing a balanced recruitment plan while improving both diversity and recruitment success rates, despite the inherent trade-off between the two.},

	abstract = {Product innovation is important for firms to gain competitive advantages in a dynamic business environment. Traditionally, customers are not very much involved in product innovation processes. With the technology of Web 2.0, online users are enabled and motivated to provide reviews and discussions about product features and use experiences. User generated product reviews have been found to have a word-of-mouth effect as a new element of marketing communication. However, their implication on improving product innovation cycles have not been studied before. Guided by a persuasion theory, we extracted the central and peripheral persuasion cues from user generated reviews and examined their impact on mobile app developers' product innovation decisions. Using data collected from the Google App store, our empirical study shows that long and easy-to-read user reviews with mildly negative reviews can increase the likelihood of a future mobile app update. Our findings highlight the need for researchers to explore user generated reviews in the context of customer-centered product innovation.},

	abstract = {Widespread adoption of automated decision making by artificial intelligence (AI) is witnessed due to specular advances in computation power and improvements in optimization algorithms especially in machine learning (ML). Complex ML models provide good prediction accuracy; however, the opacity of ML models does not provide sufficient assurance for their adoption in the automation of lending decisions. This paper presents an explainable AI decision-support-system to automate the loan underwriting process by belief-rule-base (BRB). This system can accommodate human knowledge and can also learn from historical data by supervised learning. The hierarchical structure of BRB can accommodates factual and heuristic rules. The system can explain the chain of events leading to a decision for a loan application by the importance of an activated rule and the contribution of antecedent attributes in the rule. A business case study on automation of mortgage underwriting is demonstrated to show that the BRB system can provide a good trade-off between accuracy and explainability. The textual explanation produced by the activation of rules could be used as a reason for denial of a loan. The decision-making process for an application can be comprehended by the significance of rules in providing the decision and contribution of its antecedent attributes.},

	abstract = {Consumer recommendations of products and services are important performance indicators for organizations to gain feedback on their offerings. Furthermore, they are important for prospective customers to learn from prior consumer experiences. In this study, we focus on user-generated content, in particular online reviews, to investigate which service aspects are evaluated by consumers and how these factors explain a consumer's recommendation. Further, we investigate how recommendations can be predicted automatically based on such user-driven responses. We disentangle the recommendation decision by performing explanatory and predictive analyses focusing on a sample of airline reviews. We identify core and augmented service aspects expressed in the online review. We then show that service aspect-specific sentiment indicators drive the decision to recommend an airline and that these factors can be incorporated in a predictive model using data mining techniques. We also find that the business model of an airline being reviewed, whether low cost or full service, is also an applicable consideration. Our results are highly relevant for practitioners to analyze and act on consumer feedback in a prompt manner, along with the ability of gaining a deeper understanding of the service from multiple aspects. Also, potential travelers can benefit from this approach by getting an aggregated view on service quality.},

@article{srinivas_2019_topic_based_knowledge_mining_of_online_student_reviews_for_strategic_planning_in_universities,
	abstract = {Over the past few years, studies observe a continuous decline in university enrollment and retention rates resulting in millions of dollars in lost revenue. Past research shows that 95% of the students rely heavily on the positive word-of-mouth to select a college. Especially, with the advent of Web 2.0 tools, students are able to make informed decisions due to increased awareness through online reviews. Academic institutions can also leverage this information to understand and improve their students' perception. The objective of this paper is to identify the current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of a university by analyzing online student reviews using text analytics. Our proposed approach integrates four different techniques: topic modeling, sentiment analysis, root cause and SWOT analyses. First, we introduce an ensemble of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (E-LDA) topic models to automatically identify the key features (topics) that are predominantly discussed by students and categorize each review sentence into the most related topic. We then detect the opinion associated with each sentence (positive, negative and neutral) using sentiment analysis. Finally, a topic-based opinion summary (TOS) for a university is established to identify its strengths and weaknesses from the students' perspective, and the opportunities and threats are determined by analyzing the TOS of the competitors (or other similar institutions). A case study is used to illustrate the feasibility and application of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed method provides an efficient and economic performance summary of a university and its competitors, and could help its leaders in recruitment and retention efforts.},

This paper critically assesses multiple approaches for detecting defect-related discussion, ranging from out-of-the-box sentiment analyses to supervised and unsupervised machine-learned defect terms. We examine reviews from 25 product and service categories to assess each method's performance. We examine each approach across the broad cross-section of categories as well as when tailored to a singular category of study. Surprisingly, we found that negative sentiment was often a poor predictor of defect-related discussion. Terms generated with unsupervised topic modeling tended to correspond to generic product discussions rather than defect-related discussion. Supervised learning techniques outperformed the other text analytic techniques in our cross-category analysis, and they were especially effective when confined to a single category of study. Our work suggests a need for category-specific text analyses to take full advantage of consumer-driven quality intelligence.},

@article{zhang_2021_mining_product_innovation_ideas_from_online_reviews,
	abstract = {The importance of online customer reviews to product innovation has been well-recognized in prior literature. Mining online reviews has received extensive attention and efforts. Most existing research on mining online reviews focus on issues such as the impact of reviews on sales, helpfulness of reviews, and customers' participation in reviews. Few research studies, however, seek to identify and extract innovation ideas for products from online reviews. This type of information is particularly important for product functionality improvement and new feature development from a manufacturer's perspective. Mining product innovation ideas allows a manufacturer to proactively review customer opinion and unlock insights about new functionality and features that the market expects, in order to gain a competitive advantage. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach to identify sentences that contain innovation ideas from online reviews. Specifically, we develop a novel ensemble embedding method to generate semantic and contextual representations of the words in review sentences. The resultant representations in each sentence are then used in a long short-term memory (LSTM) model for innovation-sentence identification. Moreover, we adopt a focal loss function in our model to address the class imbalance problem. We validate our approach with a dataset of 10,000 customer reviews from Amazon. Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.91 and an F1 score of 0.89, outperforming a set of state-of-the-art baseline models in the comparison. Our approach can be extended and applied to many other information extraction tasks.},

@article{ramanathan_2017_role_of_social_media_in_retail_network_operations_and_marketing_to_enhance_customer_satisfaction,
	abstract = {Purpose The technology evolution compels retail networks to introduce unique business models to retain customers and to gain a competitive advantage. Customer reviews available through social media need to be taken into account by retail networks to design a model with unique service operations and marketing approaches that will improve loyalty by adding value to customers. Furthermore, the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer spending behaviour is very weak and needs further investigation. Hence the purpose of this paper is to understand how retail network leverage the potential of social media reviews along with unique service operations to satisfy customers. The study analyses the nexus of: a brand, promotional offers, service operations; and their interaction through social media reviews on customer satisfaction levels. Design/methodology/approach The authors develop a conceptual model for the social media era. The authors combine the idea of loyalty- and value-based models of Chatterjee (2013). The authors employed a survey questionnaire method to elicit opinions of retail customer satisfaction based on social media reviews, service operations and marketing efforts. The authors derive measures of the model from existing literature and expert opinion. Findings Social media reviews dramatically impact upon customer satisfaction. Similarly the empirical analysis identifies the significant and positive role played by service operations in customer satisfaction levels. Interestingly the authors did not find unequivocal support for brand satisfaction impacting on customer satisfaction. However, when promotions interact well with service operations, the level of customer satisfaction is significantly affected. Similarly the authors did not observe a positive outcome when there is an interaction between promotion and social media reviews. After reading the reviews, some potential buyers make a visit to store before making final decisions and surprisingly, promotional effects do not change their mind set. Practical implications Research findings confirm the importance of social media reviews, marketing and interaction between promotion and service operations enabling retail networks to build loyalty and value-based models. Based on customer behaviour, the study suggests a need to consider operational efficiencies when promoting sales; through careful planning, customer satisfaction and profitability levels can be increased. This sends a strong message to the retail network to defend their position within a very competitive business market. Originality/value The empirical evidence based on customer experience would be helpful for companies in integrating their operations and marketing efforts enabling them to convert different segment of customers such as ``free riders (higher satisfaction and low profitability)''and ``vulnerable customers (low satisfaction and higher profitability)''into ``star customers (higher satisfaction and high profitability)''. Through a considered approach: combining social media reviews, marketing and operations, businesses will be better-placed to survive in the ultra-competitive social media-influenced era.},

This user-generated content (UGC) can be useful to understand customers' shopping experiences and influence future customers' purchase intentions. Therefore, business intelligence and analytics are increasingly being advocated as a way to analyze customers' UGC in social media and support firms' marketing activities. However, because of its open structure, UGC such as customer reviews can be difficult to analyze, and firms find it challenging to harness UGC. To fill this gap, this study aims to examine customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction toward attributes of hotel products and services based on online customer textual reviews. Using a text mining approach, latent semantic analysis (LSA), we identify the key attributes driving customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction toward hotel products and service attributes. Additionally, using a regression approach, we examine the effects of travel purposes, hotel types, star level, and editor recommendations on customers' perceptions of attributes of hotel products and services. This study bridges customer online textual reviews with customers' perceptions to help business managers better understand customers' needs through UGC.},

@article{wiener_2018_omnichannel_businesses_in_the_publishing_and_retailing_industries_synergies_and_tensions_between_coexisting_online_and_offline_business_models,
	abstract = {Since the emergence of the Internet, many brick-and-mortar companies from various industries have established an online business model (BM) alongside their traditional offline BM. Despite the increasing coexistence of online and offline BMs within a single company, however, most prior research has focused on studying online and offline BMs in isolation. Consequently, still little is known about the interplay of dual BMs in omnichannel businesses. We address this research gap through an empirical investigation of the synergies and tensions that arise from coexisting online and offline BMs as well as the factors that influence the emergence of such synergies and tensions. Drawing on a series of six case studies with three publishers and three retailers, we identify an extended set of BM synergies and tensions, which concern all major BM dimensions. In addition, our case analysis reveals that companies are able to exploit different synergies, but also face different tensions between their online and offline BMs. The observed differences can be traced back to the level of online-offline BM integration, online-offline product distinctions (e.g., in terms of product content and publication cycles), and general organization context factors (e.g., offline brand strength, organization structure). By uncovering both the benefits and the complexity of running online and offline BMs in parallel, our study contributes to the theoretical understanding of omnichannel businesses, and provides managers with practical guidance on how to design, integrate, and manage their dual BMs successfully.},

Mobile devices are becoming first screen for the customers and are being used by marketers to have interactive communication making it more suitable for building customer engagement. The research in this space however is in a very nascent stage. Current study is one of the first few empirical studies exploring the role of customer engagement in writing online reviews. The study explores mediating role of customer engagement in satisfaction - online review intention and trust - online review intention relationships. Further moderating role of trust and satisfaction levels in customer engagement - online review intention is explored. This study contributes to marketing literature in the space of customer engagement, online reviews and mobile shopping behaviour. Further, this study provides a framework to managers for motivating the customers in writing online reviews. Also recommendations for retailers in exploiting customer engagement on mobile platforms are provided to address merchants and advertisers for better management of a new technology.},

@article{sheng_2017_a_multidisciplinary_perspective_of_big_data_in_management_research,
	abstract = {In recent years, big data has emerged as one of the prominent buzzwords in business and management. In spite of the mounting body of research on big data across the social science disciplines, scholars have offered little synthesis on the current state of knowledge. To take stock of academic research that contributes to the big data revolution, this paper tracks scholarly work's perspectives on big data in the management domain over the past decade. We identify key themes emerging in management studies and develop an integrated framework to link the multiple streams of research in fields of organisation, operations, marketing, information management and other relevant areas. Our analysis uncovers a growing awareness of big data's business values and managerial changes led by data-driven approach. Stemming from the review is the suggestion for research that both structured and unstructured big data should be harnessed to advance understanding of big data value in informing organisational decisions and enhancing firm competitiveness. To discover the full value, firms need to formulate and implement a data-driven strategy. In light of these, the study identifies and outlines the implications and directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Social media such as forums, blogs and microblogs has been increasingly used for public information sharing and opinions exchange nowadays. It has changed the way how online community interacts and somehow has led to a new trend of engagement for online retailers especially on microblogging websites such as Twitter. In this study, we investigated the impact of online retailers' engagement with the online brand communities on users' perception of brand image and service. Firstly, we analysed the overall sentiment trends of different brands and the patterns of engagement between companies and customers using the collected tweets posted on a popular social media platform, Twitter. Then, we studied how different types of engagements affect customer sentiments. Our analysis shows that engagement has an effect on sentiments that associate with brand image, perception and customer service of the online retailers. Our findings indicate that the level, length, type and attitude of retailers' engagement with social media users have a significant impact on their sentiments. Based on our results, we derived several important managerial and practical implications.},

Here we are only interested in following the financial community. This paper focuses on detecting events popularity through sentiment analysis of tweets published by the financial community on the Twitter universe. The detection of events popularity on Twitter makes this a non-trivial task due to noisy content that often are the tweets. This work aims to filter out all the noisy tweets in order to analyze only the tweets that influence the financial market, more specifically the thirty companies that compose the Dow Jones Average. To perform these tasks, in this paper it is proposed a methodology that starts from the financial community of Twitter and then filters the collected tweets, makes the sentiment analysis of the tweets and finally detects the important events in the life of companies.},

Much of the increase in data quality and application possibilities comes from a mix of new data sources, a smart application of statistical tools and domain knowledge combined with theoretical insights. The importance of theory in guiding any systematic search for answers to retailing questions, as well as for streamlining analysis remains undiminished, even as the role of big data and predictive analytics in retailing is set to rise in importance, aided by newer sources of data and large-scale correlational techniques. The Statistical issues discussed include a particular focus on the relevance and uses of Bayesian analysis techniques (data borrowing, updating, augmentation and hierarchical modeling), predictive analytics using big data and a field experiment, all in a retailing context. Finally, the ethical and privacy issues that may arise from the use of big data in retailing are also highlighted.},

This new CRS is the first one that is completely independent of the rating agency. The estimated ratings are compared with ratings provided by Fitch Ratings for 310 European and US non-financial corporates. Findings The empirical analysis shows that logarithmized CDS spreads and issuer credit ratings by agencies have a linear relationship. The new CRS provides market participants with an alternative risk assessment, which is solely based on market factors, and does not rely on credit rating analysts. The results indicate that our CRS is able to anticipate agency ratings in advance. Moreover, the analysis shows that the trading volume has only a limited influence in the anticipation of rating changes. Originality/value This study shows a new approach to measure the creditworthiness of firms by analyzing CDS spreads. This is highly relevant for regulation, firm monitoring and investors.},

	abstract = {We use machine learning methods to create a comprehensive measure of credit risk based on qualitative information disclosed in conference calls and in management's discussion and analysis section of the 10-K. In out-of-sample tests, we find that our measure improves the ability to predict credit events (bankruptcies, interest spreads, and credit rating downgrades), relative to credit risk measures developed by prior research (e.g., z-score). We also find our measure based on conference calls explains within-firm variation in future credit events; however, we find little evidence that the measures of credit risk developed by prior research explain within-firm variation in credit risk. Our measure has utility for both academics and practitioners, as the majority of firms do not have readily available measures of credit risk, such as actively-traded CDS or credit ratings. Our study also adds to the growing body of research using machine-learning methods to gather information from conference calls and MD\&A to explain key outcomes.},

Airbnb requires remarkable trust that goes beyond the level where both user and host take risks from a sharing transaction. This paper suggests an empirical research model developed based on the trust building model and attachment theory explaining how users develop their trust and further attachment through two major routes. The results indicate that the cognitive trust-identity attachment building mechanism is more effective than affective trust-bond attachment depending on the emotional distance between the users and hosts. Finally, this paper provides scholars with theoretical enhancement on the trust and attachment literature and recommends managers of the sharing businesses to enrich users' trust-attachment toward the firm and the service provider that has a strong influence on users' behavioral intention to use.},

	abstract = {Remarketing and reselling remanufactured electronic products is one of the effective and sustainable approaches to deal with the rapidly increasing e-waste. Studying customer purchasing intention and behavior toward remanufactured products can help businesses better understand customers' needs and improve closed-loop supply chain performance. Via an empirical study based on new, manufacturer remanufactured, seller remanufactured, and used products transaction data from eBay, one of the most popular online markets, this paper investigates the impact of e-service offerings in four online transaction phases (i.e., information, agreement, fulfillment, and after-sales phase) on customer purchasing intention toward remanufactured products in both auctions and fixed price transactions. The results indicate that e-service offerings in the information phase are most influential on customers' willingness to pay (WTP) in both types of transactions. In addition, we find e-services in auctions has higher positive influence on customers' WTP compared to fixed price transactions, as demonstrated by the results that e-services in all four online transaction phases significantly influence customers' WTP in auctions, but not in fixed price transactions. The results also show that in both types of transactions, customers are willing to pay a premium for seller remanufactured products, and even more for manufacturer remanufactured products and new products, compared with used products. Furthermore, we discuss the managerial implications on customer online purchasing intention toward remanufactured products and online sellers' sales strategies.},

Drawing on a collection of 435 publications on the sharing economy and related terms, we identify some trends in the literature and underlying research interests. Specifically, we organize the literature around the concept of platform mediation, and draw a set of essential affordances of sharing economy technologies from the reviewed literature. We present the notion of platform centralization/decentralization as an effective organizing principle for the variety of perspectives on the sharing economy, and also evaluate scholars' treatment of technology itself. Finally, we identify important gaps in the existing literature on the relationship between digital platforms and sharing economy, and provide directions for future investigations.},

The results suggest that, for motivations, price value, enjoyment, and home benefits significantly explain overall attitude toward Airbnb. As for constraints, distrust is the only factor that significantly predicts overall attitude, while insecurity is directly related to behavioral intentions. Overall attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms, such as social influence and trend affinity, predict behavioral intentions. This study contributes to the literature by simultaneously examining the predictive power of both motivations and constraints of Airbnb consumers in explaining overall attitude and purchase behavior.},

@article{roma_2019_sharing_economy_and_incumbents_pricing_strategy_the_impact_of_airbnb_on_the_hospitality_industry,
	abstract = {In this paper, we examine how the emergence of sharing economy platforms influences incumbents' price responses. Grounding on the literature on price reactions to new entrants and on the unique characteristics of the sharing economy, we argue that the effect of the penetration of the sharing economy on incumbents' prices is not straightforward, and actually depends on the type of incumbents as well as certain product/service offer characteristics. Indeed, relying on a large sample of hotel price offerings from the Italian market, we find that the effect of the growing relevance of the sharing economy (exemplified by Airbnb) on incumbents' prices depends on the type of incumbents (low/medium-end versus high-end hotels) as well as on the accommodation period (weekend versus weekdays), and thus on the type of consumers looking for accommodation. Specifically, low/medium-end incumbents set lower prices in geographical areas where sharing economy has a higher penetration, but this occurs only for weekend accommodation search. In contrast, high-end incumbents tend to set higher prices in geographical areas where sharing economy has a higher penetration, irrespective of the accommodation period. We discuss the important implications of our findings for incumbents, sharing economy platforms, consumers, and policy makers.},

	abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to investigate customers'perceptions of the service quality facets of Airbnb accommodation using social exchange theory as a suitable conceptual framework to explain aspects of interactivity between guests and hosts. Design/methodology/approach A self-administered questionnaire consisting of 25 accommodation-specific service quality attributes, structured according to Akbaba's (2006) measurement scale and based on the service quality hierarchical conceptualization described by Brady and Cronin (2001) and Cronin and Taylor (1992), was distributed to Airbnb international guests visiting Phuket, Thailand. The sample was chosen through a two-stage sampling process and the PLS-SEM technique was used for data analysis. Findings The results showed that convenience and assurance are critical contributors to the measurement of service quality in remote Airbnb lodgings. The findings further revealed that Airbnb guests are mainly interested in lodgings which have access to certain tourist sights, and in easily accessible information and efficient resolution of problems during their stay. The authors also found that guests greatly value the convenience and flexibility offered by Airbnb, and that they particularly appreciate the warm hospitality provided by the hosts. Finally, Airbnb guests have very low expectations of the amenities and services available at the lodgings. Research limitations/implications Airbnb is one of the most well-known examples of hospitality in the sharing economy, and results cannot be generalized to similar accommodation providers in sharing economies. Despite the appropriateness of using the measurement tool provided by Akbaba (2006), it is only one option among others for measuring service quality. Practical implications The current study can assist hosts in gaining better knowledge of guests'decision-making processes and in designing effective marketing strategies by focusing on guests'requirements in terms of service quality. The effective use of competitive strengths and the prioritization of business resources would potentially enhance guests'positive experiences at the accommodation and at the destination. Originality/value Limited numbers of studies have focused on the sharing economy and hospitality and in particular on Airbnb, and this is the first study with a focus on service quality issues in terms of Airbnb accommodation.},

Given the divide that exists, this paper proposes a phenomenographic approach to the study of destination competitiveness. Specifically, the paper argues that efforts to advance destination competitiveness should be preceded by a better understanding of how destination stakeholders is conceptualize the term. This paper explores how destination stakeholders understand destination competitiveness. The findings reveal three distinct conceptions of destination competitiveness which are hierarchically related: destination competitiveness as perception of a destination, destination competitiveness as performance, and destination competitiveness as a long-term process.

@article{netter_2019_sharing_economy_revisited_towards_a_new_framework_for_understanding_sharing_models,
	abstract = {In recent years, several scholarly attempts have been made to conceptually outline the contours of the sharing economy. However, there is still limited consensus on fundamental characteristics of sharing models, the markets they create, and the controversies surrounding them. Based on an assessment of existing typologies of the sharing economy, this paper outlines a new theory-driven framework for describing and analyzing business-to-consumer and peer-to-peer sharing models that draws on the nascent literature of partial organization. Emphasizing the core organizational characteristics of sharing models (membership, rules, monitoring, sanctioning, and hierarchy), this new framework moves beyond existing definitions and scales used to map and analyze the fast-growing sharing economy field.},

This study focuses on a reciprocal aspect of social interactions in P2P accommodations and aims to: 1) explore how guests and hosts perceive online and face-to-face interactions between them and 2) investigate the association between P2P interactions and some outcome variables (encounter satisfaction, word-of-mouth intention, and continuous intention to use) based on the roles of guest and host. A total of 503 responses from an online research panel were analyzed. The results show that guests perceive overall interaction experiences more positively than do hosts. Moreover, guests and hosts place weight on different interaction factors that contribute to their satisfaction and behavioral intentions. This study sheds light on the reciprocal interactions between guests and hosts, providing important theoretical and practical implications for the P2P lodging experience.},

Design/methodology/approach This study proposes and tests an integrative model that synthesizes the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Prospect Theory (PT) and other Airbnb-relevant constructs (unique experience expectation, familiarity and electronic word of mouth) as the primary determinants of the Airbnb repurchase intention using an structural equation model (SEM) approach. Findings Both attitude and subject norms are significant determinants of repurchase intention, whereas perceived behavioral control is not. In addition, perceived value and risk have only direct significant impacts on attitude and, in turn, indirectly affect repurchase intention. Unique experience expectation, familiarity and electronic word of mouth exert direct and indirect influences on repurchase intention. Research limitations/implications This study extends the body of knowledge by integrating TPB and PT to investigate consumer repurchase intention in Airbnb, which provides a theoretical baseline and serves as a starting point for exploring the structural relationships of Airbnb and the sharing economy. Practical implications Airbnb should place more emphasis on value packages and authentic/unique travel experience to retain and attract more travelers. More safety/security programs should be put in place and clearly communicated to reduce the perceived risks. In addition, Airbnb may publicize positive word of mouth and introduce and expand familiarity programs to incentivize Airbnb travelers. Originality/value This study explores the psychological reasons why travelers will re-patronize Airbnb, providing insights into the motives of Airbnb travelers. A clear understanding of Airbnb travelers'repurchase intention will facilitate to develop effective strategies for Airbnb to induce positive repurchase behaviors.},

While research has begun to explore segmentation between users and non-users, only limited research has looked at consumer segmentation within sharing economy services. In this paper, we build on this research gap by investigating consumer segmentation within a single sharing economy platform: Airbnb. Utilizing a mixed methods approach, with both a quantitative survey and a qualitative content analysis of Airbnb listings, we compare two different types of accommodation offered on Airbnb: shared room and entire home. Our findings indicate that within a single platform, the variety between offerings can create distinct consumer segments based on both demographics and behavioral criteria. We also find that Airbnb hosts use marketing logic to target their listings towards specific consumer segments. However, there is not, in all cases, strong alignment between consumer segmentation and host targeting, leading to potentially reduced matching efficiency.},

To that end, marketers need to develop personalized messages to enhance click-through rates and online purchases. This study explores online advertising strategies for an emerging lodging concept---Airbnb. Airbnb distinguishes itself from traditional hotels by offering guests a ``feeling at home'' (e.g., belongingness) and an ``atypical place to stay'' (e.g., uniqueness). In this research, we examine the interaction effect of advertising appeal (belongingness vs. uniqueness) and an individual's sense of power (low vs. high) on click-through intention and purchase intention. The findings suggest that powerless individuals respond more favorably to the belongingness appeal, whereas powerful individuals react more positively to the uniqueness appeal. Furthermore, results from a mediation analysis reveal that self-brand connection is the underlying mechanism that explains these effects. Managerial implications for hospitality marketers are discussed.},

However, few studies targeting the vacation-rental industry have investigated online reviews. To narrow this gap, this study focuses mainly on the gamification design developed by Airbnb that awards a ``Superhost'' badge to hosts who receive good reviews and observes how this can impact an accommodation's review volume and ratings. All available information regarding Airbnb accommodation offered in Hong Kong was retrieved from Airbnb's website. We then constructed a negative binomial model and a Tobit model with different independent variables and controlled a set of variables relating to accommodation characteristics. The results show that an accommodation with the ``Superhost'' badge is more likely to receive reviews and higher ratings. In addition, guests are willing to spend more on ``Superhost'' accommodations. Based on our findings, we present implications for research and host practice.},

Specifically, this study examined whether individual-level anthropomorphic tendency and text-personification of destination marketing communications interact to influence destination attitude and travel intentions. Results from a study involving 210 Australian participants revealed that destination attitude and travel intentions were most favorable for people with high levels of anthropomorphic tendency and who were exposed to personified tourism messages. These findings indicate that text-personification represents a new communication tactic for tourism -- particularly for target consumers who are high in anthropomorphic tendency -- and one that can humanize the destination leading to more favorable attitudes and higher intentions to travel. This effect is mediated by positive emotions. People with high anthropomorphic tendency who are exposed to a personified advertisement feel more positive emotions, which lead to positive tourism outcomes.},

Our results show that the effect of perceived review quality on information overload is enhanced when the consumer chooses to read more reviews. Individual characteristics are also relevant; consumers' product knowledge moderates the mediating effect of decision difficulty on satisfaction.

We collected survey data from participants in eleven countries - China, India, Jamaica, Namibia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Our findings provide evidence that, while both collectivism and masculinism positively affect individuals' intention to rent out and rent products, uncertainty avoidance significantly discourages individuals from renting out their products to others. We also find that the product category significantly affects renting out and renting intentions of individuals using peer-to-peer exchanges.},

	abstract = {This study aims to examine how performance of hotel services symmetrically and asymmetrically affects overall customer satisfaction. For this purpose, data were collected from Turkish, German and Russian hotel customers staying at a five-star golf hotel in the Belek area in Antalya-Turkey. Data were first analyzed by multi-variable regression analysis for clarifying the symmetric impacts of eight service dimensions on overall customer satisfaction. Results showed that Entertainment Services, Restaurant Services, Cleaning of General Areas and Foreign Language Knowledge of Staff had the highest influences on customer satisfaction. Penalty-reward-contrast analysis was performed for the same service dimensions to understand their asymmetric influences on customer satisfaction. Significantly different categorizations (i.e. satisfiers; dissatisfiers if absent; hybrids) were obtained for three major market segments. Entertainment Services had been the only dimension which was categorized as a `dissatisfier if absent' for all markets. Additional comparisons were made among the first-time and repeat customers, whereas Housekeeping Services were identified as the `dissatisfiers if absent' for both groups.},

	abstract = {The global rise of the sharing economy has attracted widespread attention among managers, marketers and researchers as non-ownership modes of consumption are increasingly being adopted by consumers. Building on previous research that distinguishes non-ownership consumption programs, this article investigates the role of materialism in participation in sharing-based programs of the sharing economy cross culturally. Unlike previous research that stated that materialism is in contrast with sharing, this research shows that under certain circumstances, both in America and India, materialism will lead to greater participation in the sharing economy. However, the reason why is different for each culture. For Americans, this effect is expected to surface for programs that resemble sharing as they don't compete with ownership of products but rather encourage materialist consumers to seek out transformative and hedonic experiences that are expected to improve their self-image and well-being. For Indians, materialism will lead to participation in sharing-based programs through increased perceived utility. Managerial and theoretical implications are discussed.},

@article{choi_2019_values_of_food_leftover_sharing_platforms_in_the_sharing_economy,
	abstract = {For many food products, such as fresh vegetable and fruit, proper handling of product leftovers is critical. In recent years, food leftover sharing (FLS) platforms that can provide a means to collect the unsold food products from individual retailers and create values from them have emerged. Motivated by this real world observation, we build a single supplier multi-retailer analytical supply chain model to explore the value of this kind of FLS platform. In the decentralized supply chain setting, we prove that the presence of FLS platform is beneficial to the retailers, the supplier, the consumers and the environment. Whether it benefits the supply chain economically depends on the logistics costs (incurred from the food product leftover collection by the FLS platform). We extend the analysis to the case with a centralized supply chain and show that the FLS platform is guaranteed to help improve the environment, but the consumers and the supply chain are only benefited when the logistics costs are sufficiently small. Sensitivity analyses are conducted which show that for both centralized and decentralized supply chain settings, the FLS platform is especially helpful in enhancing social welfare when the unit food product leftover cost is higher, the unit benefit derived from reusing the food product leftovers is higher, or the unit logistics cost is lower. We further consider the case when the logistics cost with the use of platform is high, propose the use of government sponsors to help and provide the conditions under which this sponsor is well-justified with respect to social welfare enhancement.},

This study empirically investigates the effect of online review contents on potential guests' trust perceptions in AirBnB.com. Six thematic characteristics of accommodation experiences were found as salient themes from online review contents, and corresponding relationships regarding trust perceptions were investigated: Through content analysis and theme extraction in python, our results show the salient cognitive themes are room aesthetics, host attributes, location, repurchase intention, overall evaluation and room description. Trust perceptions were both evaluated by individual coders and predicted by a convolutional neural network. Results suggest salient themes determine trust perception: Host attributes positively lead to benevolence, location and room aesthetics positively affect ability, room description positively affects integrity, and location and host attributes determine overall trust perception.},

Through an online multilingual survey, 23,446 responses consisting of perceptions, evoked by way of free-recall, associated to Dream and Favourite Destinations, were collected. Findings point to clear structural differences between the imagery of Dream and Favourite Destinations. Additionally, a theoretical destination imagery model that offers a basis for future studies is proposed, and some managerial implications of significant relevance to destination marketing are discussed.},

Design/methodology/approach This paper makes use of a qualitative online content analysis to extract Airbnb data and to analyse guest reviews and host responses posted in the context of Malta. Findings A theoretical framework is proposed revealing six distinct themes of guest--host social practices and their sub-categories, resulting in a spectrum of dimensions of value formation. Research limitations/implications This paper collects data from Airbnb properties in Malta, with more narratives posted by guests, implying a dominance of guest views on value co-creation and co-destruction. Findings might have a limited transferability beyond similar sharing economy platforms and tourist destinations. Practical/implications The paper uncovers guest--host hospitality value creation practices, providing concrete examples as to what practices lead to distinct value formation or destruction. In addressing the lack of knowledge about value creation practices in the sharing economy, strategic implications are offered to the hospitality sector to understand the distinct value propositions Airbnb offers compared to traditional accommodation types. Originality/value The paper's contribution is its theoretical framework of value practices of guests staying at Airbnb-listed accommodations, contributing to a better understanding of the distinct value propositions underlying collaborative consumption offers in the sharing economy.},

	abstract = {The `sharing economy' is in the process of transforming numerous industries. Among these, the hotel sector is especially vulnerable to the strategic disruption that sharing platforms present. Companies such as Airbnb represent the epitome of this threat. This paper sets out to achieve two fundamental research objectives. First, it develops a set of exploratory research propositions based on a qualitative application of transaction cost theory (TCT) to the emergence of sharing platforms. Second, it offers specific strategic and tactical recommendations for the hotel industry based on the TCT analysis referred to above. The paper suggests that, in revising their business models to cope with the new competitive challenges posed by sharing platforms, hotel chains can leverage their superior capacity to deal with three key features of transactions drawn from TCT (frequency, uncertainty and asset specificity) and develop what this paper terms `integrated platforms'. By employing the TCT lens to understand the emergence of sharing platforms, this is the first study to systematically develop a theoretically grounded approach to understanding how transaction features impact the emergence of sharing platforms, and it hence has clear implications for numerous industries being impacted by these developments, not least the hotel industry.},

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of online shopping, online sellers are facing more sales opportunities and challenges in the highly-competitive e-commerce market. Sellers that can generate high customer cumulative ratings may experience higher demand and profits. We explore the question of how sellers can attain those high ratings. Using leading online shopping websites in China and the U.S., we collected data for 200 online sellers in both countries for each of 40 product categories (16,000 observations) pertaining to the sellers' respective customer cumulative ratings, history, price, and e-service offerings (customized website design, credit card payments/autopay, purchase security/seller communication, fast shipping, customer support, and refund opportunities). Via path analysis, we examine the extent to which online sellers' e-service offerings and characteristics influence customer cumulative ratings and demand. We find that the effects of online sellers' e-service offerings on customer cumulative ratings are moderated by product positioning (utilitarian/hedonic) and high/low perceived risk. Our evidence also suggests that high customer cumulative ratings positively influence demand. We discuss implications for customer online shopping behavior and online sellers' sales strategies.},

@article{girgin_2021_ranking_influencers_of_social_networks_by_semantic_kernels_and_sentiment_information,
	abstract = {Inspired by the importance of social media, a Social Network Opinion Leaders (SNOL) system has been proposed in this paper. The purpose of this system is to identify topic-based opinion leaders of social media. In order to accomplish this goal, several steps have been taken, such as data collection, data processing, data analysis, data classification, ranking of topic-based opinion leaders, and evaluation. The SNOL system has two main parts. In the first part, collected tweets are classified by semantic kernels for topic-based analysis. In the second part, leadership scores are given to each user in the network according to topic modeling and user modeling results. Leadership scores are then calculated with the formula generated and opinion leaders are determined for each category. Experiments are performed on data gathered from Twitter including 17,234,924 tweets from 38,727 users. The evaluation of opinion leader detection is a difficult job since there is no standard method for identifying opinion leaders. Therefore, the evaluation of the results of this study has been done using two different methods, retweet count and spread score, to prove that the suggested methodology outperforms the PageRank algorithm. The results have also been evaluated considering the user-topic sentiment correlation of the retrieved lists. Furthermore, SNOL has been compared against some opinion leader detection methods previously presented in the literature. The experimental results show that SNOL generates remarkably higher performance than the PageRank algorithm and other existing algorithms in the literature for nearly all topics and all selected top N opinion leaders.},

@article{altinel_2018_semantic_text_classification_a_survey_of_past_and_recent_advances,
	abstract = {Automatic text classification is the task of organizing documents into pre-determined classes, generally using machine learning algorithms. Generally speaking, it is one of the most important methods to organize and make use of the gigantic amounts of information that exist in unstructured textual format. Text classification is a widely studied research area of language processing and text mining. In traditional text classification, a document is represented as a bag of words where the words in other words terms are cut from their finer context i.e. their location in a sentence or in a document. Only the broader context of document is used with some type of term frequency information in the vector space. Consequently, semantics of words that can be inferred from the finer context of its location in a sentence and its relations with neighboring words are usually ignored. However, meaning of words, semantic connections between words, documents and even classes are obviously important since methods that capture semantics generally reach better classification performances. Several surveys have been published to analyze diverse approaches for the traditional text classification methods. Most of these surveys cover application of different semantic term relatedness methods in text classification up to a certain degree. However, they do not specifically target semantic text classification algorithms and their advantages over the traditional text classification. In order to fill this gap, we undertake a comprehensive discussion of semantic text classification vs. traditional text classification. This survey explores the past and recent advancements in semantic text classification and attempts to organize existing approaches under five fundamental categories; domain knowledge-based approaches, corpus-based approaches, deep learning based approaches, word/character sequence enhanced approaches and linguistic enriched approaches. Furthermore, this survey highlights the advantages of semantic text classification algorithms over the traditional text classification algorithms.},

@article{altinel_2017_instance_labeling_in_semi_supervised_learning_with_meaning_values_of_words,
	abstract = {In supervised learning systems; only labeled samples are used for building a classifier that is then used to predict the class labels of the unlabeled samples. However, obtaining labeled data is very expensive, time consuming and difficult in real-life practical situations as labeling a data set requires the effort of a human expert. On the other side, unlabeled data are often plentiful which makes it relatively inexpensive and easier to obtain. Semi-Supervised Learning methods strive to utilize this plentiful source of unlabeled examples to increase the learning capacity of the classifier particularly when amount of labeled examples are restricted. Since SSL techniques usually reach higher accuracy and require less human effort, they attract a substantial amount of attention both in practical applications and theoretical research. A novel semi-supervised methodology is offered in this study. This algorithm utilizes a new method to predict the class labels of unlabeled examples in a corpus and incorporate them into the training set to build a better classifier. The approach presented here depends on a meaning calculation, which computes the words' meaning scores in the scope of classes. Meaning computation is constructed on the Helmholtz principle and utilized to various applications in the field of text mining like feature extraction, information retrieval and document summarization. Nevertheless, according to the literature, ILBOM is the first work which uses meaning calculation in a semi-supervised way to construct a semantic smoothing kernel for Support Vector Machines (SVM). Evaluation of the proposed methodology is done by performing various experiments on standard textual datasets. ILBOM's experimental results are compared with three baseline algorithms including SVM using linear kernel which is one of the most frequently used algorithms in text classification field. Experimental results show that labeling unlabeled instances based on meaning scores of words to augment the training set is valuable, and increases the classification accuracy on previously unseen test instances significantly.},

Nevertheless, the short, limited and heterogeneous behaviours of individual dropouts create challenges for understanding how dropouts learn over time. Taking a systematic network perspective, this study used clickstream data to build a flow network model of collective attention to investigate how dropouts learn in XuetangX's Introduction to Psychology (2018 autumn). The results showed that the quantification of behavioural data presented a stereotypical image of dropouts, but the network analytics presented a rather different picture of how dropouts learn. Recognising the distinct roles of introductory learning resources could prevent dropping out and improve the accuracy of prediction models. Interestingly, the assessments embedded in the MOOCs performed a scaffolding role in guiding dropouts to learn. Thus, redesigning quizzes or examinations in open and flexible learning environments to construct a minimum cost network of collective attention is vital to making this online space cost effective for learners at risk.},

They are considered as a highly promising form of teaching from leading universities such as Stanford and Berkeley. However, users confront the problem of choosing among thousands of offered MOOCs. In such a scenario of severe ``information overload'', recommender systems can be very useful to recommend the right course to a user, since they base their operation on past user's log history. For example, Coursera recommends courses to users so that, they can acquire those skills, that are expected from their ideal job. These user's preferences are not expected to be independent from others choices, as users follow trends of similar behaviour. In this paper, we propose, xSVD++, where the ``x'' means that it is a multi-dimensional Matrix Factorization (MMF) model combined with Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithm, which exploits information from external resources (i.e., users' skills, courses' characteristics, etc.) to predict course trends and to perform rating predictions according to them. Our experimental results indicate that xSVD++ is superior over classic and non-negative matrix factorization algorithms and the state-of-the-art CMF, and SVD++ algorithms.},

In this paper, we propose a content-based recommendation algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN can be used to predict the latent factors from the text information of the multimedia resources. To train the CNN, its input and output should first be solved. For its input, the language model is used. For its output, we propose the latent factor model, which is regularized by L1-norm. Furthermore, the split Bregman iteration method is introduced to solve the model. The major novelty of the proposed recommendation algorithm is that the text information is used directly to make the content-based recommendation without tagging. Experimental results on public databases in terms of quantitative assessment show significant improvements over conventional methods. In addition, the split Bregman iteration method which is introduced to solve the model can greatly improve the training efficiency.},

@article{li_2021_carm_confidence_aware_recommender_model_via_review_representation_learning_and_historical_rating_behavior_in_the_online_platforms,
	abstract = {The recommendation systems in the online platforms often suffer from the rating data sparseness and information overload issues. Previous studies on this topic often leverage review information to construct an accurate user/item latent factor. To address this issue, we propose a novel confidence-aware recommender model via review representation learning and historical rating behavior in this article. It is motived that ratings are consistent with reviews in terms of user preferences, and reviews often contain misleading comments (e.g., fake good reviews, fake bad reviews). To this end, the interaction latent factor of user and item in the framework is constructed by exploiting review information interactivity. Then, the confidence matrix, which measures the relationship between the rating outliers and misleading reviews, is employed to further improve the model accuracy and reduce the impact of misleading reviews on the model. Furthermore, the loss function is constructed by maximum a posteriori estimation theory. Finally, the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm is introduced to optimize the loss function. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets empirically demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method also further promotes the application in learning resource adaptation. The source Python code will be available upon request.},

	abstract = {The growing popularity of massively accessed Web applications that store and analyze large amounts of data, being Facebook, Twitter and Google Search some prominent examples of such applications, have posed new requirements that greatly challenge traditional RDBMS. In response to this reality, a new way of creating and manipulating data stores, known as NoSQL databases, has arisen. This paper reviews implementations of NoSQL databases in order to provide an understanding of current tools and their uses. First, NoSQL databases are compared with traditional RDBMS and important concepts are explained. Only databases allowing to persist data and distribute them along different computing nodes are within the scope of this review. Moreover, NoSQL databases are divided into different types: Key-Value, Wide-Column, Document-oriented and Graph-oriented. In each case, a comparison of available databases is carried out based on their most important features.},

	abstract = {This paper examines content-based recommendation in domains exhibiting sequential topical structure. An example is educational video, including Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in which knowledge builds within and across courses. Conventional content-based or collaborative filtering recommendation methods do not exploit courses'sequential nature. We describe a system for video recommendation that combines topic-based video representation with sequential pattern mining of inter-topic relationships. Unsupervised topic modeling provides a scalable and domain-independent representation. We mine inter-topic relationships from manually constructed syllabi that instructors provide to guide students through their courses. This approach also allows the inclusion of multi-video sequences among the recommendation results. Integrating the resulting sequential information with content-level similarity provides relevant as well as diversified recommendations. Quantitative evaluation indicates that the proposed system, SeqSense, recommends fewer redundant videos than baseline methods, and instead emphasizes results consistent with mined topic transitions.},

However, the relatively low completion rates of MOOC participants has been a central criticism in the popular discourse. Some studies point to up to 90{\%} evasion in some courses. The lack of knowledge in relation to course prerequisites (background gaps) is one of the reasons that reduce the completion rate. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes the use of a Linked Courses structure to provide support to students. In this proposal, before starting a course, the background gaps of each student are identified and a personalized set of support courses is recommended to help him.

	abstract = {The consolidation of recommendation systems in a big data era brings opportunities in different scenarios to customize methods that recommend data. In the scenarios of the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) ecosystems, these recommenders mainly support students in choosing the best courses from the platforms. However, the expansion of course platforms and the scarcity of student data increases the difficulty in finding courses, or even part of courses, that fill a given knowledge gap. In this paper, we propose a recommendation system to support students in finding the best modules or courses in these ecosystems. First, topic modeling techniques were implemented with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to find similarities between multiple MOOCs providers. Then, a content-based recommendation provides recommendations to a user interested in acquiring new knowledge, based on a history extraction on those platforms. We evaluate our approach through an experiment with real data collected in multiple MOOCs providers. In addition, by comparing the NMF approach with a baseline Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique, we verify the model effectiveness and show that our system is useful to this context.},

@inproceedings{jing_2017_guess_you_like_course_recommendation_in_moocs,
	abstract = {Recommending courses to online students is a fundamental and also challenging issue in MOOCs. Not exactly like recommendation in traditional online systems, students who enrolled the same course may have very different purposes and with very different backgrounds. For example, one may want to study "data mining" after studying the course of "big data analytics" because the former is a prerequisite course of the latter, while some other may choose "data mining" simply because of curiosity.Employing the complete data from XuetangX1, one of the largest MOOCs in China, we conduct a systematic investigation on the problem of student behavior modeling for course recommendation. We design a content-aware algorithm framework using content based users' access behaviors to extract user-specific latent information to represent students' interest profile. We also leverage the demographics and course prerequisite relation to better reveal users' potential choice. Finally, we develop a course recommendation algorithm based on the user interest, demographic profiles and course prerequisite relation using collaborative filtering strategy. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs much better than several baselines (over 2X by MRR). We have deployed the recommendation algorithm onto the platform XuetangX as a new feature, which significantly helps improve the course recommendation performance (+24.6\% by click rate) comparing with the recommendation strategy previously used in the system.},

Attention was gauged by quantifying the relative increase in Twitter messages about climate change in the local area around the time of each event. Coastal floods, droughts, wildfires, strong wind, hail, excessive heat, extreme cold, and heavy snow events all had detectable effects. Attention was reliably higher directly after events began, compared to directly before. Financial damage associated with the weather events had a positive and significant effect on attention, although the effect was small. The abnormality of each weather event's occurrence compared to local historical activity was also a significant predictor. In particular and in line with past research, relative abnormalities in temperature (local warming) generated attention to climate change. In contrast, wind speed was predictive of attention to climate change in absolute levels. These results can be useful to predict short-term attention to climate change for strategic climate communications and to better forecast long-term climate policy support.},

@inproceedings{akbik_2018_contextual_string_embeddings_for_sequence_labeling,
	abstract = {Recent advances in language modeling using recurrent neural networks have made it viable to model language as distributions over characters. By learning to predict the next character on the basis of previous characters, such models have been shown to automatically internalize linguistic concepts such as words, sentences, subclauses and even sentiment. In this paper, we propose to leverage the internal states of a trained character language model to produce a novel type of word embedding which we refer to as contextual string embeddings. Our proposed embeddings have the distinct properties that they (a) are trained without any explicit notion of words and thus fundamentally model words as sequences of characters, and (b) are contextualized by their surrounding text, meaning that the same word will have different embeddings depending on its contextual use. We conduct a comparative evaluation against previous embeddings and find that our embeddings are highly useful for downstream tasks: across four classic sequence labeling tasks we consistently outperform the previous state-of-the-art. In particular, we significantly outperform previous work on English and German named entity recognition (NER), allowing us to report new state-of-the-art F1-scores on the CoNLL03 shared task. We release all code and pre-trained language models in a simple-to-use framework to the research community, to enable reproduction of these experiments and application of our proposed embeddings to other tasks: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair},

@article{hahnel_2020_emotional_foundations_of_the_public_climate_change_divide,
	abstract = { The worldwide rise of climate skeptical political leaders endangers sorely needed political efforts to mitigate climate change. In addition, climate skepticism expressed by the political elites may spread to the electorate, thus ultimately affecting mitigation actions at the population level. It is crucial to better understand the psychological mechanisms underlying elite influences on public opinion formation and polarization. Here we show how affective processes contribute to these top-down influences using longitudinal data in the context of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Findings revealed a general decrease in climate change beliefs immediately after the presidential election (November 2016). We moreover found an increase in positive emotions and a decrease in negative emotions toward the Republican Party after the election of President Trump. Most importantly, the positive emotional shift towards the Republican Party mediated the decrease in climate change beliefs: Individuals with pronounced increases in positive emotions toward the Republican Party most strongly reduced their belief in climate change after the presidential election. The effect was intensified among Republican partisans, pointing towards a mechanism underlying political polarization. Using data based on a major real-world political event, our findings illustrate how partisans update their beliefs by referring to the positions of relevant political authorities. We moreover demonstrate how emotions drive top-down influences of political leaders on partisans' opinions and beliefs. Finally, our findings reveal how intensified emotions can contribute to the aggravation of the public climate change divide.},

We used and compared a variety of preprocessing techniques, vectorization methods, and numerous conventional machine learning algorithms, in order to construct classification and regression models for the given tasks. We used majority voting to combine the models{'} outputs with small Neural Networks (NN) for classification tasks and their mean for regression for improving our system{'}s performance. While these methods proved weaker than modern, deep learning models, they are still relevant in research tasks because of their low requirements on computational power and faster training.},

	abstract = {Decision support models for satisfactory restaurants have attracted numerous researchers' attention. Many extant models do not consider the active, neutral and passive information in online reviews all at once. Moreover, they ignore the effect of interdependence among criteria on tourists' decision-making. To cover these defects, this study proposes a restaurant decision support model using social information for tourists on TripAdvisor.com. The model introduces fuzzy sets to denote online reviews and utilizes Bonferroni mean to consider interdependence among criteria. Furthermore, it uses a novel similarity measurement which can handle sparse data in fuzzy environments. To validate the model, we conduct a case study of TripAdvisor.com which compares the proposed model with four other models. The performance of each model is evaluated by the metric called the mean absolute error. The study shows that the proposed model can effectively support tourists' decision-making and it performs better than the other four models.},

@article{zhang_2018_mcrs_a_course_recommendation_system_for_moocs,
	abstract = {With the popularization development of MOOC platform, the number of online courses grows rapidly. Efficient and appropriate course recommendation can improve learning efficiency. Traditional recommendation system is applied to the closed educational environment in which the quantity of courses and users is relatively stable. Recommendation model and algorithm cannot directly be applied to MOOC platform efficiently. With the light of the characteristics of MOOC platform, MCRS proposed in this paper has made great improvement in the course recommendation model and recommendation algorithm. MCRS is based on distributed computation framework. The basic algorithm of MCRS is distributed association rules mining algorithm, which based on the improvement of Apriori algorithm. In addition, it is useful to mine the hidden courses rules in course enrollment data. Firstly, the data is pre-processed into a standard form by Hadoop. It aims to improve the efficiency of the basic algorithm. Then it mines association rules of the standard data by Spark. Consequently, course recommendation information is transferred into MySQL through Sqoop, which makes timely feedback and improves user's courses retrieval efficiency. Finally, to validate the efficiency of MCRS, a series of experiments are carried out on Hadoop and Spark, and the results shows that MCRS is more efficient than traditional Apriori algorithm and Apriori algorithm based on Hadoop, and the MCRS is suitable for current MOOC platform.},

It is difficult to sequence learning objects manually due to their abundant availability and the numerous combinations possible. An adaptive e-learning system that offers a personalized learning path would enhance the academic performance of learners. The main challenge in providing a personalized learning path is finding the right match between individual characteristics and learning content sequences. This paper presents a collaborative optimization algorithm, combining ant colony optimization and a genetic algorithm to provide learners with a personalized learning path. The proposed algorithm utilizes the stochastic nature of ant colony optimization and exploration characteristics of the genetic algorithm to build an optimal solution. Performance of the proposed algorithm has been assessed by conducting qualitative and quantitative experiments. This study establishes that the hybrid approach provides a better solution than the traditional approach.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, technology is affecting every aspect of our society in different manner. However, the technology impact is more tangible in the field of education. Technological advances are transforming the way education is being delivered. Courses are not limited for those who are attending university or school classes. The proliferation of Web Technologies and the exploration of the possibilities of Technology Enhance Learning (TEL) led to the development of many learning solutions and recently to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). MOOCs are capable of providing several ten thousands of learners with access to courses over the web. Recently, there are many MOOCs providers/platforms with different features and characteristics. Online learners are exposed to various challenges with this excess of those MOOCs providers. This paper presents a system that is built in the top of MOOCs providers to act as a single point of access to those providers. This system is twofold: first, it will improve the learning process for any online learner in a way that satisfies the learner needs when searching for suitable courses among different providers; It will help users not to be lost in the overwhelming offers of MOOCs. Second, it will recommend courses related to the previous experiences of its users.},

@article{li_2022_key_factors_in_mooc_pedagogy_based_on_nlp_sentiment_analysis_of_learner_reviews_what_makes_a_hit,
	abstract = {MOOC platforms have seen significant membership growth in recent years. MOOCs are leading the education world that has been digitized, remote, and highly competitive, and the competition is intense in the MOOC world. Based on the observation for top-rated MOOCs, this study proposes a research question, ``What makes a great MOOC? What makes a hit?'' To explore the answers, this study applies a crowdsourcing approach and interprets the semantics of reviews for the top-rated courses on Coursera.org. The paper has multiple steps and findings relevant to MOOC programs at universities worldwide. First, through exploratory analysis of learner reviews and expert judgment, this study identifies two distinct course categories focusing on learners' outcome intent, namely knowledge-seeking MOOCs and skill-seeking MOOCs. Further, this study uses a topical ontology of keywords and sentiment techniques to derive the intent of learners based on their comments. Through sentiment analysis and correlation analysis, it shows that knowledge-seeking MOOCs are driven by the quality of course design and materials. Skill-seeking MOOCs are driven by the instructor and their ability to present lectures and integrate course materials and assignments. This crowdsourcing method obtains the insights from large samples of learners' reviews without the priming or self-selection biases of open surveys or interviews. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging online learner reviews and offer practical implications for what truly ``makes a hit'' for top-rated MOOCs.},

A questionnaire based on Constructivism Theory and the Technology Acceptance Model was employed as the main data collection method, which was distributed to 723 research students in five Malaysian research universities. Based on the obtained results, male and female students' satisfaction of social media use for collaborative learning and engagement positively affected their learning performance, although in the case of females, they were not fully satisfied with perceived ease of use and usefulness. The study concludes that overall, active collaborative learning and engagement through social media enriches the learning activities of students and facilitates group discussions, and hence, their use should be encouraged in learning and teaching processes in higher education institutions.},

	abstract = {Nowadays online reviews play a significant role in influencing the decision of consumers. Consumers show their experience and information about product quality in their reviews. Product Reviews from Amazon to Restaurant Reviews from Yelp are facing problems with fake reviews and fake numeric ratings. Online reviews typically consist of qualitative (text format) and quantitative (rating) formats. In the case of Google Play store fake numeric ratings can play a big role in the success of apps. People tend to believe that a high-star rating may be significantly attached with a good review. However, user star level rating information does not usually match with text format of review. Despite many efforts to resolve this issue, Apple App Store and Google Play Store are still facing this problem. This study proposes a novel Google App numeric reviews & ratings contradiction prediction framework using Deep Learning approaches. The framework consists of two phases. In the first phase, the polarity of reviews are predicted using sentiment analysis tool to build ground truth. In the second phase, star ratings are predicted from text format of reviews after training deep learning models on ground truth obtained in the first phase. Experimental results demonstrate that based on actual user reviews the proposed framework significantly predicts unbiased star rating of app.},

We suggest that the Anna Karenina principle positing a greater variability of the factors leading to business failure as opposed to those leading to success can be applied to the domain of visitors' reviews of historic and cultural attractions. The larger variability of issues in reviews of dissatisfied visitors is likely to result in limitations for automated topic modeling. We confirm our proposition using TripAdvisor reviews of the Terracotta Army museum in China, and validate the outcome with two additional sites. The study strongly suggests that application of unsupervised topic mining algorithms to negative reviews may be problematic and the results should be treated with caution. The main themes of dissatisfaction of visitors to all three sites are reported and practical implications for management of the attractions are discussed.},

	abstract = {In real datasets, most are unbalanced. Data imbalance can be defined as the number of instances in some classes greatly exceeds the number of instances in other classes. Whether in the field of data mining or machine learning, data imbalance can have adverse effects. At present, the methods to solve the problem of data imbalance can be divided into data-level methods, algorithm-level methods and hybrid methods. In this paper, we propose a weighted hybrid ensemble method for classifying imbalanced data in binary classification tasks, called WHMBoost. In the framework of the boosting algorithm, the presented method combines two data sampling methods and two base classifiers, and each sampling method and each base classifier is assigned corresponding weights, which makes them have better complementary advantages. The performance of WHMBoost has been evaluated on 40 benchmark imbalanced datasets with state of the art ensemble methods like AdaBoost, RUSBoost, SMOTEBoost using AUC, F-Measure and Geometric Mean as the performance evaluation criteria. Experimental results show significant improvement over the other methods and it can be concluded that WHMBoost is a promising and effective algorithm to deal with imbalance datasets.},

@article{yan_2020_a_hybrid_scheme_based_one_vs_all_decision_trees_for_multi_class_classification_tasks,
	abstract = {Decision tree algorithms have been proved to be a powerful and popular approach in classification tasks. However, they do not have reasonable classification performance in multi-class scenarios. In the present study, decision tree algorithms are combined with the one-vs-all (OVA) binarization technique to improve the generalization capabilities of the scheme. However, unlike previous literature that has focused on aggregation strategies, the present study is focused on the process of building base classifiers over the OVA scheme. A novel split criterion, entitled by the splitting point correction matrix (SPCM), is proposed in this regards, which can effectively deal with the unbalance problem caused by the OVA scheme. The SPCM is a kind of hybrid scheme, which integrates distribution and permutation information from the training data at each splitting point. Therefore, compared to other classical split criteria, such as the C4.5, the proposed method can make the right choice about the optimal splitting point at the root or internal nodes from multi-angle. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the SPCM approach, extensive experiments are carried out compared to the classical and state-of-the-art methods. The experiments are performed on sixteen datasets, where the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed method is verified. It is concluded that the SPCM method not only has excellent classification performance but also produces a more compact decision tree. Moreover, it is found that the SPCM method has especially a considerable improvement in the depth of tree.},

@article{shan_2020_learn_a_novel_incremental_learning_method_for_text_classification,
	abstract = {Deep learning is an effective method for extracting the underlying information in text. However, it performs better on closed datasets and is less effective in real-world scenarios for text classification. As the data is updated and the amount of data increases, the models need to be retrained, in what is often a long training process. Therefore, we propose a novel incremental learning strategy to solve these problems. Our method, called Learn#, includes four components: a Student model, a reinforcement learning (RL) module, a Teacher model, and a discriminator model. The Student models first extract the features from the texts, then the RL module filters the results of multiple Student models. After that, the Teacher model reclassifies the filtered results to obtain the final texts category. To avoid increasing the Student models unlimitedly as the number of samples increases, the discriminator model is used to filter the Student models based on their similarity. The Learn# method has the advantage of a shorter training time than the One-Time model, because it only needs to train a new Student model each time, without changing the existing Student models. Furthermore, it can also obtain feedback during application and tune the models parameters over time. Experiments on different datasets show that our method for text classification outperforms many traditional One-Time methods, reducing training time by nearly 80%.},

The hotel attributes given focus include: (a) Service, (b) Cleanliness, (c) Room, (d) Sleep Quality, (e) Location, and (f) Value. In total, 353 hotels with 2,020 usable individual complaining reviews representing five different continents and 63 nationalities were collected for the analysis, which was conducted using a manual coding approach. Results indicate that online complaining behavior is influenced by cultural background. Asian and non-Asian travelers appear to place a similar emphasis on Value for money. However, Asian guests are more likely to complain about Service, while non-Asian guests are more likely to complaint about Cleanliness, Room, Sleep Quality, and Location. Additionally, online complaining behavior varies between different classes of hotel. Guests of high-class hotels are more likely to complain about Service and Value, while guests of low-class hotels are more likely to complain about Cleanliness, Room, Sleep Quality, and Location. This study contributes to the realm of hotel management by providing a better understanding of how customers from different cultural backgrounds are likely to perceive different hotel attributes.},

	abstract = {Tree-based machine learning models such as random forests, decision trees and gradient boosted trees are popular nonlinear predictive models, yet comparatively little attention has been paid to explaining their predictions. Here we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions. (1) A polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. (2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model's performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains.},

While the success of the neural models came from their high expressiveness, the uninterpretability problem still one of their main drawbacks, which can have a negative side effect on the whole learning process. A good candidate to reduce the uninterpretability is using Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL), which showed a strong performance in dealing with this problem. Moreover, sparsity is another major problem of the most previous recommendation systems. In this paper, we introduce a new recommender system framework based on the generalized distillation principle that combines two modeling approaches: PSL for the knowledge-driven modeling approach and deep neural networks for the data-driven approach. Experimental results on publicly available datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art based on deep neural networks emphasizing the utility of PSL rules in handling inconsistencies, reducing the uninterpretability of the neural models and shows promising results in dealing with sparsity.},

Despite many international mall-shopper studies, only few have compared countries using uniform constructs and descriptors. The present study sought to compare shopper segments from four countries----England, France, Ghana, and Morocco----to examine the impact of national culture (reflected through Hofstede's individualism/collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, long-/short-term orientation, and indulgence/restraint) and economic capacity (purchasing power parity) on shopper behavior. Findings suggest that culture shapes the nature of shoppers' profiles. However, purchase behavior and spending rates impacted more by culture in rich countries and more by the economic situation in poor countries. The implication is that international retailers and mall managers should consider national culture as well as economic factors in their global operations.},

	abstract = {This paper applies a smart tourism approach to tourist destination marketing campaigns through the analysis of tourists' reviews from TripAdvisor to identify significant patterns in the data. The proposed method combines topic modelling using Structured Topic Analysis with sentiment polarity, information on culture, and purchasing power of tourists for the development of a Decision Tree (DT) to predict tourists' experience. For data collection and analysis, several custom-made python scripts were used. Data underwent integration, cleansing, incomplete data processing, and imbalance data treatments prior to being analysed. The patterns that emerged from the DT are expressed in terms of rules that highlight variable combinations leading to negative or positive sentiment. The generated predictive model can be used by destination management to tailor marketing strategy by targeting tourists who are more likely to be satisfied at the destination according to their needs.},

To this end, we collected and analyzed 113,685 hotel reviews and responses and their semantic and syntactic relations. We are among the first to use visual analytics and deep learning-based natural language processing to empirically identify managerial responses. The empirical results indicate that our proposed multi-feature fusion, convolutional neural network model can make different types of data complement each other, thereby outperforming the comparisons. The visualization results can also be used to improve the performance of the proposed model and provide insights into response strategies, which further shows the theoretical and technical contributions of this study.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

Demographics and lodging preference do not affect eWOM behaviors. Economic incentives also have no effect on eWOM behaviors, which suggests that good reviews cannot be bought. The performance of core attributes can improve eWOM activities and eWOM praise, but the performance of facilitating attributes helps only with eWOM praise.},

This study used two national level inbound tourist samples, i.e., Tourism Research Australia's 2017 International Visitor Survey holiday/pleasure travellers' sample and the Hong Kong Tourist Satisfaction Index Project 2016 sample, to test the relationships between Hofstede's six cultural dimensions (Power Distance, Individualism/Collectivism, Masculinity/Femininity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long Term Orientation/Short Term Normative Orientation, and Indulgence/Restraint) and visitor satisfaction. Bivariate correlation with bootstrapping tests show consistent correlations between four of the six cultural dimensions and visitor satisfaction across the two samples. While Individualism and Indulgence are found to be positively related to visitor satisfaction, Power Distance and Long Term Orientation are negatively related to visitor satisfaction. The findings are validated with a further test involving the concept of cultural distance. This study contributes to the literature by providing solid evidence on the relation between culture and visitor satisfaction. Calls for future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {We propose a new multiple criteria decision aiding approach for market segmentation that integrates preference analysis and segmentation decision within a unified framework. The approach employs an additive value function as the preference model and requires consumers to provide pairwise comparisons of some products as the preference information. To analyze each consumer's preferences, the approach applies the disaggregation paradigm and the stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis to derive a set of value functions according to the preference information provided by each consumer. Then, each consumer's preferences can be represented by the distribution of possible rankings of products and associated support degrees by applying the derived value functions. On the basis of preference analysis, a new metric is proposed to measure the similarity between preferences of different consumers, and a hierarchical clustering algorithm is developed to perform market segmentation. To help firms serve consumers from different segments with targeted marketing policies and appropriate products, the approach proposes to work out a representative value function and the univocal ranking of products for each consumer so that products that rank in the front of the list can be presented to her/him. Finally, an illustrative example of a market segmentation problem details the application of the proposed approach.},

While the methodology applies to optimization problems in general, most TS applications have been and continue to be in discrete optimization.

The underlying philosophy is that an effective search for optimal solutions should involve a flexible process that responds to the objective function landscape in a manner that allows it to learn appropriate directions to exploit specific areas of the solution space and useful departures to explore new terrain. The adaptive memory structures of tabu search enable the implementation of procedures that are capable of searching effectively and produce solutions of suitable quality within reasonable computational effort.},

When a metal is heated to a sufficiently high temperature, its atoms undergo disordered movements of large amplitude. If one now cools the metal down progressively, the atoms reduce their movement and tend to stabilize around fixed positions in a regular crystal structure with minimal energy. In this state, in which internal structural constraints are minimized, ductility is improved and the metal becomes easier to work. This slow cooling process is called annealing by metallurgists and it is to be contrasted with the quenching process, which consists of a rapid cooling down of the metal or alloy.},

@article{blut_2018_testing_retail_marketing_mix_effects_on_patronage_a_meta_analysis,
	abstract = {Retailers have always worked to establish close relationships with customers through the retail marketing mix. Thus, the literature has a long tradition of testing the effects of various instruments on retail patronage. This meta-study synthesizes prior research into one comprehensive framework. We use 14,895 effect sizes reported by more than 239,000 shoppers from 41 countries extracted from 350 independent samples, to test the impact of 24 marketing-mix instruments on retail patronage. Specifically, we investigate the direct and indirect effects of these instruments on store satisfaction, word of mouth, patronage intention, and behavior. Product and brand management related instruments display the strongest effects on most outcome variables, whereas price, communication, service and incentive management instruments affect only selected outcomes. Distribution management turns out to be of secondary importance. However, the effectiveness of these instruments depends on the specific shopping context (food/non-food, shopping frequency, single store/agglomeration, hedonic/utilitarian), the retail environment (gross domestic product, country innovativeness, retail sales share, retail employment, Internet era), and the employed method (participant type, study design, data source). Specifically, we reveal most differences for hedonic shopping environments and developed countries. Also, the store's advertising and atmosphere have gained importance in the Internet era, while purchase incentives, in-store orientation, and store location have lost relevance. This study contributes to a synoptic understanding of the comparable effectiveness of retail marketing instruments on retail patronage. It offers insights into the effectiveness of marketing-mix instruments and provides guidance on whether and when to invest in them. It also presents an agenda for future research on marketing-mix instruments.},

@article{gambhir_2017_recent_automatic_text_summarization_techniques_a_survey,
	abstract = {As information is available in abundance for every topic on internet, condensing the important information in the form of summary would benefit a number of users. Hence, there is growing interest among the research community for developing new approaches to automatically summarize the text. Automatic text summarization system generates a summary, i.e. short length text that includes all the important information of the document. Since the advent of text summarization in 1950s, researchers have been trying to improve techniques for generating summaries so that machine generated summary matches with the human made summary. Summary can be generated through extractive as well as abstractive methods. Abstractive methods are highly complex as they need extensive natural language processing. Therefore, research community is focusing more on extractive summaries, trying to achieve more coherent and meaningful summaries. During a decade, several extractive approaches have been developed for automatic summary generation that implements a number of machine learning and optimization techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent text summarization extractive approaches developed in the last decade. Their needs are identified and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in a comparative manner. A few abstractive and multilingual text summarization approaches are also covered. Summary evaluation is another challenging issue in this research field. Therefore, intrinsic as well as extrinsic both the methods of summary evaluation are described in detail along with text summarization evaluation conferences and workshops. Furthermore, evaluation results of extractive summarization approaches are presented on some shared DUC datasets. Finally this paper concludes with the discussion of useful future directions that can help researchers to identify areas where further research is needed.},

@article{li_2017_feature_selection_a_data_perspective,
	abstract = {Feature selection, as a data preprocessing strategy, has been proven to be effective and efficient in preparing data (especially high-dimensional data) for various data-mining and machine-learning problems. The objectives of feature selection include building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data-mining performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. The recent proliferation of big data has presented some substantial challenges and opportunities to feature selection. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in feature selection research. Motivated by current challenges and opportunities in the era of big data, we revisit feature selection research from a data perspective and review representative feature selection algorithms for conventional data, structured data, heterogeneous data and streaming data. Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for conventional data, we categorize them into four main groups: similarity-based, information-theoretical-based, sparse-learning-based, and statistical-based methods. To facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present an open source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (http://featureselection.asu.edu/). Also, we use it as an example to show how to evaluate feature selection algorithms. At the end of the survey, we present a discussion about some open problems and challenges that require more attention in future research.},

	abstract = {Blockchain (BC), the technology behind the Bitcoin crypto-currency system - is starting to be adopted for ensuring enhanced security and privacy in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Fervent research is currently being focused in both academia and industry in this domain. Proof-of-Work (PoW), a cryptographic puzzle, plays a vital r{\^o}le in ensuring BC security by maintaining a digital ledger of transactions, which are considered to be incorruptible. Furthermore, BC uses a changeable Public Key (PK) to record the identity of users -- thus providing an extra layer of privacy. Not only in crypto-currency has the successful adoption of the BC been implemented, but also in multifaceted non-monetary systems, such as in: distributed storage systems, proof-of-location and healthcare. Recent research articles and projects/applications were surveyed to assess the implementation of the BC for IoT Security and identify associated challenges and propose solutions for BC enabled enhanced security for the IoT ecosystem.},

@inproceedings{zhang_2018_aggregating_neural_word_embeddings_for_document_representation,
	abstract = {Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have shown that semantically meaningful representations of words can be efficiently acquired by distributed models. In such a case, a text document can be viewed as a bag-of-word-embeddings (BoWE), and the remaining question is how to obtain a fixed-length vector representation of the document for efficient document process. Beyond those heuristic aggregation methods, recent work has shown that one can leverage the Fisher kernel (FK) framework to generate document representations based on BoWE in a principled way. In this work, words are embedded into a Euclidean space by latent semantic indexing (LSI), and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is employed as the generative model for nonlinear FK-based aggregation. In this work, we propose an alternate FK-based aggregation method for document representation based on neural word embeddings. As we know, neural embedding models have been proven significantly better performance in word representations than LSI, where semantic relations between neural word embeddings are typically measured by cosine similarity rather than Euclidean distance. Therefore, we introduce a mixture of Von Mises-Fisher distributions (moVMF) as the generative model of neural word embeddings, and derive a new FK-based aggregation method for document representation based on BoWE. We report document classification, clustering and retrieval experiments and demonstrate that our model can produce state-of-the-art performance as compared with existing baseline methods.},

@article{belford_2018_stability_of_topic_modeling_via_matrix_factorization,
	abstract = {Topic models can provide us with an insight into the underlying latent structure of a large corpus of documents. A range of methods have been proposed in the literature, including probabilistic topic models and techniques based on matrix factorization. However, in both cases, standard implementations rely on stochastic elements in their initialization phase, which can potentially lead to different results being generated on the same corpus when using the same parameter values. This corresponds to the concept of ``instability'' which has previously been studied in the context of k-means clustering. In many applications of topic modeling, this problem of instability is not considered and topic models are treated as being definitive, even though the results may change considerably if the initialization process is altered. In this paper we demonstrate the inherent instability of popular topic modeling approaches, using a number of new measures to assess stability. To address this issue in the context of matrix factorization for topic modeling, we propose the use of ensemble learning strategies. Based on experiments performed on annotated text corpora, we show that a K-Fold ensemble strategy, combining both ensembles and structured initialization, can significantly reduce instability, while simultaneously yielding more accurate topic models.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we examine the utility of script analysis for predicting the helpfulness of online customer reviews. We employ the lens of cognitive scripts and posit that people share a cognitive script for what constitutes a helpful review in a given domain. Conceptually, a script includes the salient elements that readers look for before determining whether a review is helpful. To operationalize the construct of cognitive script, we seek the help of human annotators and ask them to highlight phrases that they believe are important for determining review helpfulness. The words in the annotated phrases are collected and become part of the script lexicon for a given domain. The lexicon entries represent the shared conception of essential elements, which are key to the evaluation of review helpfulness. We employ the words in the script lexicon as features in a text regression model to predict review helpfulness. Furthermore, we develop and empirically validate a new approach for combining script analysis and dimension reduction. The purpose of the study is to propose a new method to predict review helpfulness and to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the scripts-enriched model. To demonstrate the efficacy of the scripts-enriched model, we compare it with benchmark models -- a Baseline model and a bag-of-words (BOW) model. The results show that the scripts-enriched text regression model not only produces the highest accuracy, but also the lowest training, testing, and feature selection times.},

@article{lee_2018_assessment_of_airport_service_quality_a_complementary_approach_to_measure_perceived_service_quality_based_on_google_reviews,
	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that user-generated online contents can be used as an alternative data source for assessing airport service quality, which effectively complements and cross-validates the conventional service quality surveys. We apply sentiment analysis and topic modeling technique to 42,137 reviews collected from Google Maps. The results are compared to the well-publicized ASQ ratings conducted by Airport Council International. The sentiment scores computed from the textual Google reviews are very good predictors of the associated Google star ratings, with rs(96) = 0.89, p < .01 in 2016. The correlation could be further improved (rs(96) = 0.90) by customizing the sentiment lexicon leveraging the information gained from the previous year's analysis. Also, both the sentiment scores and Google star ratings are found to have a reasonably strong association with the ASQ ratings, with rs(78) = 0.63, p < .01 and rs(78) = 0.64, p < .01, respectively, in 2016, excluding outliers. These results indicate that the online reviews provide a good proxy for airport service quality ratings and an effective means to cross-validate the conventional industry standard survey results. Further, the study extracts 25 latent topics from the Google reviews through a topic modeling analysis. The 25 topics show good correspondence with the ASQ service attributes, suggesting that the ASQ program effectively covers all the service quality attributes of airport users. Also, further analysis indicates that the relative importance of service attributes varies depending on the size of the airports and that some ASQ service attributes may not be relevant anymore for most passengers.},

Travelers not only reserve hotels and airline tickets online, but also exchange travel information and descriptions of pleasant or unpleasant travel experiences through online review sites and personal travel blogs. In spite of the increasing use of online channels, application of online text data has been limited since the volume of the data set is too large to analyze manually and comprehensively. With recent technological advances in processing big data online, consumer-generated information can be automatically analyzed by artificial intelligence. As an aspect of smart tourism, this study applied the sentiment analysis method to analyze travelers' online reviews of Paris. A total of 19,835 pieces of review data collected from a traveler review site (www.virtualtourist.com) were processed. All reviews were grouped into 14 categories as follows: overview, restaurants, sightseeing, hotels, things to do, night life, transportation, shopping, sporting & outdoors, favorites, off the beaten path, what to pack, tourist traps, warnings and danger, and local customs. Tourists' perception about the service in each category was successfully measured, and as an illustration, we chose ``transportation'' category that reported relatively low level of service quality for post-hoc analysis to reveal why tourists feel negatively about the transportation service.},

	abstract = {Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications on real-life textual content require a suitable fit for purpose corpora, which can accommodate the ambiguity of the domain. Researchers in the field managed to synthesize gold-standard corpora in many domains and for varying tasks, assisted by domain experts and linguists. The wealth of information buried in free-text electronic documents in healthcare systems presents itself as a leading contender for NLP applications. In this literature review, the efforts to come up and utilize a clinically annotated corpus in a particular healthcare information extraction task are explored. Those efforts can be more pronounced when done on a new language with limited existing gold-standard clinical references. A great number of people around the globe interact with healthcare systems in languages other than English. Advancing the Clinical NLP research in their languages will propel the general progress in the field and potential healthcare advantages considerably. For the purposes of this review, we considered three major world languages: Spanish, Italian, and Chinese. This led to considering the research question to be about the viability of the creation or utilization of a gold-standard clinical corpus in a language other than English and how it can contribute in performing a complex clinical language mining task. The implementations reviewed in these languages considered varying approaches to overcome complexities in biomedical NLP in these languages. This study managed to highlight novel solutions to complex tasks and found that efforts in these languages can be highly successful if a non-English medical corpus is created from scratch, off-the-shelf tools are used or machine translation is considered to bridge the gap in biomedical NLP domain-specific lingual resources in these languages.},

@inproceedings{devlin_2019_bert_pre_training_of_deep_bidirectional_transformers_for_language_understanding,
	abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

@article{gangavarapu_2020_predicting_icd_9_code_groups_with_fuzzy_similarity_based_supervised_multi_label_classification_of_unstructured_clinical_nursing_notes,
	abstract = {In hospitals, caregivers are trained to chronicle the subtle changes in the clinical conditions of a patient at regular intervals, for enabling decision-making. Caregivers' text-based clinical notes are a significant source of rich patient-specific data, that can facilitate effective clinical decision support, despite which, this treasure-trove of data remains largely unexplored for supporting the prediction of clinical outcomes. The application of sophisticated data modeling and prediction algorithms with greater computational capacity have made disease prediction from raw clinical notes a relevant problem. In this paper, we propose an approach based on vector space and topic modeling, to structure the raw clinical data by capturing the semantic information in the nursing notes. Fuzzy similarity based data cleansing approach was used to merge anomalous and redundant patient data. Furthermore, we utilize eight supervised multi-label classification models to facilitate disease (ICD-9 code group) prediction. We present an exhaustive comparative study to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches using standard evaluation metrics. Experimental validation on MIMIC-III, an open database, underscored the superior performance of the proposed Term weighting of unstructured notes AGgregated using fuzzy Similarity (TAGS) model, which consistently outperformed the state-of-the-art structured data based approach by 7.79% in AUPRC and 1.24% in AUROC.},

The Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) eHealth 2020 continues our development of evaluation tasks and resources since 2012 to address laypeople's difficulties to retrieve and digest valid and relevant information in their preferred language to make health-centred decisions. This year's lab advertised two tasks. Task 1 on Information Extraction (IE) was new and focused on automatic clinical coding of diagnosis and procedure the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD10) codes as well as finding the corresponding evidence text snippets for clinical case documents in Spanish. Task 2 on Information Retrieval (IR) was a novel extension of the most popular and established task in the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) eHealth on Consumer Health Search (CHS). In total 55 submissions were made to these tasks. Herein, we describe the resources created for the two tasks and evaluation methodology adopted. We also summarize lab submissions and results. As in previous years, the organizers have made data and tools associated with the lab tasks available for future research and development. The ongoing substantial community interest in the tasks and their resources has led to the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) eHealth maturing as a primary venue for all interdisciplinary actors of the ecosystem for producing, processing, and consuming electronic health information.},

In this survey paper, we discuss various medical corpora and their characteristics, medical codes and present a brief overview as well as comparison of popular embeddings models. We classify clinical embeddings and discuss each embedding type in detail. We discuss various evaluation methods followed by possible solutions to various challenges in clinical embeddings.

	abstract = {This study used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to analyze pre-service teachers'views on the nature of science (NOS). This approach can be used to automate the classification of documents, and at the same time, the researcher does not need to deduce with a NOS framework prior to evaluation. Participants were 155 pre-service teachers studying at the Shandong Normal University in China. To gather our data, we used an open questionnaire, namely, the Views of Nature of Science Questionnaire---Form C (VNOS-C). LDA topic modeling was used to classify the document, which was divided into 12 topics. By comparing the LDA topic modeling results with the theoretical framework behind the VNOS-C questionnaire, we categorized these 12 topics into eight descriptive aspects of the NOS: The Empirical Nature of Scientific Knowledge, Observation, Inference, and Theoretical Entities in Science, Scientific Theories and Laws, The Theory-Laden Nature of Scientific Knowledge, The Social and Cultural Embeddedness of Scientific Knowledge, The Myth of The Scientific Method, The Tentative Nature of Scientific Knowledge, and The Nature of Scientific Theory. The results show that pre-service teachers usually hold naive or mixed views of the NOS. In addition, each aspect of NOS is not independent of each other but interrelated and influencing each other. In the future, more consideration can be given to the relationship between each aspect of NOS.},

	abstract = {Given the ubiquity of handwriting and mathematical content in human transactions, machine recognition of handwritten mathematical text and symbols has become a domain of great practical scope and significance. Recognition of mathematical expression (ME) has remained a challenging and emerging research domain, with mathematical symbol recognition (MSR) as a requisite step in the entire recognition process. Many variations in writing styles and existing dissimilarities among the wide range of symbols and recurring characters make the recognition tasks strenuous even for Optical Character Recognition. The past decade has witnessed the emergence of recognition techniques and the peaking interest of several researchers in this evolving domain. In light of the current research status associated with recognizing handwritten math symbols, a systematic review of the literature seems timely. This article seeks to provide a complete systematic analysis of recognition techniques, models, datasets, sub-stages, accuracy metrics, and accuracy details in an extracted form as described in the literature. A systematic literature review conducted in this study includes pragmatic studies until the year 2021, and the analysis reveals Support Vector Machine (SVM) to be the most dominating recognition technique and symbol recognition rate to be most frequently deployed accuracy measure and other interesting results in terms of segmentation, feature extraction and datasets involved are vividly represented. The statistics of mathematical symbols-related papers are shown, and open problems are identified for more advanced research. Our study focused on the key points of earlier research, present work, and the future direction of MSR.},

Here we analyze open-ended textual responses of citizens and scientists concerning their associations with the terms ``economic growth'' and ``green growth''. We derive from the responses a number of topics and examine how associations differ across distinct opinion segments of people, namely supporters of Green growth, Agrowth and Degrowth. The results indicate that the general public is more critical of the notion of economic growth than academic researchers. Citizens stress problems of corruption, social inequality, unemployment and poverty, with less variation among the three opinion segments compared to scientists. The latter more strongly emphasize the environmental consequences of economic growth. Concerning associations of scientists with the term ``green growth'', we find topics questioning its feasibility to be more likely expressed by Degrowth supporters, while topics stressing the possibility of sustainable economic growth by Green growth supporters. We find that topic polarization is stronger for scientists than citizens. Our results provide further validation for opinion clusters identified in previous studies and uncover additional insights about related views on growth and sustainability.},

@article{sakshi_2021_a_retrospective_study_on_handwritten_mathematical_symbols_and_expressions_classification_and_recognition,
	abstract = {Context:
Many scientific and technical literature documents contain MSs and MEs that are more challenging to be recognized by computers than plain text. The recognition of HMSE becomes not only an ambitious task but a motivating research area covering concepts of computer vision, pattern recognition, feature extraction, and artificial intelligence.
Objective:
The objective is to perform an extensive state of the art on the techniques and methods used for recognizing and classifying HMSE. The authors endeavor to bring out all significant findings in sub-processes, representation models, algorithms, tools, datasets, and comparative analysis of the accuracy of the recognition models.
Method:
The current research implements the standard SLR method based on a comprehensive set of 120 articles published in 21 leading journals and 39 premier conferences and workshops.
Results:
Existing literature about recognition techniques and models is classified broadly into three categories; AI technique (65%) is majorly implemented in the selected studies. The prominent sub-process `segmentation' (52%) is mostly used. The box and tree are the prevailing representation models. The popular datasets are recognized as CROHME 2014 and CROHME 2016, used by 60% of the selected studies. Masaki Nakagawa, C. Viard Guardin, Richard Zanibbi, and Harold Mouchere are the most noticed authors in ME recognition.
Conclusion:
The reviewers call for increased awareness of the potential benefits of existing and emerging recognition techniques and identify the need to develop a more accurate and semantic-based recognition model. Recommendations are given for future research.},

	abstract = {Automatic text summarization is an exertion of contriving the abridged form of a text document covering salient knowledge. Numerous statistical, linguistic, rule-based, and position-based text summarization approaches have been explored for different rich-resourced languages. For under-resourced languages such as Hindi, automatic text summarization is a challenging task and still an unsolved problem. Another issue with such languages is the unavailability of corpus and the inadequacy of the processing tools. In this paper, we proposed an extractive lexical knowledge-rich topic modeling text summarization approach for Hindi novels and stories in which we implemented four independent variants using different sentence weighting schemes. We prepared a corpus of Hindi Novels and stories since the absence of a corpus. We used a smoothing technique for edifying and variety summaries followed by evaluating the efficacy of generated summaries against three metrics (gist diversity, retention ratio, and ROUGE score). The results manifest that the proposed model produces abridge, articulate and coherent summaries. To investigate the performance of the proposed model, we simulate the experiments on the English dataset as well. Further, we compare our models with the baselines and traditional topic modeling approach, where we show that the proposed model has confessed optimal results.},

To ameliorate the current situation, all facilities and tools in this realm should be implemented to encounter this epidemic. The current study has endeavored to propose a self-assessment decision support system (DSS) for distinguishing the severity of the COVID-19 between confirmed cases to optimize the patient care process. For this purpose, a DSS has been developed by the combination of the data-driven Bayesian network (BN) and the Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM). First, all of the data are utilized to extract the evidence-based paired (EBP) relationships between symptoms and symptoms'impact probability. Then, the results are evaluated in both independent and combined scenarios. After categorizing data in the triple severity levels by self-organizing map, the EBP relationships between symptoms are extracted by BN, and their significance is achieved and ranked by FCM. The results show that the most common symptoms necessarily do not have the key role in distinguishing the severity of the COVID-19, and extracting the EBP relationships could have better insight into the severity of the disease.},

@article{leong_2021_a_meta_analysis_of_consumer_innovation_resistance_is_there_a_cultural_invariance,
	abstract = {Purpose In the literature of industrial management, the focus is normally given on examining the factors that contribute to product innovation acceptance. The advocates of ``pro-innovation bias''assume that consumers are open to new products and are willing to accept an innovative product. However, there is a high failure rate of technological innovations and most of the technological innovations were rejected due to users' resistance. Since the inception of innovation resistance theory (IRT), the number of studies that used IRT has gained much attention from scholars. However, the findings from these studies from various contexts are inconsistent, lack universality, and a clear understanding of technological innovation barriers. The study aims to determine whether the IRT theory is indeed valid and whether IRT is culturally invariant from the Eastern and Western cultures. Design/methodology/approach A meta-analysis based on a random-effects model and studies drawn from 24 countries and/or regions with a consolidated sample size of 10,463 was conducted. Cultural invariance was identified based on subgroup analysis. Moderator analysis was performed by applying the weighted linear regression. Findings The results reveal that tradition is the strongest barrier followed by the value, risk, image and usage barrier. Interestingly, there is a cultural invariance in IRT from the Eastern and Western cultures. Besides, there are significant moderating effects due to the temporal factor. Originality/value The study has contributed useful theoretical and managerial implications in advancing the product innovation literature.},

Light food has been favored by the public, especially by the young generation in recent years. Moreover, affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, consumers' awareness of a healthy diet has been improved to a certain extent. As both take-out and in-place orders for light food are growing rapidly, there are massive customer reviews left on the Meituan platform. However, massive, multi-dimensional unstructured data has not yet been fully explored. This research aims to explore the customers' focal points and sentiment polarity of the overall comments and to investigate whether there exist differences of these two aspects before and after the COVID-19. A total of 6968 light food customer reviews on the Meituan platform were crawled and finally used for data analysis. This research first conducted the fine-grained sentiment analysis and classification of the light food customer reviews via the SnowNLP technique. In addition, LDA topic modeling was used to analyze positive and negative topics of customer reviews. The experimental results were visualized and the research showed that the SnowNLP technique and LDA topic modeling achieve high performance in extracting the customers' sentiments and focal points, which provides theoretical and data support for light food businesses to improve customer service. This research contributes to the existing research on LDA modeling and light food customer review analysis. Several practical and feasible suggestions are further provided for managers in the light food industry.},

Handwritten ME recognition is challenging due to the variety of writing styles and ME formats. As a result, recognizers trained by optimizing the traditional supervision loss do not perform satisfactorily. To improve the robustness of the recognizer with respect to writing styles, in this work, we propose a novel paired adversarial learning method to learn semantic-invariant features. Specifically, our proposed model, named PAL-v2, consists of an attention-based recognizer and a discriminator. During training, handwritten MEs and their printed templates are fed into PAL-v2 simultaneously. The attention-based recognizer is trained to learn semantic-invariant features with the guide of the discriminator. Moreover, we adopt a convolutional decoder to alleviate the vanishing and exploding gradient problems of RNN-based decoder, and further, improve the coverage of decoding with a novel attention method. We conducted extensive experiments on the CROHME dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of each part of the method and achieved state-of-the-art performance.},

@article{frank_2020_a_general_framework_for_the_recognition_of_online_handwritten_graphics,
	abstract = {We revisit graph grammar and graph parsing as tools for recognizing graphics. A top-down approach for parsing families of handwritten graphics containing different kinds of symbols and of structural relations is proposed. It has been tested on two distinct domains, namely the recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions and of handwritten flowcharts. In the proposed approach, a graphic is considered as a labeled graph generated by a graph grammar. The recognition problem is translated into a graph parsing problem: Given a set of strokes (input data), a parse tree which represents the best interpretation is extracted. The graph parsing algorithm generates multiple interpretations (consistent with the grammar) that can be ranked according to a global cost function that takes into account the likelihood of symbols and structures. The parsing algorithm consists in recursively partitioning the stroke set according to rules defined in the graph grammar. To constrain the number of partitions to be evaluated, we propose the use of a hypothesis graph, built from data-driven machine learning techniques, to encode the most likely symbol and relation hypotheses. Within this approach, it is easy to relax the stroke ordering constraint allowing interspersed symbols, as opposed to some previous works. Experiments show that our method obtains accuracy comparable to methods specifically developed to recognize domain-dependent data.},

@article{le_2019_pattern_generation_strategies_for_improving_recognition_of_handwritten_mathematical_expressions,
	abstract = {Recognition of Handwritten Mathematical Expressions (HMEs) is a challenging problem because of the ambiguity and complexity of two-dimensional handwriting. Moreover, the lack of large training data is a serious issue, especially for academic recognition systems. In this paper, we propose pattern generation strategies that generate shape and structural variations to improve the performance of recognition systems based on a small training set. For data generation, we employ the public databases: CROHME 2014 and 2016 of online HMEs. The first strategy employs local and global distortions to generate shape variations. The second strategy decomposes an online HME into sub-online HMEs to get more structural variations. The hybrid strategy combines both these strategies to maximize shape and structural variations. The generated online HMEs are converted to images for offline HME recognition. We tested our strategies in an end-to-end recognition system constructed from a recent deep learning model: Convolutional Neural Network and attention-based encoder-decoder. The results of experiments on the CROHME 2014 and 2016 databases demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our strategies: our hybrid strategy achieved classification rates of 48.78% and 45.60%, respectively, on these databases. These results are competitive compared to others reported in recent literature. Our generated datasets are openly available for research community and constitute a useful resource for the HME recognition research in future.},

@article{phan_2018_augmented_incremental_recognition_of_online_handwritten_mathematical_expressions,
	abstract = {This paper presents an augmented incremental recognition method for online handwritten mathematical expressions (MEs). If an ME is recognized after all strokes are written (batch recognition), the waiting time increases significantly when the ME becomes longer. On the other hand, the pure incremental recognition method recognizes an ME whenever a new single stroke is input. It shortens the waiting time but degrades the recognition rate due to the limited context. Thus, we propose an augmented incremental recognition method that not only maintains the advantage of the two methods but also reduces their weaknesses. The proposed method has two main features: one is to process the latest stroke, and the other is to find the erroneous segmentations and recognitions in the recent strokes and correct them. In the first process, the segmentation and the recognition by Cocke--Younger--Kasami (CYK) algorithm are only executed for the latest stroke. In the second process, all the previous segmentations are updated if they are significantly changed after the latest stroke is input, and then, all the symbols related to the updated segmentations are updated with their recognition scores. These changes are reflected in the CYK table. In addition, the waiting time is further reduced by employing multi-thread processes. Experiments on our dataset and the CROHME datasets show the effectiveness of this augmented incremental recognition method, which not only maintains recognition rate even compared with the batch recognition method but also reduces the waiting time to a very small level.},

@article{onan_2017_hybrid_supervised_clustering_based_ensemble_scheme_for_text_classification,
	abstract = {Purpose The immense quantity of available unstructured text documents serve as one of the largest source of information. Text classification can be an essential task for many purposes in information retrieval, such as document organization, text filtering and sentiment analysis. Ensemble learning has been extensively studied to construct efficient text classification schemes with higher predictive performance and generalization ability. The purpose of this paper is to provide diversity among the classification algorithms of ensemble, which is a key issue in the ensemble design. Design/methodology/approach An ensemble scheme based on hybrid supervised clustering is presented for text classification. In the presented scheme, supervised hybrid clustering, which is based on cuckoo search algorithm and k-means, is introduced to partition the data samples of each class into clusters so that training subsets with higher diversities can be provided. Each classifier is trained on the diversified training subsets and the predictions of individual classifiers are combined by the majority voting rule. The predictive performance of the proposed classifier ensemble is compared to conventional classification algorithms (such as Na{\"\i}ve Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines and C4.5 algorithm) and ensemble learning methods (such as AdaBoost, bagging and random subspace) using 11 text benchmarks. Findings The experimental results indicate that the presented classifier ensemble outperforms the conventional classification algorithms and ensemble learning methods for text classification. Originality/value The presented ensemble scheme is the first to use supervised clustering to obtain diverse ensemble for text classification},

	abstract = {Designing systems for/with marginalized populations requires innovation and the integration of sophisticated domain knowledge with emergent technologies and trends. Researchers need to be cognizant of existing research trends when aspiring to design interventions to build on current and emergent needs. Traditional manual mechanisms for revealing developments in a field, such as systematic literature reviews (SLRs), cannot meet this challenge because they are time and effort intensive and the domain itself is dynamic and ever expanding. This compromises the efficacy of SLRs in keeping up with the growing academic literature. A number of emergent technologies and modern methods exist that could be harnessed to make it possible to monitor the field more effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we propose the use of natural language processing (NLP), an AI-powered text analysis technique that operates efficiently and requires limited human intervention. To investigate the use and usefulness of NLP for identifying research themes, we applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic modelling technique that uses a probabilistic model to find the co-occurrence patterns of terms that correspond to semantic topics. We applied it to a collection of 176 articles published in the Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D) field. We demonstrate the usefulness of the LDA method by comparing the findings of the LDA analysis to those of a manual analysis carried out by researchers. While NLP techniques may not be able to replace SLRs at this stage, we share some insights on how NLP techniques can complement SLRs to offset investigator bias and save time and effort in revealing emerging domain-related themes.},

	abstract = {Information posted by people on Twitter during crises can significantly improve crisis response towards reducing human and financial loss. Deep learning algorithms can identify related tweets to reduce information overloaded which prevents humanitarian organizations from using Twitter posts. However, they heavily rely on labeled data which is unavailable for emerging crises. And because each crisis has its own features such as location, occurring time and social media response, current models are known to suffer from generalizing to unseen disaster events when pretrained on past ones. To solve this problem, we propose a domain adaptation approach that makes use of a distant supervision-based framework to label the unlabeled data from emerging crises. Then, pseudo-labeled target data, along with labeled-data from similar past disasters, are used to build the target model. Our results show that our approach can be seen as a general robust method to classify unseen tweets from current events.},

However, hand-labeled training data is expensive to produce, in low coverage of event types, and limited in size, which makes supervised methods hard to extract large scale of events for knowledge base population. To solve the data labeling problem, we propose to automatically label training data for event extraction via world knowledge and linguistic knowledge, which can detect key arguments and trigger words for each event type and employ them to label events in texts automatically. The experimental results show that the quality of our large scale automatically labeled data is competitive with elaborately human-labeled data. And our automatically labeled data can incorporate with human-labeled data, then improve the performance of models learned from these data.},

A search for pre-existing annotated corpora in Brazilian Portuguese was applied, founding six corpora of which one has been selected as the training dataset. A set of tweets was collected in a specific area of Recife (Pernambuco-Brazil) using some keywords related to kinds of crimes and reinforcing some places in that area. Preprocessing tasks were applied over the pre-existing corpus and the tweets' set collected. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was applied for topic modeling followed by Multinomial Na{\"\i}ve Bayes, Linear Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression for the sentiment polarity classification. The results of the cross-validation of the experiment indicated Linear Support Vector Machines as the most accurate classification method among the three considering the specific training set used, and by this method, the new annotated corpus about the selected topic related to public security was created.},

@article{madichetty_2020_classifying_informative_and_non_informative_tweets_from_the_twitter_by_adapting_image_features_during_disaster,
	abstract = {During the crisis, people post a large number of informative and non-informative tweets on Twitter. Informative tweets provide helpful information such as affected individuals, infrastructure damage, availability and resource requirements, etc. In contrast, non-informative tweets do not provide helpful information related to either humanitarian organizations or victims. Identifying informative tweets is a challenging task during the disaster. People often post images along with text on Twitter during the disaster. In addition to tweet text features, image features are also crucial for identifying informative tweets. However, existing methods use only text features but do not use image features to identify crisis-related tweets during the disaster. This paper proposes a novel approach by considering the image features along with the text features. It includes a text-based classification model, an image-based classification model and a late fusion. The text-based classification model uses the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). CNN is used to extract text features from a tweet and the ANN is used to classify tweets based on extracted text features of CNN. The image-based classification model uses the fine-tuned VGG-16 architecture to extract the image features from the image and classify the image in a tweet. The output of the text-based classification model and the image-based classification model are combined using the late fusion technique to predict the tweet label. Extensive experiments are carried out on Twitter datasets of various crises, such as the Mexico earthquake, California Wildfires, etc., to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various parameters to identify informative tweets during the disaster.},

@article{chauhan_2017_prediction_of_places_of_visit_using_tweets,
	abstract = {We study the problem of predicting likely places of visit of users using their past tweets. What people write on their microblogs reflects their intent and desire relating to most of their common day interests. Taking this as a strong evidence, we hypothesize that tweets of the person can also be treated as source of strong indicator signals for predicting their places of visits. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for predicting place of visit within a given geospatial range considering the past tweets and the time of visit. These predictions can be used for generating places recommendation or for promotions. In this approach, we analyze use of various features that can be extracted from the historical tweets---for example, personality traits estimated from the past tweets and the actual words mentioned in the tweets. We performed extensive empirical experiments involving, real data derived from twitter timelines of 4600 persons with multi-label classification as predictive model. The performances of proposed approach outperform the four baselines with accuracy reaching 90 {\%} for top five predictions. Based on our experimental study, we come up with general guidelines on building the prediction model in terms of the type of features extracted from historical tweets, window size of historical tweets and on the optimal radius of query around the place of visit at a given time.},

@article{chen_2020_a_dirichlet_process_biterm_based_mixture_model_for_short_text_stream_clustering,
	abstract = {Short text stream clustering has become an important problem for mining textual data in diverse social media platforms (e.g., Twitter). However, most of the existing clustering methods (e.g., LDA and PLSA) are developed based on the assumption of a static corpus of long texts, while little attention has been given to short text streams. Different from the long texts, the clustering of short texts is more challenging since their word co-occurrence pattern easily suffers from a sparsity problem. In this paper, we propose a Dirichlet process biterm-based mixture model (DP-BMM), which can deal with the topic drift problem and the sparsity problem in short text stream clustering. The major advantages of DP-BMM include (1) DP-BMM explicitly exploits the word-pairs constructed from each document to enhance the word co-occurrence pattern in short texts; (2) DP-BMM can deal with the topic drift problem of short text streams naturally. Moreover, we further propose an improved algorithm of DP-BMM with forgetting property called DP-BMM-FP, which can efficiently delete biterms of outdated documents by deleting clusters of outdated batches. To perform inference, we adopt an online Gibbs sampling method for parameter estimation. Our extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that DP-BMM and DP-BMM-FP can achieve a better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of NMI metrics.},

@article{he_2020_targeted_aspects_oriented_topic_modeling_for_short_texts,
	abstract = {Topic modeling has demonstrated its value in short text topic discovery. For this task, a common way adopted by many topic models is to perform a full analysis to find all the possible topics. However, these topic models overlook the importance of deeper topics, leading to confusing topics discovered. In practice, people always tend to find more focused topics on some special aspects (or events), rather than a set of coarse topics. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method, Targeted Aspects Oriented Topic Modeling (TATM), to discover more focused topics on specific aspects in short texts. Specifically, each short text is assigned to only one targeted aspect derived from an enhanced Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture process (E-DMM). This process helps group similar words as many as possible, which achieves topic homogeneity. In addition, TATM discovers the topics for each targeted aspect from as many angles as possible by performing target-level modeling, which achieves topic completeness. Thus, TATM can make a balance between the two conflicting properties without employing any additional information or pre-trained knowledge. The extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can effectively discover more focused and complete topics, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

In doing so, a direction vector is introduced for each word, whose embedding is thus learned by not only word co-occurrence patterns in its context, but also the directions of its contextual words. Theoretical and empirical studies on complexity illustrate that our model can be trained as efficient as the original skip-gram model, when compared to other extensions of the skip-gram model. Experimental results show that our model outperforms others on different datasets in semantic (word similarity measurement) and syntactic (part-of-speech tagging) evaluations, respectively.},

@inproceedings{kumar_2018_identifying_singleton_spammers_via_spammer_group_detection,
	abstract = {Opinion spam is a well-recognized threat to the credibility of online reviews. Existing approaches to detecting spam reviews or spammers examine review content, reviewer behavior and reviewer-product network, and often operate on the assumption that spammers write at least several if not many fake reviews. On the other hand, spammers setup multiple sockpuppet IDs and write one-time, singleton spam reviews to avoid detection. It is reported that for most review sites, a large portion, sometimes over 90{\%}, of reviewers are singletons (identified by the reviewer ID). Singleton spammers are difficult to catch due to the scarcity of behavioral clues. In this paper, we argue that the key to detect singleton spammers (and their fake reviews) is to detect group spam attacks by inferring the hidden collusiveness among them. To address the challenge of lack of explicit behavioral signals for singleton reviewers, we propose to infer the hidden reviewer-product associations by completing the review-product matrix by leveraging the product and review metadata and text. Experiments on three real-life Yelp datasets established that our approach can effectively detect singleton spammers via group detection, which are often missed by existing approaches.},

Inspired by the concept of user schema in social psychology, we take a new perspective to perform user representation learning by constructing a shared latent space to capture the dependency among different modalities of user-generated data. Both users and topics are embedded to the same space to encode users' social connections and text content, to facilitate joint modeling of different modalities, via a probabilistic generative framework. We evaluated the proposed solution on large collections of Yelp reviews and StackOverflow discussion posts, with their associated network structures. The proposed model outperformed several state-of-the-art topic modeling based user models with better predictive power in unseen documents, and state-of-the-art network embedding based user models with improved link prediction quality in unseen nodes. The learnt user representations are also proved to be useful in content recommendation, e.g., expert finding in StackOverflow.},

	abstract = {Automatic text classification using machine learning is significantly affected by the text representation model. The structural information in text is necessary for natural language understanding, which is usually ignored in vector-based representations. In this paper, we present a graph kernel-based text classification framework which utilises the structural information in text effectively through the weighting and enrichment of a graph-based representation. We introduce weighted co-occurrence graphs to represent text documents, which weight the terms and their dependencies based on their relevance to text classification. We propose a novel method to automatically enrich the weighted graphs using semantic knowledge in the form of a word similarity matrix. The similarity between enriched graphs, knowledge-driven graph similarity, is calculated using a graph kernel. The semantic knowledge in the enriched graphs ensures that the graph kernel goes beyond exact matching of terms and patterns to compute the semantic similarity of documents. In the experiments on sentiment classification and topic classification tasks, our knowledge-driven similarity measure significantly outperforms the baseline text similarity measures on five benchmark text classification datasets.},

@inproceedings{gao_2018_large_scale_learnable_graph_convolutional_networks,
	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success on grid-like data such as images, but face tremendous challenges in learning from more generic data such as graphs. In CNNs, the trainable local filters enable the automatic extraction of high-level features. The computation with filters requires a fixed number of ordered units in the receptive fields. However, the number of neighboring units is neither fixed nor are they ordered in generic graphs, thereby hindering the applications of convolutional operations. Here, we address these challenges by proposing the learnable graph convolutional layer (LGCL). LGCL automatically selects a fixed number of neighboring nodes for each feature based on value ranking in order to transform graph data into grid-like structures in 1-D format, thereby enabling the use of regular convolutional operations on generic graphs. To enable model training on large-scale graphs, we propose a sub-graph training method to reduce the excessive memory and computational resource requirements suffered by prior methods on graph convolutions. Our experimental results on node classification tasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that our methods can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network datasets. Our results also indicate that the proposed methods using sub-graph training strategy are more efficient as compared to prior approaches.},

@inproceedings{long_2020_graph_structural_topic_neural_network,
	abstract = {Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) achieved tremendous success by effectively gathering local features for nodes. However, commonly do GCNs focus more on node features but less on graph structures within the neighborhood, especially higher-order structural patterns. However, such local structural patterns are shown to be indicative of node properties in numerous fields. In addition, it is not just single patterns, but the distribution over all these patterns matter, because networks are complex and the neighborhood of each node consists of a mixture of various nodes and structural patterns. Correspondingly, in this paper, we propose Graph Structural topic Neural Network, abbreviated GraphSTONE 1, a GCN model that utilizes topic models of graphs, such that the structural topics capture indicative graph structures broadly from a probabilistic aspect rather than merely a few structures. Specifically, we build topic models upon graphs using anonymous walks and Graph Anchor LDA, an LDA variant that selects significant structural patterns first, so as to alleviate the complexity and generate structural topics efficiently. In addition, we design multi-view GCNs to unify node features and structural topic features and utilize structural topics to guide the aggregation. We evaluate our model through both quantitative and qualitative experiments, where our model exhibits promising performance, high efficiency, and clear interpretability.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical multi-label text classification (HMTC) aims to tag each document with a set of classes from a taxonomic class hierarchy. Most existing HMTC methods train classifiers using massive human-labeled documents, which are often too costly to obtain in real-world applications. In this paper, we explore to conduct HMTC based on only class surface names as supervision signals. We observe that to perform HMTC, human experts typically first pinpoint a few most essential classes for the document as its {``}core classes{''}, and then check core classes{'} ancestor classes to ensure the coverage. To mimic human experts, we propose a novel HMTC framework, named TaxoClass. Specifically, TaxoClass (1) calculates document-class similarities using a textual entailment model, (2) identifies a document{'}s core classes and utilizes confident core classes to train a taxonomy-enhanced classifier, and (3) generalizes the classifier via multi-label self-training. Our experiments on two challenging datasets show TaxoClass can achieve around 0.71 Example-F1 using only class names, outperforming the best previous method by 25{\%}.},

@article{mubin_2018_an_assessment_into_the_characteristics_of_award_winning_papers_at_chi,
	abstract = {The overall readability of CHI publications is not known. In addition, little is understood about what lexical or demographic characteristics are unique to award winning papers at CHI and if they are significantly different from non award winning papers. We therefore carry out an exploration and assessment into the readability metrics as well as a meta analysis of 382 full papers and 54 notes from the 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 editions at CHI. Our results illustrate that notes did not have any significant trends whatsoever. On the other hand, award winning full papers were shown to have lower readability as compared to non award winning full papers. The type of research contribution played an important role; such that award winning full papers were significantly more likely to have a theoretical contribution as compared to non award winning full papers and full papers that presented an artifact as their contribution were more readable than other full papers. Our demographic analysis of authors indicated that the experience of authors nor their region of affiliation were not associated with the likelihood of their full paper being awarded. The experience of authors did not effect the overall readability of full papers however the region of affiliation did have a significant influence on the overall readability of full papers. In conclusion, we speculate on our obtained results through linkages with prior work in readability analysis.},

@article{thomas_2018_gradient_boosting_for_distributional_regression_faster_tuning_and_improved_variable_selection_via_noncyclical_updates,
	abstract = {We present a new algorithm for boosting generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) that allows to incorporate stability selection, an increasingly popular way to obtain stable sets of covariates while controlling the per-family error rate. The model is fitted repeatedly to subsampled data, and variables with high selection frequencies are extracted. To apply stability selection to boosted GAMLSS, we develop a new ``noncyclical''fitting algorithm that incorporates an additional selection step of the best-fitting distribution parameter in each iteration. This new algorithm has the additional advantage that optimizing the tuning parameters of boosting is reduced from a multi-dimensional to a one-dimensional problem with vastly decreased complexity. The performance of the novel algorithm is evaluated in an extensive simulation study. We apply this new algorithm to a study to estimate abundance of common eider in Massachusetts, USA, featuring excess zeros, overdispersion, nonlinearity and spatiotemporal structures. Eider abundance is estimated via boosted GAMLSS, allowing both mean and overdispersion to be regressed on covariates. Stability selection is used to obtain a sparse set of stable predictors.},

We first provide a framework of how to describe and distinguish approaches to topic extraction from bibliographic data of scientific publications. We then compare solutions delivered by the different topic extraction approaches in this special issue, and explore where they agree and differ. This is achieved without reference to a ground truth, since we have to assume the existence of multiple, equally important, valid perspectives and want to avoid bias through the adoption of an ad-hoc yardstick. Instead, we apply different ways to quantitatively and visually compare solutions to explore their commonalities and differences and develop hypotheses about the origin of these differences. We conclude with a discussion of future work needed to develop methods for comparison and validation of topic extraction results, and express our concern about the lack of access to non-proprietary benchmark data sets to support method development in the field of scientometrics.},

In this research note we use bibliometrics and topic modelling to display trends in the geographic foci and research topics mentioned in the abstracts of CF-related research papers published between 1990 and 2017. We find that studies of CF in South Asia make up a substantial proportion of the literature, although CF research in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America has also developed. Using a structural topic model, we identify four major research areas and 20 topics latent in the text of the abstracts analyzed. The trends of topic proportions over time offer evidence of a shift in research focus from broad policy analysis to local outcomes and growing interest in carbon sequestration. Results identify the most prominent CF research topics and demonstrate the potential of topic models to analyze large amounts of scientific literature.},

Here, we analyze the publication records of individual scientists, aiming to quantify their topic switching dynamics and its influence. We find that the co-citing network of papers of a scientist exhibits a clear community structure where each major community represents a research topic. Our analysis suggests that scientists have a narrow distribution of number of topics. However, researchers nowadays switch more frequently between topics than those in the early days. We also find that high switching probability in early career is associated with low overall productivity, yet with high overall productivity in latter career. Interestingly, the average citation per paper, however, is in all career stages negatively correlated with the switching probability. We propose a model that can explain the main observed features.},

	abstract = {Children and young people constitute a core target group for health literacy research and practice: during childhood and youth, fundamental cognitive, physical and emotional development processes take place and health-related behaviours and skills develop. However, there is limited knowledge and academic consensus regarding the abilities and knowledge a child or young person should possess for making sound health decisions. The research presented in this review addresses this gap by providing an overview and synthesis of current understandings of health literacy in childhood and youth. Furthermore, the authors aim to understand to what extent available models capture the unique needs and characteristics of children and young people.},

@article{hu_2018_measuring_the_interdisciplinarity_of_big_data_research_a_longitudinal_study,
	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to measure the degree of interdisciplinary collaboration in Big Data research based on the co-occurrences of subject categories using Stirling's diversity index and specialization index. Design/methodology/approach Interdisciplinarity was measured utilizing the descriptive statistics of disciplines, network indicators showing relationships between disciplines and within individual disciplines, interdisciplinary communities, Stirling's diversity index and specialization index, and a strategic diagram revealing the development status and trends of discipline communities. Findings Comprehensively considering all results, the degree of interdisciplinarity of Big Data research is increasing over time, particularly, after 2013. There is a high level of interdisciplinarity in Big Data research involving a large number of disciplines, but it is unbalanced in distribution. The interdisciplinary collaborations are not intensive on the whole; most disciplines are aggregated into a few distinct communities with computer science, business and economics, mathematics, and biotechnology and applied microbiology as the core. Four major discipline communities in Big Data research represent different directions with different development statuses and trends. Community 1, with computer science as the core, is the most mature and central to the whole interdisciplinary network. Accounting for all network indicators, computer science, engineering, business and economics, social sciences, and mathematics are the most important disciplines in Big Data research. Originality/value This study deepens our understanding of the degree and trend of interdisciplinary collaboration in Big Data research through a longitudinal study and quantitative measures based on two indexes. It has practical implications to study and reveal the interdisciplinary phenomenon and characteristics of related developments of a specific research area, or to conduct comparative studies between different research areas.},

@article{leydesdorff_2018_betweenness_and_diversity_in_journal_citation_networks_as_measures_of_interdisciplinarity___a_tribute_to_eugene_garfield,
	abstract = {Journals were central to Eugene Garfield's research interests. Among other things, journals are considered as units of analysis for bibliographic databases such as the Web of Science and Scopus. In addition to providing a basis for disciplinary classifications of journals, journal citation patterns span networks across boundaries to variable extents. Using betweenness centrality (BC) and diversity, we elaborate on the question of how to distinguish and rank journals in terms of interdisciplinarity. Interdisciplinarity, however, is difficult to operationalize in the absence of an operational definition of disciplines; the diversity of a unit of analysis is sample-dependent. BC can be considered as a measure of multi-disciplinarity. Diversity of co-citation in a citing document has been considered as an indicator of knowledge integration, but an author can also generate trans-disciplinary---that is, non-disciplined---variation by citing sources from other disciplines. Diversity in the bibliographic coupling among citing documents can analogously be considered as diffusion  or differentiation of knowledge across disciplines. Because the citation networks in the cited direction reflect both structure and variation, diversity in this direction is perhaps the best available measure of interdisciplinarity at the journal level. Furthermore, diversity is based on a summation and can therefore be decomposed; differences among (sub)sets can be tested for statistical significance. In the appendix, a general-purpose routine for measuring diversity in networks is provided.},

We look at variants of the model in which directed edges are added to the new vertex in one of two ways: using cumulative advantage (preferential attachment) choosing vertices in proportion to their degree, or with random attachment in which vertices are chosen uniformly at random. In such networks, the longest path is well defined and in some cases is known to be a better approximation to geodesics than the shortest path. We define a reverse greedy path and show both analytically and numerically that this scales with the logarithm of the size of the network with a coefficient given by the number of edges added using random attachment. This is a lower bound on the length of the longest path to any given vertex and we show numerically that the longest path also scales with the logarithm of the size of the network but with a larger coefficient that has some weak dependence on the parameters of the model.},

This paper adopts a quantitative method, the main path analysis, to comprehensively and systematically investigate the development trajectories of blockchain. Four different main paths, the global main path, the forward local main path, the backward local main path and the key-route main path are conducted simultaneously. By analyzing these various paths, on the one hand, this paper finds that papers on paths focus on two aspects, cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based applications. On the other hand, this paper discovers several major research areas of blockchain, including internet of things (IoT), healthcare, energy industry, voting, insurance and supply chain management. At the same time, this paper further analyzes the research hotspots, as well as the development trajectories of blockchain in the areas of IoT, healthcare and supply chain management by using the key-route main path analysis. This paper is conductive for both the new and experienced researchers to identify some influential papers and grasp the knowledge diffusion paths in these domains.},

@article{lathabai_2018_an_integrated_approach_to_path_analysis_for_weighted_citation_networks,
	abstract = {Profuse growth of scientometrics as a research field owes a discernible attribution to the introduction of citation networks and other scientograms. Centrality analysis, path analysis and cluster analysis are three major network analysis tools. Hummon and Doreian's introduction of path retrieval methods based on (1) traversal count as weight assignment (for arcs) method and (2) search methods such as local (forward) search and global search, marked the commencement of path analysis. Original Hummon--Doreian traversal count based weight assignment methods such as Search Path Link Count and Search Path Node Pair were computationally complex. Along with the computational improvement of these weights, Batagelj added another computationally efficient traversal count method to the path analysis literature known as Search Path Count. A major development in search methods was seen recently with the introduction of innovative search methods such as backward (local) search and key-route (local and global) search by Liu and Lu. They also powered the available and new local search methods with a parameter to control the search. Major advantage of Liu--Lu methods lies in the fact that these can reveal more paths or more papers that are usually missed out in classical methods. All these contributions considered unweighted citation networks as the object of analysis. Despite being a tool of tremendous potential, path analysis is much underexplored relative to other network analysis tools. Inspired by these, we generalise Liu--Lu integrated approach, the present state-of-art in path analysis to an integrated approach for weighted networks. We demonstrate a manifold improvement in analysis opportunities with the generalized integrated approach using FV gradient weights for weight assignment, on a case study of the field `IT for engineering'. Integrated approach for weighted networks do not need additional implementation effort in PAJEK and this will be beneficial for a multitude of analysts and decision makers.},

As compared to the MSDF methods in the sensor and other fields, and considering the features of scientometrics, in this paper an application model and procedure of MSDF in scientometrics are proposed. The model and procedure can be divided into three parts: data type integration, fusion of data relations, and ensemble clustering. Furthermore, the fusion of data relations can be divided into cross-integration of multi-mode data and matrix fusion of multi-relational data. To obtain a clearer and deeper analysis of the MSDF model, this paper further focuses on the application of MSDF in topic identification based on text analysis of scientific literatures. This paper also discusses the application of MSDF for the exploration of scientific literatures. Finally, the most suitable MSDF methods for different situations are discussed.},

Bibliometrics has responded by developing a strong and growing structural bibliometrics, which is concerned with delineating fields and identifying thematic structures. In the course of these developments, a concern emerged and is steadily growing. Do the sets of publications, authors or institutions we identify and visualise with our methods indeed represent thematic structures? To what extent are results of topic identification exercises determined by properties of knowledge structures, and to what extent are they determined by the approaches we use? Do we produce more than artefacts? These questions triggered the collective process of comparative topic identification reported in this special issue. The introduction traces the history of bibliometric approaches to topic identification, identifies the major challenges involved in these exercises, and introduces the contributions to the special issue.},

Our previous scientometric review of IS provided a snapshot of this fast-growing field up to the end of 2008. This new study aims to identify emerging trends and new developments appearing in the subsequent 7574 articles published in 10 IS journals between 2009 and 2016, including 20,960 references. The results of a document co-citation analysis show great changes in the research topics in the IS domain. The positions of certain core topics found in the previous study, namely, information retrieval, webometrics, and citation behavior, have been replaced by scientometric indicators (H-index), citation analysis (citation performance and bibliometrics), scientific collaboration, and information behavior in the most recent period of 2009--2016. Dual-map overlays of journals show that the knowledge base of IS research has shifted considerably since 2010, with emerging topics including scientific evaluation indicators, altmetrics, science mapping and visualization, bibliometrics, citation analysis, and scientific collaboration.},

Besides being a important for the advancement of AI, emotion processing is also important for the closely related task of polarity detection. The opportunity automatically to capture the sentiments of the general public about social events, political movements, marketing campaigns, and product preferences, in fact, has raised increasing interest both in the scientific community, for the exciting open challenges, and in the business world, for the remarkable fallouts in marketing and financial market prediction. This has led to the emerging fields of affective computing and sentiment analysis, which leverage on human-computer interaction, information retrieval, and multimodal signal processing for distilling people's sentiments from the ever-growing amount of online social data.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study an important yet largely under-explored setting of graph embedding, i.e., embedding communities instead of each individual nodes. We find that community embedding is not only useful for community-level applications such as graph visualization, but also beneficial to both community detection and node classification. To learn such embedding, our insight hinges upon a closed loop among community embedding, community detection and node embedding. On the one hand, node embedding can help improve community detection, which outputs good communities for fitting better community embedding. On the other hand, community embedding can be used to optimize the node embedding by introducing a community-aware high-order proximity. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel community embedding framework that jointly solves the three tasks together. We evaluate such a framework on multiple real-world datasets, and show that it improves graph visualization and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various application tasks, e.g., community detection and node classification.},

According to recent social statistics, we have more than 930 million people are using WhatsApp with more than 340 million active daily users and 955 million people who access Facebook daily with an average daily photo uploads up to 325 million. The approach presented in this paper employs the collaborative tagging accumulated by huge number of users to improve social media recommendation. Our approach has two phases, in the first phase, we compute the tag-item weight model and in the second phase, we compute the user-tag preference model. After that we employ the two models to find the suitable items tailored to the user's preferences and recommend the items with the highest score. Also our model can compute the tag score and suggest the tags with the highest weight to the user according to their preferences. The experiment results performed on Flicker and MovieLens prove that our approach is capable to improve the social media recommendation.},

	abstract = {Many real applications in real-time news stream advertising call for efficient processing of long queries against short text. In such applications, dynamic news feeds are regarded as queries to match against an advertisement (ad) database for retrieving the k most relevant ads. The existing approaches to keyword retrieval cannot work well in this search scenario when queries are triggered at a very high frequency. To address the problem, we introduce new techniques to significantly improve search performance. First, we devise a two-level partitioning for tight upper bound estimation and a lazy evaluation scheme to delay full evaluation of unpromising candidates, which can bring three to four times performance boosting in a database with 7 million ads. Second, we propose a novel rank-aware block-oriented inverted index to further improve performance. In this index scheme, each entry in an inverted list is assigned a rank according to its importance in the ad. Then, we introduce a block-at-a-time search strategy based on the index scheme to support a much tighter upper bound estimation and a very early termination. We have conducted experiments with real datasets, and the results show that the rank-aware method can further improve performance by an order of magnitude.},

	abstractnote = {Topic models have been widely applied in discovering topics that underly a collection of documents. Incorporating human knowledge can guide conventional topic models to produce topics which are easily interpreted and semantically coherent. Several knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, but these models just leverage lexical knowledge of words that are often not in accordance with topics. To solve the problem, we recognize entity mentions, besides words, in the documents and incorporate entity knowledge from external knowledge bases. In this paper, we study to utilize entity knowledge, concepts and categories in Wikipedia, as prior knowledge into topic models to discover more coherent topics. A novel knowledge-based topic model, WCM-LDA (Wikipedia-Category-concept-Mention Latent Dirichlet Allocation), is proposed, which not only models the relationship between words and topics, but also utilizes concept and category knowledge of entities to model the semantic relation of entities and topics. We compare WCM-LDA with the state-of-the-art knowledge-based topic models, on three datasets. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing baseline methods on all three datasets. Moreover, our model can visualize topics with top words, concepts and categories such that topics are made easily to be interpreted and classified.},

@inproceedings{khani_2018_context_aware_trustworthy_service_evaluation_in_social_internet_of_things,
	abstract = {In Social Internet of Things (SIoT) environments, a large number of users and Internet of Things (IoT) based devices are connected to each other, so that they can share SIoT-based services. IoT-based devices establish social relations with each other according to the social relations of their owners in Online Social Networks (OSNs). In such an environment, a big challenge is how to provide trustworthy service evaluation. Currently, the prevalent trust management mechanisms consider QoS-based trust and social-relation based trust mechanisms in evaluating the trustworthiness of service providers. However, the existing trust management mechanisms in SIoT environments do not consider the different contexts of trust. Therefore, dishonest SIoT devices, based on their owners' social relations, can succeed in advertising low-quality services or exploiting maliciously provided services. In this paper, we first propose three contexts of trust in SIoT environments including the status and environment (time and location) of devices, and the types of tasks. Then, we propose a novel Mutual Context-aware Trustworthy Service Evaluation (MCTSE) model. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed contextual trust evaluation model can effectively differentiate honest and dishonest devices and provide a high success rate in selecting the most trustworthy services and providing high resilience against different attacks from dishonest devices.},

	abstract = {Determining appropriate statistical distributions for modeling text corpora is important for accurate estimation of numerical characteristics. Based on the validity of the test on a claim that the data conforms to Poisson distribution we propose Poisson decomposition model (PDM), a statistical model for modeling count data of text corpora, which can straightly capture each document's multidimensional numerical characteristics on topics. In PDM, each topic is represented as a parameter vector with multidimensional Poisson distribution, which can be easily normalized to multinomial term probabilities and each document is represented as measurements on topics and thereby reduced to a measurement vector on topics. We use gradient descent methods and sampling algorithm for parameter estimation. We carry out extensive experiments on the topics produced by our models. The results demonstrate our approach can extract more coherent topics and is competitive in document clustering by using the PDM-based features, compared to PLSI and LDA.},

	abstract = {Aspect extraction is an important and challenging task in aspect-based sentiment analysis. Existing works tend to apply variants of topic models on this task. While fairly successful, these methods usually do not produce highly coherent aspects. In this paper, we present a novel neural approach with the aim of discovering coherent aspects. The model improves coherence by exploiting the distribution of word co-occurrences through the use of neural word embeddings. Unlike topic models which typically assume independently generated words, word embedding models encourage words that appear in similar contexts to be located close to each other in the embedding space. In addition, we use an attention mechanism to de-emphasize irrelevant words during training, further improving the coherence of aspects. Experimental results on real-life datasets demonstrate that our approach discovers more meaningful and coherent aspects, and substantially outperforms baseline methods on several evaluation tasks.},

@inproceedings{he_2018_effective_attention_modeling_for_aspect_level_sentiment_classification,
	abstract = {Aspect-level sentiment classification aims to determine the sentiment polarity of a review sentence towards an opinion target. A sentence could contain multiple sentiment-target pairs; thus the main challenge of this task is to separate different opinion contexts for different targets. To this end, attention mechanism has played an important role in previous state-of-the-art neural models. The mechanism is able to capture the importance of each context word towards a target by modeling their semantic associations. We build upon this line of research and propose two novel approaches for improving the effectiveness of attention. First, we propose a method for target representation that better captures the semantic meaning of the opinion target. Second, we introduce an attention model that incorporates syntactic information into the attention mechanism. We experiment on attention-based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models using the datasets from SemEval 2014, 2015, and 2016. The experimental results show that the conventional attention-based LSTM can be substantially improved by incorporating the two approaches.},

@inproceedings{wang_2020_neural_topic_modeling_with_bidirectional_adversarial_training,
	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a surge of interests of using neural topic models for automatic topic extraction from text, since they avoid the complicated mathematical derivations for model inference as in traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). However, these models either typically assume improper prior (e.g. Gaussian or Logistic Normal) over latent topic space or could not infer topic distribution for a given document. To address these limitations, we propose a neural topic modeling approach, called Bidirectional Adversarial Topic (BAT) model, which represents the first attempt of applying bidirectional adversarial training for neural topic modeling. The proposed BAT builds a two-way projection between the document-topic distribution and the document-word distribution. It uses a generator to capture the semantic patterns from texts and an encoder for topic inference. Furthermore, to incorporate word relatedness information, the Bidirectional Adversarial Topic model with Gaussian (Gaussian-BAT) is extended from BAT. To verify the effectiveness of BAT and Gaussian-BAT, three benchmark corpora are used in our experiments. The experimental results show that BAT and Gaussian-BAT obtain more coherent topics, outperforming several competitive baselines. Moreover, when performing text clustering based on the extracted topics, our models outperform all the baselines, with more significant improvements achieved by Gaussian-BAT where an increase of near 6{\%} is observed in accuracy.},

	abstract = {Label-specific topics can be widely used for supporting personality psychology, aspect-level sentiment analysis, and cross-domain sentiment classification. To generate label-specific topics, several supervised topic models which adopt likelihood-driven objective functions have been proposed. However, it is hard for them to get a precise estimation on both topic discovery and supervised learning. In this study, we propose a supervised topic model based on the Siamese network, which can trade off label-specific word distributions with document-specific label distributions in a uniform framework. Experiments on real-world datasets validate that our model performs competitive in topic discovery quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, the proposed model can effectively predict categorical or real-valued labels for new documents by generating word embeddings from a label-specific topical space.},

Unlike existing variational autoencoder based models, we directly enforce Dirichlet prior on the latent document-topic vectors. We exploit the structure of the latent space and apply a suitable kernel in minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to perform distribution matching. We discover that MMD performs much better than the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in matching high dimensional Dirichlet distribution. We further discover that incorporating randomness in the encoder output during training leads to significantly more coherent topics. To measure the diversity of the produced topics, we propose a simple topic uniqueness metric. Together with the widely used coherence measure NPMI, we offer a more wholistic evaluation of topic quality. Experiments on several real datasets show that our model produces significantly better topics than existing topic models.},

@inproceedings{guo_2017_understanding_users_budgets_for_recommendation_with_hierarchical_poisson_factorization,
	abstract = {People consume and rate products in online shopping websites. The historical purchases of customers reflect their personal consumption habits and indicate their future shopping behaviors. Traditional preference-based recommender systems try to provide recommendations by analyzing users' feedback such as ratings and clicks. But unfortunately, most of the existing recommendation algorithms ignore the budget of the users. So they cannot avoid recommending users with products that will exceed their budgets. And they also cannot understand how the users will assign their budgets to different products. In this paper, we develop a generative model named collaborative budget-aware Poisson factorization (CBPF) to connect users' ratings and budgets. The CBPF model is intuitive and highly interpretable. We compare the proposed model with several state-of-the-art budget-unaware recommendation methods on several realworld datasets. The results show the advantage of uncovering users' budgets for recommendation.},

A bag-of-words representation does not allow to grasp the semantic relationships between concepts when comparing strongly related sentences with no words in common. To overcome this issue, in this paper we propose a centroid-based method for text summarization that exploits the compositional capabilities of word embeddings. The evaluations on multi-document and multilingual datasets prove the effectiveness of the continuous vector representation of words compared to the bag-of-words model. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves good performance even in comparison to more complex deep learning models. Our method is unsupervised and it can be adopted in other summarization tasks.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic topic models are important tools for indexing, summarizing, and analyzing large document collections by their themes. However, promoting end-user understanding of topics remains an open research problem. We compare labels generated by users given four topic visualization techniques{---}word lists, word lists with bars, word clouds, and network graphs{---}against each other and against automatically generated labels. Our basis of comparison is participant ratings of how well labels describe documents from the topic. Our study has two phases: a labeling phase where participants label visualized topics and a validation phase where different participants select which labels best describe the topics{'} documents. Although all visualizations produce similar quality labels, simple visualizations such as word lists allow participants to quickly understand topics, while complex visualizations take longer but expose multi-word expressions that simpler visualizations obscure. Automatic labels lag behind user-created labels, but our dataset of manually labeled topics highlights linguistic patterns (e.g., hypernyms, phrases) that can be used to improve automatic topic labeling algorithms.},

@inproceedings{gao_2019_auto_encoding_total_correlation_explanation,
	abstract = {Advances in unsupervised learning enable reconstruction and generation of samples from complex distributions, but this success is marred by the inscrutability of the representations learned. We propose an information-theoretic approach to characterizing disentanglement and dependence in representation learning using multivariate mutual information, also called total correlation. The principle of Total Cor-relation Ex-planation (CorEx) has motivated successful unsupervised learning applications across a variety of domains but under some restrictive assumptions. Here we relax those restrictions by introducing a flexible variational lower bound to CorEx. Surprisingly, we find this lower bound is equivalent to the one in variational autoencoders (VAE) under certain conditions. This information-theoretic view of VAE deepens our understanding of hierarchical VAE and motivates a new algorithm, AnchorVAE, that makes latent codes more interpretable through information maximization and enables generation of richer and more realistic samples.},

In topic modeling so far, perplexity is a direct optimization target. However, topic coherence, owing to its challenging computation, is not optimized for and is only evaluated after training. In this work, under a neural variational inference framework, we propose methods to incorporate a topic coherence objective into the training process. We demonstrate that such a coherence-aware topic model exhibits a similar level of perplexity as baseline models but achieves substantially higher topic coherence.},

We propose a simple yet effective approach, which incorporates auxiliary multi-task and adversarial objectives, for style prediction and bag-of-words prediction, respectively. We show, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that the style and content are indeed disentangled in the latent space. This disentangled latent representation learning can be applied to style transfer on non-parallel corpora. We achieve high performance in terms of transfer accuracy, content preservation, and language fluency, in comparison to various previous approaches.},

First, we created a large-scale book review dataset that includes fine-grained spoiler annotations at the sentence-level, as well as book and (anonymized) user information. Second, we carefully analyzed this dataset, and found that: spoiler language tends to be book-specific; spoiler distributions vary greatly across books and review authors; and spoiler sentences tend to jointly appear in the latter part of reviews. Third, inspired by these findings, we developed an end-to-end neural network architecture to detect spoiler sentences in review corpora. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed method substantially outperforms existing baselines.},

	abstract = {Pre-processing is the first step in text classification, and choosing right pre-processing techniques can improve classification effectiveness. We experimentally compare 16 commonly used pre-processing techniques on two Twitter datasets for Sentiment Analysis, employing four popular machine learning algorithms, namely, Linear SVC, Bernoulli Na{\"\i}ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Convolutional Neural Networks. We evaluate the pre-processing techniques on their resulting classification accuracy and number of features they produce. We find that techniques like lemmatization, removing numbers, and replacing contractions, improve accuracy, while others like removing punctuation do not. Finally, in order to investigate interactions---desirable or otherwise---between the techniques when they are employed simultaneously in a pipeline fashion, an ablation and combination study is contacted. The results of ablation and combination show the significance of techniques such as replacing numbers and replacing repetitions of punctuation.},

@article{blair_2020_aggregated_topic_models_for_increasing_social_media_topic_coherence,
	abstract = {This research presents a novel aggregating method for constructing an aggregated topic model that is composed of the topics with greater coherence than individual models. When generating a topic model, a number of parameters have to be specified. The resulting topics can be very general or very specific, which depend on the chosen parameters. In this study we investigate the process of aggregating multiple topic models generated using different parameters with a focus on whether combining the general and specific topics is able to increase topic coherence. We employ cosine similarity and Jensen-Shannon divergence to compute the similarity among topics and combine them into an aggregated model when their similarity scores exceed a predefined threshold. The model is evaluated against the standard topics models generated by the latent Dirichlet allocation and Non-negative Matrix Factorisation. Specifically we use the coherence of topics to compare the individual models that create aggregated models against those of the aggregated model and models generated by Non-negative Matrix Factorisation, respectively. The results demonstrate that the aggregated model outperforms those topic models at a statistically significant level in terms of topic coherence over an external corpus. We also make use of the aggregated topic model on social media data to validate the method in a realistic scenario and find that again it outperforms individual topic models.},

	abstract = {To qualitative researchers, social media offers a novel opportunity to harvest a massive and diverse range of content without the need for intrusive or intensive data collection procedures. However, performing a qualitative analysis across a massive social media data set is cumbersome and impractical. Instead, researchers often extract a subset of content to analyze, but a framework to facilitate this process is currently lacking. We present a four-phased framework for improving this extraction process, which blends the capacities of data science techniques to compress large data sets into smaller spaces, with the capabilities of qualitative analysis to address research questions. We demonstrate this framework by investigating the topics of Australian Twitter commentary on climate change, using quantitative (non-negative matrix inter-joint factorization; topic alignment) and qualitative (thematic analysis) techniques. Our approach is useful for researchers seeking to perform qualitative analyses of social media, or researchers wanting to supplement their quantitative work with a qualitative analysis of broader social context and meaning.},

We compare the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of document-term matrices using the same data. Since topic models are almost by definition applied to text corpora which are too large to read, validation of the results of these models is hardly possible; furthermore the models are irreproducible for a number of reasons. However, removing a small fraction of the documents from the sample---a test for reliability---has on average a larger impact in terms of decay on LDA than on PCA-based models. The semantic coherence of LDA models outperforms PCA-based models. In our opinion, results of the topic models are statistical and should not be used for grant selections and micro decision-making about research without follow-up using domain-specific semantic maps.}},

@article{karami_2018_characterizing_diabetes_diet_exercise_and_obesity_comments_on_twitter,
	abstract = {Social media provide a platform for users to express their opinions and share information. Understanding public health opinions on social media, such as Twitter, offers a unique approach to characterizing common health issues such as diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity (DDEO); however, collecting and analyzing a large scale conversational public health data set is a challenging research task. The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of the general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity (DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8% of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity. The strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and obesity (p<.0002). Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity (p<.0005), and diet and obesity (p<.001). DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with ``Diabetes'', excluding the DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer. The non-DDEO subtopics for ``Diet'' included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities, weight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for ``Exercise'' included computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for ``Obesity'' included Alzheimer, cancer, and children. With 2.67 billion social media users in 2016, publicly available data such as Twitter posts can be utilized to support clinical providers, public health experts, and social scientists in better understanding common public opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity.},

However, as the quality of the topics induced by topic models greatly varies, much research effort has been devoted to their automated evaluation. Recent research has focused on topic coherence as a measure of a topic's quality. Existing topic coherence measures work by considering the semantic similarity of topic words. This makes them unfit to detect the coherence of transient topics with semantically unrelated topic words, which abound in news media texts. In this paper, we introduce the notion of document-based topic coherence and propose novel topic coherence measures that estimate topic coherence based on topic documents rather than topic words. We evaluate the proposed measures on two datasets containing topics manually labeled for document-based coherence, on which the proposed measures outperform a strong baseline as well as word-based coherence measures. We also demonstrate the usefulness of document-based coherence measures for automated topic discovery from news media texts.},

These systems enable users to explore collections by way of latent topics. A standard way to represent a topic is using a term list; that is the top-n words with highest conditional probability within the topic. Other topic representations such as textual and image labels also have been proposed. However, there has been no comparison of these alternative representations. In this article, we compare 3 different topic representations in a document retrieval task. Participants were asked to retrieve relevant documents based on predefined queries within a fixed time limit, presenting topics in one of the following modalities: a lists of terms, b textual phrase labels, and c image labels. Results show that textual labels are easier for users to interpret than are term lists and image labels. Moreover, the precision of retrieved documents for textual and image labels is comparable to the precision achieved by representing topics using term lists, demonstrating that labeling methods are an effective alternative topic representation.},

In this work we present an analysis of Twitter data related to the aforementioned election. We show how users self-organize into communities, and identify the themes that define those communities. Next we analyze the content generated by those communities, and the extent to which these communities interact. Despite these elections being held in Germany, we note a substantial impact from the English-speaking Twittersphere. Specifically, we note that many of these accounts appear to be from the American alt-right movement, and support the German alt-right movement.},

	abstract = {Topic modeling is an important tool in natural language processing. Topic models provide two forms of output. The first is a predictive model. This type of model has the ability to predict unseen documents (e.g., their categories). When topic models are used in this way, there are ample measures to assess their performance. The second output of these models is the topics themselves. Topics are lists of keywords that describe the top words pertaining to each topic. Often, these lists of keywords are presented to a human subject who then assesses the meaning of the topic, which is ultimately subjective. One of the fundamental problems of topic models lies in assessing the quality of the topics from the perspective of human interpretability. Naturally, human subjects need to be employed to evaluate interpretability of a topic. Lately, crowdsourcing approaches are widely used to serve the role of human subjects in evaluation. In this work we study measures of interpretability and propose to measure topic interpretability from two perspectives: topic coherence and topic consensus. We start with an existing measure for topic coherence--model precision. It evaluates coherence of a topic by introducing an intruded word and measuring how well a human subject or a crowdsourcing approach could identify the intruded word: if it is easy to identify, the topic is coherent. We then investigate how we can measure coherence comprehensively by examining dimensions of topic coherence. For the second perspective of topic interpretability, we suggest topic consensus that measures how well the results of a crowdsourcing approach matches those given categories of topics. Good topics should lead to good categories, thus, high topic consensus. Therefore, if there is low topic consensus in terms of categories, topics could be of low interpretability. We then further discuss how topic coherence and topic consensus assess different aspects of topic interpretability and hope that this work can pave way for comprehensive measures of topic interpretability.},

@article{li_2018_short_text_topic_modeling_by_exploring_original_documents,
	abstract = {Topic modeling for short texts faces a tough challenge, owing to the sparsity problem. An effective solution is to aggregate short texts into long pseudo-documents before training a standard topic model. The main concern of this solution is the way of aggregating short texts. A recent developed self-aggregation-based topic model (SATM) can adaptively aggregate short texts without using heuristic information. However, the model definition of SATM is a bit rigid, and more importantly, it tends to overfitting and time-consuming for large-scale corpora. To improve SATM, we propose a generalized topic model for short texts, namely latent topic model (LTM). In LTM, we assume that the observable short texts are snippets of normal long texts (namely original documents) generated by a given standard topic model, but their original document memberships are unknown. With Gibbs sampling, LTM drives an adaptive aggregation process of short texts, and simultaneously estimates other latent variables of interest. Additionally, we propose a mini-batch scheme for fast inference. Experimental results indicate that LTM is competitive with the state-of-the-art baseline models on short text topic modeling.},

@article{agrawal_2018_what_is_wrong_with_topic_modeling_and_how_to_fix_it_using_search_based_software_engineering,
	abstract = {Context
Topic modeling finds human-readable structures in unstructured textual data. A widely used topic modeling technique is Latent Dirichlet allocation. When running on different datasets, LDA suffers from ``order effects'', i.e., different topics are generated if the order of training data is shuffled. Such order effects introduce a systematic error for any study. This error can relate to misleading results; specifically, inaccurate topic descriptions and a reduction in the efficacy of text mining classification results.
Objective
To provide a method in which distributions generated by LDA are more stable and can be used for further analysis.
Method
We use LDADE, a search-based software engineering tool which uses Differential Evolution (DE) to tune the LDA's parameters. LDADE is evaluated on data from a programmer information exchange site (Stackoverflow), title and abstract text of thousands of Software Engineering (SE) papers, and software defect reports from NASA. Results were collected across different implementations of LDA (Python+Scikit-Learn, Scala+Spark) across Linux platform and for different kinds of LDAs (VEM, Gibbs sampling). Results were scored via topic stability and text mining classification accuracy.
Results
In all treatments: (i) standard LDA exhibits very large topic instability; (ii) LDADE's tunings dramatically reduce cluster instability; (iii) LDADE also leads to improved performances for supervised as well as unsupervised learning.
Conclusion
Due to topic instability, using standard LDA with its ``off-the-shelf'' settings should now be depreciated. Also, in future, we should require SE papers that use LDA to test and (if needed) mitigate LDA topic instability. Finally, LDADE is a candidate technology for effectively and efficiently reducing that instability.},

However, EHRs present several modeling challenges, including highly sparse data matrices, noisy irregular clinical notes, arbitrary biases in billing code assignment, diagnosis-driven lab tests, and heterogeneous data types. To address these challenges, we present MixEHR, a multi-view Bayesian topic model. We demonstrate MixEHR on MIMIC-III, Mayo Clinic Bipolar Disorder, and Quebec Congenital Heart Disease EHR datasets. Qualitatively, MixEHR disease topics reveal meaningful combinations of clinical features across heterogeneous data types. Quantitatively, we observe superior prediction accuracy of diagnostic codes and lab test imputations compared to the state-of-art methods. We leverage the inferred patient topic mixtures to classify target diseases and predict mortality of patients in critical conditions. In all comparison, MixEHR confers competitive performance and reveals meaningful disease-related topics.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Electronic health record (EHR) data provides a new venue to elucidate disease comorbidities and latent phenotypes for precision medicine. To fully exploit its potential, a realistic data generative process of the EHR data needs to be modelled.Materials and Methods: We present MixEHR-S to jointly infer specialist-disease topics from the EHR data. As the key contribution, we model the specialist assignments and ICD-coded diagnoses as the latent topics based on patient's underlying disease topic mixture in a novel unified supervised hierarchical Bayesian topic model. For efficient inference, we developed a closed-form collapsed variational inference algorithm to learn the model distributions of MixEHR-S.Results: We applied MixEHR-S to two independent large-scale EHR databases in Quebec with three targeted applications: (1) Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) diagnostic prediction among 154,775 patients; (2) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnostic prediction among 73,791 patients; (3) future insulin treatment prediction among 78,712 patients diagnosed with diabetes as a mean to assess the disease exacerbation. In all three applications, MixEHR-S conferred clinically meaningful latent topics among the most predictive latent topics and achieved superior target prediction accuracy compared to the existing methods, providing opportunities for prioritizing high-risk patients for healthcare services.Availability and implementation: MixEHR-S source code and scripts of the experiments are freely available at https://github.com/li-lab-mcgill/mixehrS},

@article{wang_2020_unsupervised_machine_learning_for_the_discovery_of_latent_disease_clusters_and_patient_subgroups_using_electronic_health_records,
	abstract = {Machine learning has become ubiquitous and a key technology on mining electronic health records (EHRs) for facilitating clinical research and practice. Unsupervised machine learning, as opposed to supervised learning, has shown promise in identifying novel patterns and relations from EHRs without using human created labels. In this paper, we investigate the application of unsupervised machine learning models in discovering latent disease clusters and patient subgroups based on EHRs. We utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model, and proposed a novel model named Poisson Dirichlet Model (PDM), which extends the LDA approach using a Poisson distribution to model patients' disease diagnoses and to alleviate age and sex factors by considering both observed and expected observations. In the empirical experiments, we evaluated LDA and PDM on three patient cohorts, namely Osteoporosis, Delirium/Dementia, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)/Bronchiectasis Cohorts, with their EHR data retrieved from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) medical records linkage system, for the discovery of latent disease clusters and patient subgroups. We compared the effectiveness of LDA and PDM in identifying disease clusters through the visualization of disease representations. We tested the performance of LDA and PDM in differentiating patient subgroups through survival analysis, as well as statistical analysis of demographics and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) scores in those subgroups. The experimental results show that the proposed PDM could effectively identify distinguished disease clusters based on the latent patterns hidden in the EHR data by alleviating the impact of age and sex, and that LDA could stratify patients into differentiable subgroups with larger p-values than PDM. However, those subgroups identified by LDA are highly associated with patients' age and sex. The subgroups discovered by PDM might imply the underlying patterns of diseases of greater interest in epidemiology research due to the alleviation of age and sex. Both unsupervised machine learning approaches could be leveraged to discover patient subgroups using EHRs but with different foci.},

@inproceedings{chang_2018_distributional_inclusion_vector_embedding_for_unsupervised_hypernymy_detection,
	abstract = {Modeling hypernymy, such as poodle is-a dog, is an important generalization aid to many NLP tasks, such as entailment, relation extraction, and question answering. Supervised learning from labeled hypernym sources, such as WordNet, limits the coverage of these models, which can be addressed by learning hypernyms from unlabeled text. Existing unsupervised methods either do not scale to large vocabularies or yield unacceptably poor accuracy. This paper introduces distributional inclusion vector embedding (DIVE), a simple-to-implement unsupervised method of hypernym discovery via per-word non-negative vector embeddings which preserve the inclusion property of word contexts. In experimental evaluations more comprehensive than any previous literature of which we are aware{---}evaluating on 11 datasets using multiple existing as well as newly proposed scoring functions{---}we find that our method provides up to double the precision of previous unsupervised methods, and the highest average performance, using a much more compact word representation, and yielding many new state-of-the-art results.},

	abstract = {We present a Few-Shot Relation Classification Dataset (dataset), consisting of 70, 000 sentences on 100 relations derived from Wikipedia and annotated by crowdworkers. The relation of each sentence is first recognized by distant supervision methods, and then filtered by crowdworkers. We adapt the most recent state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods for relation classification and conduct thorough evaluation of these methods. Empirical results show that even the most competitive few-shot learning models struggle on this task, especially as compared with humans. We also show that a range of different reasoning skills are needed to solve our task. These results indicate that few-shot relation classification remains an open problem and still requires further research. Our detailed analysis points multiple directions for future research.},

@inproceedings{breitfeller_2019_finding_microaggressions_in_the_wild_a_case_for_locating_elusive_phenomena_in_social_media_posts,
	abstract = {Microaggressions are subtle, often veiled, manifestations of human biases. These uncivil interactions can have a powerful negative impact on people by marginalizing minorities and disadvantaged groups. The linguistic subtlety of microaggressions in communication has made it difficult for researchers to analyze their exact nature, and to quantify and extract microaggressions automatically. Specifically, the lack of a corpus of real-world microaggressions and objective criteria for annotating them have prevented researchers from addressing these problems at scale. In this paper, we devise a general but nuanced, computationally operationalizable typology of microaggressions based on a small subset of data that we have. We then create two datasets: one with examples of diverse types of microaggressions recollected by their targets, and another with gender-based microaggressions in public conversations on social media. We introduce a new, more objective, criterion for annotation and an active-learning based procedure that increases the likelihood of surfacing posts containing microaggressions. Finally, we analyze the trends that emerge from these new datasets.},

	abstract = {Norms help people navigate their social lives, dictating what behaviors are typical, expected, or valued in a given context. Here we suggest that a subtle linguistic cue---the generic usage of the word ``you'' (i.e., ``you'' that refers to people in general rather than to one or more specific individuals) carries persuasive force, influencing how people discern unfamiliar norms. Across five experiments (N = 800), people endorsed unfamiliar behaviors described with generic-you (e.g., ``You share them with your friends'') as more normatively correct than behaviors expressed with `I' (e.g., ``I share them with my family'') or third-person singular pronouns (``he'' or ``she''; e.g., ``She shares them with her family''). These effects persisted even when participants were told that their informants were highly knowledgeable about the norms. Together, these findings indicate that generic-you functions as a linguistic nudge that carries persuasive force. Broadly, they add to a growing body of literature on how subtle linguistic shifts can meaningfully influence social cognition.},

@inproceedings{toshniwal_2020_a_cross_task_analysis_of_text_span_representations,
	abstract = {Many natural language processing (NLP) tasks involve reasoning with textual spans, including question answering, entity recognition, and coreference resolution. While extensive research has focused on functional architectures for representing words and sentences, there is less work on representing arbitrary spans of text within sentences. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of six span representation methods using eight pretrained language representation models across six tasks, including two tasks that we introduce. We find that, although some simple span representations are fairly reliable across tasks, in general the optimal span representation varies by task, and can also vary within different facets of individual tasks. We also find that the choice of span representation has a bigger impact with a fixed pretrained encoder than with a fine-tuned encoder.},

@inproceedings{asaadi_2019_big_bird_a_large_fine_grained_bigram_relatedness_dataset_for_examining_semantic_composition,
	abstract = {Bigrams (two-word sequences) hold a special place in semantic composition research since they are the smallest unit formed by composing words. A semantic relatedness dataset that includes bigrams will thus be useful in the development of automatic methods of semantic composition. However, existing relatedness datasets only include pairs of unigrams (single words). Further, existing datasets were created using rating scales and thus suffer from limitations such as in consistent annotations and scale region bias. In this paper, we describe how we created a large, fine-grained, bigram relatedness dataset (BiRD), using a comparative annotation technique called Best{--}Worst Scaling. Each of BiRD{'}s 3,345 English term pairs involves at least one bigram. We show that the relatedness scores obtained are highly reliable (split-half reliability r= 0.937). We analyze the data to obtain insights into bigram semantic relatedness. Finally, we present benchmark experiments on using the relatedness dataset as a testbed to evaluate simple unsupervised measures of semantic composition. BiRD is made freely available to foster further research on how meaning can be represented and how meaning can be composed.},

@inproceedings{bommasani_2020_interpreting_pretrained_contextualized_representations_via_reductions_to_static_embeddings,
	abstract = {Contextualized representations (e.g. ELMo, BERT) have become the default pretrained representations for downstream NLP applications. In some settings, this transition has rendered their static embedding predecessors (e.g. Word2Vec, GloVe) obsolete. As a side-effect, we observe that older interpretability methods for static embeddings {---} while more diverse and mature than those available for their dynamic counterparts {---} are underutilized in studying newer contextualized representations. Consequently, we introduce simple and fully general methods for converting from contextualized representations to static lookup-table embeddings which we apply to 5 popular pretrained models and 9 sets of pretrained weights. Our analysis of the resulting static embeddings notably reveals that pooling over many contexts significantly improves representational quality under intrinsic evaluation. Complementary to analyzing representational quality, we consider social biases encoded in pretrained representations with respect to gender, race/ethnicity, and religion and find that bias is encoded disparately across pretrained models and internal layers even for models with the same training data. Concerningly, we find dramatic inconsistencies between social bias estimators for word embeddings.},

	abstract = {Topic models are widely used for thematic structure discovery in text. But traditional topic models often require dedicated inference procedures for specific tasks at hand. Also, they are not designed to generate word-level semantic representations. To address the limitations, we propose a neural topic modeling approach based on the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), called Adversarial-neural Topic Model (ATM) in this paper. To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt to use adversarial training for topic modeling. The proposed ATM models topics with dirichlet prior and employs a generator network to capture the semantic patterns among latent topics. Meanwhile, the generator could also produce word-level semantic representations. Besides, to illustrate the feasibility of porting ATM to tasks other than topic modeling, we apply ATM for open domain event extraction. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed ATM, two topic modeling benchmark corpora and an event dataset are employed in the experiments. Our experimental results on benchmark corpora show that ATM generates more coherence topics (considering five topic coherence measures), outperforming a number of competitive baselines. Moreover, the experiments on event dataset also validate that the proposed approach is able to extract meaningful events from news articles.},

Traditional inference methods have sought closed-form derivations for updating the models, however as the expressiveness of these models grows, so does the difficulty of performing fast and accurate inference over their parameters. This paper presents alternative neural approaches to topic modelling by providing parameterisable distributions over topics which permit training by backpropagation in the framework of neural variational inference. In addition, with the help of a stick-breaking construction, we propose a recurrent network that is able to discover a notionally unbounded number of topics, analogous to Bayesian non-parametric topic models. Experimental results on the MXM Song Lyrics, 20NewsGroups and Reuters News datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of these neural topic models.},

	abstract = {To extract structured representations of newsworthy events from Twitter, unsupervised models typically assume that tweets involving the same named entities and expressed using similar words are likely to belong to the same event. Hence, they group tweets into clusters based on the co-occurrence patterns of named entities and topical keywords. However, there are two main limitations. First, they require the number of events to be known beforehand, which is not realistic in practical applications. Second, they don{'}t recognise that the same named entity might be referred to by multiple mentions and tweets using different mentions would be wrongly assigned to different events. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-parametric Bayesian mixture model with word embeddings for event extraction, in which the number of events can be inferred automatically and the issue of lexical variations for the same named entity can be dealt with properly. Our model has been evaluated on three datasets with sizes ranging between 2,499 and over 60 million tweets. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the baseline approach on all datasets by 5-8{\%} in F-measure.},

@inproceedings{wang_2019_open_event_extraction_from_online_text_using_a_generative_adversarial_network,
	abstract = {To extract the structured representations of open-domain events, Bayesian graphical models have made some progress. However, these approaches typically assume that all words in a document are generated from a single event. While this may be true for short text such as tweets, such an assumption does not generally hold for long text such as news articles. Moreover, Bayesian graphical models often rely on Gibbs sampling for parameter inference which may take long time to converge. To address these limitations, we propose an event extraction model based on Generative Adversarial Nets, called Adversarial-neural Event Model (AEM). AEM models an event with a Dirichlet prior and uses a generator network to capture the patterns underlying latent events. A discriminator is used to distinguish documents reconstructed from the latent events and the original documents. A byproduct of the discriminator is that the features generated by the learned discriminator network allow the visualization of the extracted events. Our model has been evaluated on two Twitter datasets and a news article dataset. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the baseline approaches on all the datasets, with more significant improvements observed on the news article dataset where an increase of 15{\%} is observed in F-measure.},

	abstract = {As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, understanding the global impact of non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) is important for formulating effective intervention strategies, particularly as many countries prepare for future waves. We used a machine learning approach to distill latent topics related to NPI from large-scale international news media. We hypothesize that these topics are informative about the timing and nature of implemented NPI, dependent on the source of the information (e.g., local news versus official government announcements) and the target countries. Given a set of latent topics associated with NPI (e.g., self-quarantine, social distancing, online education, etc), we assume that countries and media sources have different prior distributions over these topics, which are sampled to generate the news articles. To model the source-specific topic priors, we developed a semi-supervised, multi-source, dynamic, embedded topic model. Our model is able to simultaneously infer latent topics and learn a linear classifier to predict NPI labels using the topic mixtures as input for each news article. To learn these models, we developed an efficient end-to-end amortized variational inference algorithm. We applied our models to news data collected and labelled by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN). Through comprehensive experiments, we observed superior topic quality and intervention prediction accuracy, compared to the baseline embedded topic models, which ignore information on media source and intervention labels. The inferred latent topics reveal distinct policies and media framing in different countries and media sources, and also characterize reaction to COVID-19 and NPI in a semantically meaningful manner. Our PyTorch code is available on Github (htps://github.com/li-lab-mcgill/covid19_media).},

Compared to the last year, this year the shared task includes two new main metrics to measure the morphological tagging and lemmatization accuracies in addition to syntactic trees. Basing our motivation into these new metrics, we developed an end-to-end parsing pipeline especially focusing on developing a novel and state-of-the-art component for lemmatization. Our system reached the highest aggregate ranking on three main metrics out of 26 teams by achieving 1st place on metric involving lemmatization, and 2nd on both morphological tagging and parsing.},

	abstract = {The clustering-based unsupervised relation discovery method has gradually become one of the important methods of open relation extraction (OpenRE). However, high-dimensional vectors can encode complex linguistic information which leads to the problem that the derived clusters cannot explicitly align with the relational semantic classes. In this work, we propose a relation-oriented clustering model and use it to identify the novel relations in the unlabeled data. Specifically, to enable the model to learn to cluster relational data, our method leverages the readily available labeled data of pre-defined relations to learn a relation-oriented representation. We minimize distance between the instance with same relation by gathering the instances towards their corresponding relation centroids to form a cluster structure, so that the learned representation is cluster-friendly. To reduce the clustering bias on predefined classes, we optimize the model by minimizing a joint objective on both labeled and unlabeled data. Experimental results show that our method reduces the error rate by 29.2{\%} and 15.7{\%}, on two datasets respectively, compared with current SOTA methods.},

@inproceedings{yang_2020_adversarial_learning_for_robust_deep_clustering,
	abstract = {Deep clustering integrates embedding and clustering together to obtain the optimal nonlinear embedding space, which is more effective in real-world scenarios compared with conventional clustering methods. However, the robustness of the clustering network is prone to being attenuated especially when it encounters an adversarial attack. A small perturbation in the embedding space will lead to diverse clustering results since the labels are absent. In this paper, we propose a robust deep clustering method based on adversarial learning. Specifically, we first attempt to define adversarial samples in the embedding space for the clustering network. Meanwhile, we devise an adversarial attack strategy to explore samples that easily fool the clustering layers but do not impact the performance of the deep embedding. We then provide a simple yet efficient defense algorithm to improve the robustness of the clustering network. Experimental results on two popular datasets show that the proposed adversarial learning method can significantly enhance the robustness and further improve the overall clustering performance. Particularly, the proposed method is generally applicable to multiple existing clustering frameworks to boost their robustness.},

We assume an invariance that sentences are natural even if the words in the sentences are replaced with other words with paradigmatic relations. We stochastically replace words with other words that are predicted by a bi-directional language model at the word positions. Words predicted according to a context are numerous but appropriate for the augmentation of the original words. Furthermore, we retrofit a language model with a label-conditional architecture, which allows the model to augment sentences without breaking the label-compatibility. Through the experiments for six various different text classification tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed method improves classifiers based on the convolutional or recurrent neural networks.},

For the Poisson gamma belief network (PGBN), a recently proposed deep discrete LVM, we derive an alternative representation that is referred to as deep latent Dirichlet allocation (DLDA). Exploiting data augmentation and marginalization techniques, we derive a block-diagonal Fisher information matrix and its inverse for the simplex-constrained global model parameters of DLDA. Exploiting that Fisher information matrix with stochastic gradient MCMC, we present topic-layer-adaptive stochastic gradient Riemannian (TLASGR) MCMC that jointly learns simplex-constrained global parameters across all layers and topics, with topic and layer specific learning rates. State-of-the-art results are demonstrated on big data sets.},

Compared with Transformers, topic models are better at learning explicit document semantics, and hence could be integrated into Transformers to further boost their performance. To this end, we rearrange and explore the semantics learned by a topic model, and then propose a topic assistant (TA) including three modules. TA is compatible with various Transformer-based models and user-friendly since i) TA is a plug-and-play model that does not break any structure of the original Transformer network, making users easily fine-tune Transformer+TA based on a well pre-trained model; ii) TA only introduces a small number of extra parameters. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that TA is able to improve the performance of several Transformer-based models.},

@inproceedings{guo_2017_improved_deep_embedded_clustering_with_local_structure_preservation,
	abstract = {Deep clustering learns deep feature representations that favor clustering task using neural networks. Some pioneering work proposes to simultaneously learn embedded features and perform clustering by explicitly defining a clustering oriented loss. Though promising performance has been demonstrated in various applications, we observe that a vital ingredient has been overlooked by these work that the defined clustering loss may corrupt feature space, which leads to non-representative meaningless features and this in turn hurts clustering performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Improved Deep Embedded Clustering (IDEC) algorithm to take care of data structure preservation. Specifically, we manipulate feature space to scatter data points using a clustering loss as guidance. To constrain the manipulation and maintain the local structure of data generating distribution, an under-complete autoencoder is applied. By integrating the clustering loss and autoencoder's reconstruction loss, IDEC can jointly optimize cluster labels assignment and learn features that are suitable for clustering with local structure preservation. The resultant optimization problem can be effectively solved by mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation. Experiments on image and text datasets empirically validate the importance of local structure preservation and the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

@inproceedings{wang_2020_neural_topic_model_with_attention_for_supervised_learning,
	abstract = {Topic modeling utilizing neural variational inference has shown promising results recently. Unlike traditional Bayesian topic models, neural topic models use deep neural network to approximate the intractable marginal distribution and thus gain strong generalisation ability. However, neural topic models are unsupervised model. Directly using the document-specific topic proportions in downstream prediction tasks could lead to sub-optimal performance. This paper presents Topic Attention Model (TAM), a supervised neural topic model that integrates an attention recurrent neural network (RNN) model. We design a novel way to utilize document-specific topic proportions and global topic vectors learned from neural topic model in the attention mechanism. We also develop backpropagation inference method that allows for joint model optimisation.  Experimental results on three public datasets show that TAM  not only significantly improves supervised learning tasks, including classification and regression, but also achieves lower perplexity for the document modeling.},

@inproceedings{wu_2018_tracing_fake_news_footprints_characterizing_social_media_messages_by_how_they_propagate,
	abstract = {When a message, such as a piece of news, spreads in social networks, how can we classify it into categories of interests, such as genuine or fake news? Classification of social media content is a fundamental task for social media mining, and most existing methods regard it as a text categorization problem and mainly focus on using content features, such as words and hashtags. However, for many emerging applications like fake news and rumor detection, it is very challenging, if not impossible, to identify useful features from content. For example, intentional spreaders of fake news may manipulate the content to make it look like real news. To address this problem, this paper concentrates on modeling the propagation of messages in a social network. Specifically, we propose a novel approach, TraceMiner, to (1) infer embeddings of social media users with social network structures; and (2) utilize an LSTM-RNN to represent and classify propagation pathways of a message. Since content information is sparse and noisy on social media, adopting TraceMiner allows to provide a high degree of classification accuracy even in the absence of content information. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the superiority over state-of-the-art approaches on the task of fake news detection and news categorization.},

	abstract = {Workers of microtask crowdsourcing marketplaces strive to find a balance between the need for monetary income and the need for high reputation. Such balance is often threatened by poorly formulated tasks, as workers attempt their execution despite a sub-optimal understanding of the work to be done.In this paper we highlight the role of clarity as a characterising property of tasks in crowdsourcing. We surveyed 100 workers of the CrowdFlower platform to verify the presence of issues with task clarity in crowdsourcing marketplaces, reveal how crowd workers deal with such issues, and motivate the need for mechanisms that can predict and measure task clarity. Next, we propose a novel model for task clarity based on the goal and role clarity constructs. We sampled 7.1K tasks from the Amazon mTurk marketplace, and acquired labels for task clarity from crowd workers. We show that task clarity is coherently perceived by crowd workers, and is affected by the type of the task. We then propose a set of features to capture task clarity, and use the acquired labels to train and validate a supervised machine learning model for task clarity prediction. Finally, we perform a long-term analysis of the evolution of task clarity on Amazon mTurk, and show that clarity is not a property suitable for temporal characterisation.},

	abstract = {Crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) are widely used by organizations, researchers, and individuals to outsource a broad range of tasks to crowd workers. Prior research has shown that crowdsourcing can pose privacy risks (e.g., de-anonymization) to crowd workers. However, little is known about the specific privacy issues crowd workers have experienced and how they perceive the state of privacy in crowdsourcing. In this paper, we present results from an online survey of 435 MTurk crowd workers from the US, India, and other countries and areas. Our respondents reported different types of privacy concerns (e.g., data aggregation, profiling, scams), experiences of privacy losses (e.g., phishing, malware, stalking, targeted ads), and privacy expectations on MTurk (e.g., screening tasks).

	abstract = {Tasks on crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk often request workers' personal information, raising privacy risks that may be exacerbated by requester-worker power dynamics. We interviewed 14 workers to understand how they navigate these risks. We found that Turkers' decisions to provide personal information during tasks were based on evaluations of the pay rate, the requester, the purpose, and the perceived sensitivity of the request. Participants also engaged in multiple privacy-protective behaviors, such as abandoning tasks or providing inaccurate data, though there were costs associated with these behaviors, such as wasted time and risk of rejection. Finally, their privacy concerns and practices evolved as they learned about both the platform and worker-designed tools and forums. These findings deepen our understanding of both privacy decision-making and invisible labor in paid crowdsourcing, and emphasize a general need to understand how privacy stances change over time.},

However, existing topic models fail to learn interpretable topics when working with large and heavy-tailed vocabularies. To this end, we develop the embedded topic model (etm), a generative model of documents that marries traditional topic models with word embeddings. More specifically, the etm models each word with a categorical distribution whose natural parameter is the inner product between the word{'}s embedding and an embedding of its assigned topic. To fit the etm, we develop an efficient amortized variational inference algorithm. The etm discovers interpretable topics even with large vocabularies that include rare words and stop words. It outperforms existing document models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, in terms of both topic quality and predictive performance.},

Then, we extend the model to asynchronous conversations by incorporating the underlying conversational structure in the entity grid representation and feature computation. Our model achieves state of the art results on standard coherence assessment tasks in monologue and conversations outperforming existing models. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in reconstructing thread structures.},

While these techniques work well for sentences, they can not easily be applied to short text because of its shortness and sparsity. In this paper, we propose a framework based on convolutional neural networks that combines explicit and implicit representations of short text for classification. We first conceptualize a short text as a set of relevant concepts using a large taxonomy knowledge base. We then obtain the embedding of short text by coalescing the words and relevant concepts on top of pre-trained word vectors. We further incorporate character level features into our model to capture fine-grained subword information. Experimental results on five commonly used datasets show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

In this work, we focus on context-aware topic classification methods for identifying topics in free-form human-chatbot dialogs. We extend previous work on neural topic classification and unsupervised topic keyword detection by incorporating conversational context and dialog act features. On annotated data, we show that incorporating context and dialog acts leads to relative gains in topic classification accuracy by 35% and on unsupervised keyword detection recall by 11% for conversational interactions where topics frequently span multiple utterances. We show that topical metrics such as topical depth is highly correlated with dialog evaluation metrics such as coherence and engagement implying that conversational topic models can predict user satisfaction. Our work for detecting conversation topics and keywords can be used to guide chatbots towards coherent dialog.},

	abstract = {Conversational agents are exploding in popularity. However, much work remains in the area of social conversation as well as free-form conversation over a broad range of domains and topics. To advance the state of the art in conversational AI, Amazon launched the Alexa Prize, a 2.5-million-dollar university competition where sixteen selected university teams were challenged to build conversational agents, known as socialbots, to converse coherently and engagingly with humans on popular topics such as Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Fashion and Technology for 20 minutes. The Alexa Prize offers the academic community a unique opportunity to perform research with a live system used by millions of users. The competition provided university teams with real user conversational data at scale, along with the user-provided ratings and feedback augmented with annotations by the Alexa team. This enabled teams to effectively iterate and make improvements throughout the competition while being evaluated in real-time through live user interactions. To build their socialbots, university teams combined state-of-the-art techniques with novel strategies in the areas of Natural Language Understanding, Context Modeling, Dialog Management, Response Generation, and Knowledge Acquisition. To support the efforts of participating teams, the Alexa Prize team made significant scientific and engineering investments to build and improve Conversational Speech Recognition, Topic Tracking, Dialog Evaluation, Voice User Experience, and tools for traffic management and scalability. This paper outlines the advances created by the university teams as well as the Alexa Prize team to achieve the common goal of solving the problem of Conversational AI.},

@article{krause_2017_edina_building_an_open_domain_socialbot_with_self_dialogues,
	abstract = {We present Edina, the University of Edinburgh's social bot for the Amazon Alexa Prize competition. Edina is a conversational agent whose responses utilize data harvested from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) through an innovative new technique we call self-dialogues. These are conversations in which a single AMT Worker plays both participants in a dialogue. Such dialogues are surprisingly natural, efficient to collect and reflective of relevant and/or trending topics. These self-dialogues provide training data for a generative neural network as well as a basis for soft rules used by a matching score component. Each match of a soft rule against a user utterance is associated with a confidence score which we show is strongly indicative of reply quality, allowing this component to self-censor and be effectively integrated with other components. Edina's full architecture features a rule-based system backing off to a matching score, backing off to a generative neural network. Our hybrid data-driven methodology thus addresses both coverage limitations of a strictly rule-based approach and the lack of guarantees of a strictly machine-learning approach.},

	abstract = {Continuous word representations, trained on large unlabeled corpora are useful for many natural language processing tasks. Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character $n$-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character $n$-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.},

We propose to evaluate dialog quality using topic-based metrics that describe the ability of a conversational bot to sustain coherent and engaging conversations on a topic, and the diversity of topics that a bot can handle. To detect conversation topics per utterance, we adopt Deep Average Networks (DAN) and train a topic classifier on a variety of question and query data categorized into multiple topics. We propose a novel extension to DAN by adding a topic-word attention table that allows the system to jointly capture topic keywords in an utterance and perform topic classification. We compare our proposed topic based metrics with the ratings provided by users and show that our metrics both correlate with and complement human judgment. Our analysis is performed on tens of thousands of real human-bot dialogs from the Alexa Prize competition and highlights user expectations for conversational bots.},

For both variants, we investigate and report the relationship between model complexity, resource consumption, the availability of transfer task training data, and task performance. Comparisons are made with baselines that use word level transfer learning via pretrained word embeddings as well as baselines do not use any transfer learning. We find that transfer learning using sentence embeddings tends to outperform word level transfer. With transfer learning via sentence embeddings, we observe surprisingly good performance with minimal amounts of supervised training data for a transfer task. We obtain encouraging results on Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT) targeted at detecting model bias.

To quantify partisan audience bias, we developed a domain-level score by leveraging the sharing propensities of registered voters on a large Twitter panel. We found little evidence for the "filter bubble'' hypothesis. Instead, we found that results positioned toward the bottom of Google SERPs were more left-leaning than results positioned toward the top, and that the direction and magnitude of overall lean varied by search query, component type (e.g. "answer boxes"), and other factors. Utilizing rank-weighted metrics that we adapted from prior work, we also found that Google's rankings shifted the average lean of SERPs to the right of their unweighted average.},

We argue that designing for contestability in these systems can assist in surfacing values, aligning system design and use with context, and building legitimacy. However, designing for contestability can be challenging, particularly in systems that are designed to be opaque: systems need to accurately surface embedded values, expose decision making processes in ways that are meaningful for users, support engagement with and allow influence over system performance, and so on. In addition to these technical aspects, designing for contestability may by challenged by the need to protect intellectual property and prevent gaming of the system. In this workshop, we will address goals, audiences, and designs for contestability in algorithmic systems.

	abstract = {Social computing researchers are beginning to apply machine learning tools to classify and analyze social media data. Our interest in understanding politeness in an online community focused our attention on tools that would help automate politeness analysis. This paper highlights one popular classification tool designed to score the politeness of text. Our application of this tool to Wikipedia data yielded some unexpected results. Those unexpected results led us to question how the tool worked and its effectiveness relative to human judgment and classification. We designed a user study to revalidate the tool with crowdworkers labeling samples of content from Wikipedia talk pages, imitating the original efforts to validate the tool. This revalidation points to challenges for automatic labeling. Based on our results, this paper reconsiders politeness in online communities as well as broader trends in the use of machine classifiers in social computing research.},

@article{scheuerman_2019_how_computers_see_gender_an_evaluation_of_gender_classification_in_commercial_facial_analysis_services,
	abstract = {Investigations of facial analysis (FA) technologies-such as facial detection and facial recognition-have been central to discussions about Artificial Intelligence's (AI) impact on human beings. Research on automatic gender recognition, the classification of gender by FA technologies, has raised potential concerns around issues of racial and gender bias. In this study, we augment past work with empirical data by conducting a systematic analysis of how gender classification and gender labeling in computer vision services operate when faced with gender diversity. We sought to understand how gender is concretely conceptualized and encoded into commercial facial analysis and image labeling technologies available today. We then conducted a two-phase study: (1) a system analysis of ten commercial FA and image labeling services and (2) an evaluation of five services using a custom dataset of diverse genders using self-labeled Instagram images. Our analysis highlights how gender is codified into both classifiers and data standards. We found that FA services performed consistently worse on transgender individuals and were universally unable to classify non-binary genders. In contrast, image labeling often presented multiple gendered concepts. We also found that user perceptions about gender performance and identity contradict the way gender performance is encoded into the computer vision infrastructure. We discuss our findings from three perspectives of gender identity (self-identity, gender performativity, and demographic identity) and how these perspectives interact across three layers: the classification infrastructure, the third-party applications that make use of that infrastructure, and the individuals who interact with that software. We employ Bowker and Star's concepts of "torque" and "residuality" to further discuss the social implications of gender classification. We conclude by outlining opportunities for creating more inclusive classification infrastructures and datasets, as well as with implications for policy.},

@article{fiebrink_2018_introduction_to_the_special_issue_on_human_centered_machine_learning,
	abstract = {Machine learning is one of the most important and successful techniques in contemporary computer science. Although it can be applied to myriad problems of human interest, research in machine learning is often framed in an impersonal way, as merely algorithms being applied to model data. However, this viewpoint hides considerable human work of tuning the algorithms, gathering the data, deciding what should be modeled in the first place, and using the outcomes of machine learning in the real world. Examining machine learning from a human-centered perspective includes explicitly recognizing human work, as well as reframing machine learning workflows based on situated human working practices, and exploring the co-adaptation of humans and intelligent systems. A human-centered understanding of machine learning in human contexts can lead not only to more usable machine learning tools, but to new ways of understanding what machine learning is good for and how to make it more useful. This special issue brings together nine articles that present different ways to frame machine learning in a human context. They represent very different application areas (from medicine to audio) and methodologies (including machine learning methods, human-computer interaction methods, and hybrids), but they all explore the human contexts in which machine learning is used. This introduction summarizes the articles in this issue and draws out some common themes.},

We interviewed 13 designers who had many years of experience designing the UX of ML-enhanced products and services. We probed them to characterize their practices. They shared they do not view themselves as ML experts, nor do they think learning more about ML would make them better designers. Instead, our participants appeared to be the most successful when they engaged in ongoing collaboration with data scientists to help envision what to make and when they embraced a data-centric culture. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of UX education and as opportunities for additional design research in support of UX designers working with ML.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is now a fairly established technology, and user experience (UX) designers appear regularly to integrate ML services in new apps, devices, and systems. Interestingly, this technology has not experienced a wealth of design innovation that other technologies have, and this might be because it is a new and difficult design material. To better understand why we have witnessed little design innovation, we conducted a survey of current UX practitioners with regards to how new ML services are envisioned and developed in UX practice. Our survey probed on how ML may or may not have been a part of their UX design education, on how they work to create new things with developers, and on the challenges they have faced working with this material. We use the findings from this survey and our review of related literature to present a series of challenges for UX and interaction design research and education. Finally, we discuss areas where new research and new curriculum might help our community unlock the power of design thinking to re-imagine what ML might be and might do.},

@article{zhou_2016_nonparametric_bayesian_negative_binomial_factor_analysis,
	abstract = {A common approach to analyze a covariate-sample count matrix, an element of which represents how many times a covariate appears in a sample, is to factorize it under the Poisson likelihood. We show its limitation in capturing the tendency for a covariate present in a sample to both repeat itself and excite related ones. To address this limitation, we construct negative binomial factor analysis (NBFA) to factorize the matrix under the negative binomial likelihood, and relate it to a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution based mixed-membership model. To support countably infinite factors, we propose the hierarchical gamma-negative binomial process. By exploiting newly proved connections between discrete distributions, we construct two blocked and a collapsed Gibbs sampler that all adaptively truncate their number of factors, and demonstrate that the blocked Gibbs sampler developed under a compound Poisson representation converges fast and has low computational complexity. Example results show that NBFA has a distinct mechanism in adjusting its number of inferred factors according to the sample lengths, and provides clear advantages in parsimonious representation, predictive power, and computational complexity over previously proposed discrete latent variable models, which either completely ignore burstiness, or model only the burstiness of the covariates but not that of the factors.},

@article{srivastava_2017_autoencoding_variational_inference_for_topic_models,
	abstract = {Topic models are one of the most popular methods for learning representations of text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires mathematically deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to address this problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has proven diffi- cult to apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to our knowledge the first effective AEVB based inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Model (AVITM). This model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet prior and by component collapsing. We find that AVITM matches traditional methods in accuracy with much better inference time. Indeed, because of the inference network, we find that it is unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black box, it is readily applied to new topic models. As a dramatic illustration of this, we present a new topic model called ProdLDA, that replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By changing only one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA yields much more interpretable topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs sampling.},

@inproceedings{naesseth_2017_reparameterization_gradients_through_acceptance_rejection_sampling_algorithms,
	abstract = {Variational inference using the reparameterization trick has enabled large-scale approximate Bayesian inference in complex probabilistic models, leveraging stochastic optimization to sidestep intractable expectations. The reparameterization trick is applicable when we can simulate a random variable by applying a differentiable deterministic function on an auxiliary random variable whose distribution is fixed. For many distributions of interest (such as the gamma or Dirichlet), simulation of random variables relies on acceptance-rejection sampling. The discontinuity introduced by the accept-reject step means that standard reparameterization tricks are not applicable. We propose a new method that lets us leverage reparameterization gradients even when variables are outputs of a acceptance-rejection sampling algorithm. Our approach enables reparameterization on a larger class of variational distributions. In several studies of real and synthetic data, we show that the variance of the estimator of the gradient is significantly lower than other state-of-the-art methods. This leads to faster convergence of stochastic gradient variational inference.},

@article{zhao_2019_variational_autoencoders_for_sparse_and_overdispersed_discrete_data,
	abstract = {Many applications, such as text modelling, high-throughput sequencing, and recommender systems, require analysing sparse, high-dimensional, and overdispersed discrete (count-valued or binary) data. Although probabilistic matrix factorisation and linear/nonlinear latent factor models have enjoyed great success in modelling such data, many existing models may have inferior modelling performance due to the insufficient capability of modelling overdispersion in count-valued data and model misspecification in general. In this paper, we comprehensively study these issues and propose a variational autoencoder based framework that generates discrete data via negative-binomial distribution. We also examine the model's ability to capture properties, such as self- and cross-excitations in discrete data, which is critical for modelling overdispersion. We conduct extensive experiments on three important problems from discrete data analysis: text analysis, collaborative filtering, and multi-label learning. Compared with several state-of-the-art baselines, the proposed models achieve significantly better performance on the above problems.},

Geo-tagged social media data are useful resource for this task; however, the abundance of everyday language in them makes this task still challenging. To address such challenges, we present TopicOnTiles, a visual analytics system that can reveal information relevant to anomalous events in a multi-level tile-based map interface by using social media data. To this end, we adopt and improve a recently proposed topic modeling method that can extract spatio-temporally exclusive topics corresponding to a particular region and a time point. Furthermore, we utilize a tile-based map interface to efficiently handle large-scale data in parallel. Our user interface effectively highlights anomalous tiles using our novel glyph visualization that encodes the degree of anomaly computed by our exclusive topic modeling processes. To show the effectiveness of our system, we present several usage scenarios using real-world datasets as well as comprehensive user study results.},

Instead, we seek models that can learn the feature representations upon which to condition topic selection. We present deep Dirichlet Multinomial Regression (dDMR), a generative topic model that simultaneously learns document feature representations and topics. We evaluate dDMR on three datasets: New York Times articles with fine-grained tags, Amazon product reviews with product images, and Reddit posts with subreddit identity. dDMR learns representations that outperform DMR and LDA according to heldout perplexity and are more effective at downstream predictive tasks as the number of topics grows. Additionally, human subjects judge dDMR topics as being more representative of associated document features. Finally, we find that supervision leads to faster convergence as compared to an LDA baseline and that dDMR{'}s model fit is less sensitive to training parameters than DMR.},

	abstract = {Electronic health records (EHRs) provide rich clinical information and the opportunities to extract epidemiological patterns to understand and predict patient disease risks with suitable machine learning methods such as topic models. However, existing topic models do not generate identifiable topics each predicting a unique phenotype. One promising direction is to use known phenotype concepts to guide topic inference. We present a seed-guided Bayesian topic model called MixEHR-Seed with 3 contributions: (1) for each phenotype, we infer a dual-form of topic distribution: a seed-topic distribution over a small set of key EHR codes and a regular topic distribution over the entire EHR vocabulary; (2) we model age-dependent disease progression as Markovian dynamic topic priors; (3) we infer seed-guided multi-modal topics over distinct EHR data types. For inference, we developed a variational inference algorithm. Using MixEHR-Seed, we inferred 1569 PheCode-guided phenotype topics from an EHR database in Quebec, Canada covering 1.3 million patients for up to 20-year follow-up with 122 million records for 8539 and 1126 unique diagnostic and drug codes, respectively. We observed (1) accurate phenotype prediction by the guided topics, (2) clinically relevant PheCode-guided disease topics, (3) meaningful age-dependent disease prevalence.

@inproceedings{ahmadvand_2019_concet_entity_aware_topic_classification_for_open_domain_conversational_agents,
	abstract = {Identifying the topic (domain) of each user's utterance in open-domain conversational systems is a crucial step for all subsequent language understanding and response tasks. In particular, for complex domains, an utterance is often routed to a single component responsible for that domain. Thus, correctly mapping a user utterance to the right domain is critical. This is a challenging task: users could mention entities like actors, singers or locations to implicitly indicate the domain, which requires extensive domain knowledge to interpret. To address this problem, we introduce ConCET: a Concurrent Entity-aware conversational Topic classifier, which incorporates entity type information together with the utterance content features. Specifically, ConCET utilizes entity information to enrich the utterance representation, combining character, word, and entity type embeddings into a single representation. However, for rich domains with millions of available entities, unrealistic amounts of labeled training data would be required. To complement our model, we propose a simple and effective method for generating synthetic training data, to augment the typically limited amounts of labeled training data, using commonly available knowledge bases as to generate additional labeled utterances. We extensively evaluate ConCET and our proposed training method first on an openly available human-human conversational dataset called Self-Dialogue, to calibrate our approach against previous state-of-the-art methods; second, we evaluate ConCET on a large dataset of human-machine conversations with real users, collected as part of the Amazon Alexa Prize. Our results show that ConCET significantly improves topic classification performance on both datasets, reaching 8-10% improvements compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods. We complement our quantitative results with detailed analysis of system performance, which could be used for further improvements of conversational agents.},

Our study reveals widespread disparity in what types of distress receive supportive condolence rather than just engagement. Building on studies from social psychology, we analyze the language of condolence and develop a new dataset for quantifying the empathy in a condolence using appraisal theory. Finally, we demonstrate that the features of condolence individuals find most helpful online differ substantially in their features from those seen in interpersonal settings.},

	abstract = {Driven by recent advances in neural networks, various Deep Embedding Clustering (DEC) based short text clustering models are being developed. In these works, latent representation learning and text clustering are performed simultaneously. Although these methods are becoming increasingly popular, they use pure cluster-oriented objectives, which can produce meaningless representations. To alleviate this problem, several improvements have been developed to introduce additional learning objectives in the clustering process, such as models based on contrastive learning. However, existing efforts rely heavily on learning meaningful representations at the instance level. They have limited focus on learning global representations, which are necessary to capture the overall data structure at the cluster level. In this paper, we propose a novel DEC model, which we named the deep embedded clustering model with cluster-level representation learning (DECCRL) to jointly learn cluster and instance level representations. Here, we extend the embedded topic modelling approach to introduce reconstruction constraints to help learn cluster-level representations. Experimental results on real-world short text datasets demonstrate that our model produces meaningful clusters.},

To learn about the major problems, we provide a short but comprehensive survey based on two complementary studies: (1) a literature review where we collect and organize problems known from interviews with workers, and (2) an empirical data analysis where we use topic modeling to mine workers{'} complaints from a new English corpus of workers{'} forum discussions. While literature covers all process phases, problems in the task evaluation are prevalent, including unfair rejections, late payments, and unjustified blockings of workers.

To address this issue, we propose a model-free context-aware word composition model, which employs the latent semantic information as global context for learning representations. The proposed model attempts to resolve the word sense disambiguation and word composition in a unified framework. Extensive evaluation shows consistent improvements over various strong word representation/composition models at different granularities (including word, phrase and sentence), demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

Neural variational inference algorithms are developed to infer model parameters by using the reparameterization of Gamma distribution and the Gaussian approximation of Poisson distribution. Experiments on real-world datasets indicate that our models outperform state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of perplexity and topic coherence.

Phrase-BERT outperforms baselines across a variety of phrase-level similarity tasks, while also demonstrating increased lexical diversity between nearest neighbors in the vector space. Finally, as a case study, we show that Phrase-BERT embeddings can be easily integrated with a simple autoencoder to build a phrase-based neural topic model that interprets topics as mixtures of words and phrases by performing a nearest neighbor search in the embedding space. Crowdsourced evaluations demonstrate that this phrase-based topic model produces more coherent and meaningful topics than baseline word and phrase-level topic models, further validating the utility of Phrase-BERT.},

	abstract = {Taxonomy construction is not only a fundamental task for semantic analysis of text corpora, but also an important step for applications such as information filtering, recommendation, and Web search. Existing pattern-based methods extract hypernym-hyponym term pairs and then organize these pairs into a taxonomy. However, by considering each term as an independent concept node, they overlook the topical proximity and the semantic correlations among terms. In this paper, we propose a method for constructing topic taxonomies, wherein every node represents a conceptual topic and is defined as a cluster of semantically coherent concept terms. Our method, TaxoGen, uses term embeddings and hierarchical clustering to construct a topic taxonomy in a recursive fashion. To ensure the quality of the recursive process, it consists of: (1) an adaptive spherical clustering module for allocating terms to proper levels when splitting a coarse topic into fine-grained ones; (2) a local embedding module for learning term embeddings that maintain strong discriminative power at different levels of the taxonomy. Our experiments on two real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TaxoGen compared with baseline methods.},

	abstract = {Tweets summarization aims to find a group of representative tweets for a specific topic. In recent times, there have been several research efforts toward devising a variety of techniques to summarize tweets in Twitter. However, these techniques are either not personal (i.e., consider only tweets in the timeline of a specific user) or are too expensive to be realized on a mobile device. Given that 80% of active Twitter users access the site on mobile devices, in this demonstration we present a lightweight, personalized, on-demand, topic modeling-based tweets summarization engine called TOTEM, designed for such devices. Specifically, TOTEM summarizes most recent tweets on a user's timeline and enables her to visualize and navigate representative topics and associated tweets in a user-friendly tap-and-swipe manner.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to identify the customers' primary topics of concern regarding online retail brands that are shared among Twitter users. This study collects tweets associated with five leading UK online retailers covering the period from Black Friday to Christmas and New Year's sales. We use a combination of text analytical approaches including topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and network analysis to analyse the tweets. Through the analysis, we identify that delivery, product and customer service are among the most-discussed topics on Twitter. We also highlight the areas that receive the most negative customer sentiments such as delivery and customer service. Interestingly, we also identify emerging topics such as online engagement and in-store experience that are not captured by the existing literature on online retailing. Through a network analysis, we underscore the relationships among those important topics. This study derives insights on how well the leading online retail brands are performing and how their products and services are perceived by their customers. These insights can help businesses understand customers better and enable them to convert the information into meaningful knowledge to improve their business performance. The study offers a novel approach of transforming social media data into useful knowledge about online retailing. The incorporation of three analytical approaches offers insights for researchers to understand the hidden content behind the large collections of unstructured bodies of text, and this information can be used to improve online retailing services and reach out to customers.},

	abstract = {Research and development activities are regarded as one of the most influencing factors of the future of a country. Large investments in research can yield a tremendous outcome in terms of a country's overall wealth and strength. However, public financial resources of countries are often limited which calls for a wise and targeted investment. Scientific publications are considered as one of the main outputs of research investment. Although the general trend of scientific publications is increasing, a detailed analysis is required to monitor the research trends and assess whether they are in line with the top research priorities of the country. Such focused monitoring can shed light on scientific activities evolution as well as the formation of new research areas, thus helping governments to adjust priorities, if required. But monitoring the output of the funded research manually is not only very expensive and difficult, it is also subjective. Using structural topic models, in this paper we evaluated the trends in academic research performed by federally funded Canadian researchers during the time-frame of 2000--2018, covering more than 140,000 research publications. The proposed approach makes it possible to objectively and systematically monitor research projects, or any other set of documents related to research activities such as funding proposals, at large-scale. Our results confirm the accordance between the performed federally funded research projects and the top research priorities of Canada.},

@article{yang_2021_author_topic_model_for_co_occurring_normal_documents_and_short_texts_to_explore_individual_user_preferences,
	abstract = {The investigation of user preferences through user comments has attracted significant attention. Although topic models have been verified as useful tools to facilitate the understanding of textual contents, they cannot be directly applied to accomplish this task because of two problems. The first problem is the severe data sparsity suffered by user comments because they are generally short. The second problem is the mixture of opinions from both user comments and the original documents the users commented on. To simultaneously solve the data sparsity problem and explore clean user preferences, we propose an author co-occurring topic model (AOTM) for normal documents and their short user comments. By considering authorship, AOTM allows each author of short texts to have a probability distribution over a set of topics represented only short texts. Accordingly, the individual user preferences can be investigated based on these author-level distributions. We verify the performance of AOTM using two news article datasets and one e-commerce dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the AOTM outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in topic learning and topic representation of documents. The potential usage of AOTM in exploring individual user preferences is further illustrated by drawing user portraits and predicting user posting behaviors.},

@article{roeder_2022_data_driven_decision_making_in_credit_risk_management_the_information_value_of_analyst_reports,
	abstract = {Other than banks, non-financial companies also continuously monitor and analyze their credit risk exposure to avoid possible counterparty defaults. Credit default swaps are commonly used financial instruments that provide information on a counterparty's creditworthiness. Although this metric can provide crucial insights, the underlying price dynamics often remain unknown and require further explanation. Data-driven decision-making is a key concept for identifying these reasons and supporting and justifying decisions. In this paper, we provide such justifications by applying sentiment and topic analysis to company-related financial analyst reports. While the contents of financial news have been analyzed in the past, analyst reports can offer additional insights, as seasoned analysts use them to disseminate in-depth research to experienced investors. This analysis examines 3386 analyst reports covering constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index in the period from 2009 to 2020. The results suggest that even when established credit risk indicators and financial news are considered, the sentiment and a subset of topics are correlated with changes in the credit default swap spread, indicating a fundamental relationship between quantitative risk metric and analyst reports. We find that analyst reports contain information related to the change in credit default swap spreads, an insight that helps to improve our understanding of existing risk assessments. The outcome indicates that banks or corporate risk managers can benefit from complementing established financial metrics and even financial news data with new insights derived from analyst reports.},

This paper conducts a topic-based bibliometric study to detect and predict the topic changes of KnoSys from 1991 to 2016. A Latent Dirichlet Allocation model is used to profile the hotspots of KnoSys and predict possible future trends from a probabilistic perspective. A model of scientific evolutionary pathways applies a learning-based process to detect the topic changes of KnoSys in sequential time slices. Six main research areas of KnoSys are identified, i.e., expert systems, machine learning, data mining, decision making, optimization, and fuzzy, and the results also indicate that the interest of KnoSys communities in the area of computational intelligence is raised, and the ability to construct practical systems through knowledge use and accurate prediction models is highly emphasized. Such empirical insights can be used as a guide for KnoSys submissions.},

A text corpus of keywords was generated through a deep keyword generation model from abstracts of 346,387 articles published in 296 disciplines from 1917 to 2021. Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression topic modeling, interdisciplinarity indices, and network analysis were employed to analyze the collected corpus. Topic modeling uncovered 15 dominant research topics in the literacy field, as well as their up-and-down trends from 2000 to 2021. For each topic, keywords were then replaced with disciplines, and interdisciplinarity was measured using four indices: variety, balance, disparity, and diversity. Finally, the interdisciplinarity of each topic, connectivity between topics, and topic trends were comprehensively analyzed on the keyword co-occurrence network. Our methodology reaches beyond connectivity limited to a few disciplines and provides insight into the direction of collaboration between disciplines centered on a research domain. Moreover, the study's deep keyword generation model has methodological implications for forming a corpus spanning numerous disciplines as a bottom-up approach.},

The experimental results of a comparison of this method with four clustering baselines (i.e., k-means, fuzzy c-means, principal component analysis, and topic models) on two bibliometric datasets demonstrate its effectiveness across either a relatively broad range of disciplines or a given domain. An empirical study on bibliometric topic extraction from articles published by three top-tier bibliometric journals between 2000 and 2017, supported by expert knowledge-based evaluations, provides supplemental evidence of the method's ability on topic extraction. Additionally, this empirical analysis reveals insights into both overlapping and diverse research interests among the three journals that would benefit journal publishers, editorial boards, and research communities.},

	abstract = {Learning topics from short texts has become a critical and fundamental task for understanding the widely-spread streaming social messages, e.g., tweets, snippets and questions/answers. Up to date, there are two distinctive topic learning schemes: generative probabilistic graphical models and geometrically linear algebra approaches, with LDA and NMF being the representative works, respectively. Since these two methods both could uncover the latent topics hidden in the unstructured short texts, some interesting doubts are coming to our minds that which one is better and why? Are there any other more effective extensions? In order to explore valuable insights between LDA and NMF based learning schemes, we comprehensively conduct a series of experiments into two parts. Specifically, the basic LDA and NMF are compared with different experimental settings on several public short text datasets in the first part which would exhibit that NMF tends to perform better than LDA; in the second part, we propose a novel model called ``Knowledge-guided Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Better Short Text Topic Mining'' (abbreviated as KGNMF), which leverages external knowledge as a semantic regulator with low-rank formalizations, yielding up a time-efficient algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on three representative corpora with currently typical short text topic models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed KGNMF. Overall, learning with NMF-based schemes is another effective manner in short text topic mining in addition to the popular LDA-based paradigms.},

For topic integration into multiple paths, we employ latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) by utilizing the topic-document matrix that LDA derives to select an article's topic from the citation network, where each article is labeled with the topic that is assigned with the highest topical probability for that article.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, platform-facilitated collaborative consumption has recently become attractive to consumers. A comparative study of consumers' online review behavior and its impact on overall satisfaction and demand in the accommodation-sharing economy and the hotel industry indicates that consumers' perceptions and behavior change gradually with changes in the level of sharing---from no sharing when staying in hotel rooms to intensive sharing when sharing rooms through collaborative consumption. Online consumer reviews focus on product and service attributes, and the influential factors of customer satisfaction and demand differ when consumers are at different accommodation-sharing levels. Not all attributes described in online reviews influence overall customer satisfaction. With a higher level of sharing, consumers' valuation changes from more to less tangible attributes. Consumers at a higher sharing level care more about social interaction and economic value than consumers at a lower sharing level. Transaction costs, particularly the information search and acquisition costs, play an important role in influencing customer purchase decisions in the sharing economy. Consumers refer to direct information for tangible attributes and to previous consumers' online reviews for intangible attributes to familiarize themselves with details before making purchase decisions. Our study provides implications that help platforms and hosts better target consumer segments with different sharing levels and more effectively utilize online reviews to generate positive electronic word of mouth to enhance consumer demand and the performance of platform economics.},

	abstract = {Social media offers a new communication channel for users and affords an interactive opportunity between users and the firms about the products and the brands. Understanding what topics are important to users and the corresponding internal motivation is crucial for managers to successfully engage customers and promote business through social media. Assuming topic preference is the outcome of intrinsic factors such as gender, age and personality traits, this paper proposes an improved nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian topic (NHBT) model to investigate the multiple-to-multiple generative relationships from intrinsic factors to topic preferences. The proposed NHBT model employs a three-level generation framework based on Dirichlet process to study the impact of intrinsic factors on users topic preference. Our study of Facebook data shows that NHBT model is able to draw valuable latent topics (e.g. music band, chemical biology, cosplay) from the open social media environment, and reveal the internal motivation for users topic selection behaviors (e.g. users with low conscientiousness and high extraversion personality prefer topics about campus party). Our experiments also show that NHBT model can identify the intrinsic factors dominating topic preferences for individual users, and provide foundations to predict the intrinsic factors for new user generated contents.},

@article{alp_2018_identifying_topical_influencers_on_twitter_based_on_user_behavior_and_network_topology,
	abstract = {Social media web sites have become major media platforms to share personal information, news, photos, videos and more. Users can even share live streams whenever they want to reach out to many other. This prevalent usage of social media attracted companies, data scientists, and researchers who are trying to infer meaningful information from this vast amount of data. Information diffusion and maximizing the spread of words is one of the most important focus for researchers working on social media. This information can serve many purposes such as; user or content recommendation, viral marketing, and user modeling. In this research, finding topical influential/authority users on Twitter is addressed. Since Twitter is a good platform to spread knowledge as a word of mouth approach and it has many more public profiles than protected ones, it is a target media for marketers. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology, called Personalized PageRank, that integrates both the information obtained from network topology and the information obtained from user actions and activities in Twitter. The proposed approach aims to determine the topical influencers who are experts on a specific topic. Experimental results on a large dataset consisting of Turkish tweets show that using user specific features like topical focus rate, activeness, authenticity and speed of getting reaction on specific topics positively affects identifying influencers and lead to higher information diffusion. Algorithms are implemented on a distributed computing environment which makes high-cost graph processing more efficient.},

As a result, new evaluative tools are needed to help assess not only the knowledge production side of research programmes or organisations, but also the articulation of research agendas with societal needs. In this paper, we present an exploratory investigation of science supply and societal needs on the grand challenge of obesity -- an emerging health problem with enormous social costs. We illustrate a potential approach that uses topic modelling to explore: (a) how scientific publications can be used to describe existing priorities in science production; (b) how policy records (in this case here questions posed in the European parliament) can be used as an instance of mapping discourse of social needs; (c) how the comparison between the two may show (mis)alignments between societal concerns and scientific outputs. While this is a technical exercise, we propose that this type of mapping methods can be useful to domain experts for informing strategic planning and evaluation in funding agencies.},

@article{amon_2022_is_it_all_bafflegab____linguistic_and_meta_characteristics_of_research_articles_in_prestigious_economics_journals,
	abstract = {In competitive research environments, scholars have a natural interest to maximize the prestige associated with their scientific work. In order to identify factors that might help them address this goal more effectively, the scientometric literature has tried to link linguistic and meta characteristics of academic papers to the associated degree of scientific prestige, conceptualized as cumulative citation counts. In this paper, we take an alternative approach that instead understands scientific prestige in terms of the rankings of the journals that the articles appeared in, as such rankings are routinely used as surrogate research quality indicators. For the purpose of determining the most important drivers of suchlike prestige, we use state-of-the-art text mining tools to extract 344 interpretable features from a large corpus of over 200,000 journal articles in economics. We then estimate beta regression models to investigate the relationship between these predictors and a cross-sectionally standardized version of SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) in multiple topically homogeneous clusters. In so doing, we also reinvestigate the bafflegab theory, according to which more prestigious research papers tend to be less readable, in a methodologically novel way. Our results show the consistently most informative predictors to be associated with the length of the paper, the span of coreference chains in its full text, the deployment of a personal and moderately informal writing style, the ``density'' of the article in terms of sentences per page, international and institutional collaboration in research teams and the references cited in the paper. Moreover, we identify various linguistic intricacies that matter in the association between readability and scientific prestige, which suggest this relationship to be more complicated than previously assumed.},

During recent years, Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) providers, such as Coursera or edX, are reporting millions of new users signing up on their platforms. Though online review systems are standard among many verticals, no standardized or fully decentralized review systems exist in the MOOC ecosystem. In this vein, we believe that there is an opportunity to leverage available open MOOC reviews in order to build simpler and more transparent reviewing systems, allowing users to really identify the best courses out there. Specifically, in our research we analyze 2.4 million reviews (which is the largest MOOC reviews dataset used until now) from five different platforms in order to determine the following: (1) if the numeric ratings provide discriminant information to learners, (2) if NLP-driven sentiment analysis on textual reviews could provide valuable information to learners, (3) if we can leverage NLP-driven topic finding techniques to infer themes that could be important for learners, and (4) if we can use these models to effectively characterize MOOCs based on the open reviews. Results show that numeric ratings are clearly biased (63% of them are 5-star ratings), and the topic modeling reveals some interesting topics related with course advertisements, the real applicability, or the difficulty of the different courses.},

	abstract = {The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), created by congress in 2011, receives and processes consumer complaints pertaining to various financial services. Every complaint narrative provides insight into problems that consumers are experiencing. With increasing number of the CFPB complaint narratives, manual review of these documents by human experts is not feasible. This requires an intelligent system to analyze narratives automatically and provide insightful knowledge to the experts. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to analyze the CFPB consumer complaints. The proposed approach aims to extract latent topics in the CFPB complaint narratives, and explores their associated trends over time. The time trends will then be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the CFPB regulations and expectations on financial institutions in creating a consumer oriented culture. The technology-human partnership between the proposed approach and the CFPB experts could certainly improve consumer experience by providing more efficient and effective investigations of consumer complaint narratives.},

@article{zhang_2019_learning_document_representation_via_topic_enhanced_lstm_model,
	abstract = {Document representation plays an important role in the fields of text mining, natural language processing, and information retrieval. Traditional approaches to document representation may suffer from the disregard of the correlations or order of words in a document, due to unrealistic assumption of word independence or exchangeability. Recently, long--short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural networks have been shown effective in preserving local contextual sequential patterns of words in a document, but using the LSTM model alone may not be adequate to capture global topical semantics for learning document representation. In this work, we propose a new topic-enhanced LSTM model to deal with the document representation problem. We first employ an attention-based LSTM model to generate hidden representation of word sequence in a given document. Then, we introduce a latent topic modeling layer with similarity constraint on the local hidden representation, and build a tree-structured LSTM on top of the topic layer for generating semantic representation of the document. We evaluate our model in typical text mining applications, i.e., document classification, topic detection, information retrieval, and document clustering. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the benefit of our innovations over state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

@article{lebena_2022_preliminary_exploration_of_topic_modelling_representations_for_electronic_health_records_coding_according_to_the_international_classification_of_diseases_in_spanish,
	abstract = {In this work, we cope with the classification of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in Spanish according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). We employ Topic Models representing each document as a probabilistic distribution over topics, offering a low-dimensional representation of documents. The trend is to turn to an embedding text representation, but these approaches require large amounts of textual data. We found Topic Models as a suitable alternative approach to deal with the few resources available for Spanish clinical text mining. Besides, they are interpretable and aid the explainability in artificial intelligence (XAI). We explored two different methods, known as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Partially Labelled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (PLDA), the supervised approach of the former. We assessed the results attained in Spanish with an analogous task in English as a reference. Evaluation methods were applied directly to the representation, with metrics to determine topic coherence and the relationship between topics and ICD labels. We learned that PLDA was able to discover topics associated with the ICD. This finding means that this representation itself can reveal ICD codes previous to classification. Also, this representation was used as predictive features to feed a conventional classifier to show their competence in a downstream task. We conclude that in a context with a lack of big data availability, PLDA emerges as a versatile candidate, able to offer a competitive representation of EHRs. While other works are primarily concerned with supervised categorization and do not pay attention to the representation, LDA and PLDA offer an interpretable approach that can be associated with ICDs. Moreover, compared with those that employ LDA, we demonstrate how its' supervised version, PLDA, can be more intuitive as it shows a closer relation with the ICDs.},

	abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have been widely disseminated due to the arrival of Web 2.0. However, the growth of MOOCs brings some difficulties for students in choosing suitable courses in these ecosystems. In recent years, some recommendation systems emerged to solve this problem but remain limited since they do not identify the student's prior knowledge broadly or the student's goals. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes the Fragmented Recommendation for MOOCs Ecosystems (FReME), a recommendation system to suggest parts of courses from multiple providers (i.e., Khan Academy, Udemy, and edX). FReME is based on the student profile and on the MOOCs ecosystems perspective to balance the ecological environment and strengthen interactions. Moreover, we differ from the current recommendation systems since our method identifies and reduces the students' knowledge gap optimizing the learning process. Experimental results conducted with a dataset integrating 3 MOOCs providers and 19 students demonstrated that the implemented techniques are more consistent than other approaches. Finally, it was verified through precision, utility, novelty, and confidence that our recommendations are 62,24% accurate, 68.89% useful, 72.81% reliable, and present new content in 99.12% of cases. These results validate that FReME supports students in reducing their knowledge gap.},

Although recognition works on mathematical expressions have been explored for four decades, the current literature and trends are varied and frequently influenced by distinct emerging methods and technology. This situation instigates the necessity of an organized review to provide heedful insight into research trends and patterns currently prevailing in the domain of mathematical expression recognition (MER).
Objective
To identify and associate (semantic mapping) the leading research zones, core research areas, and research trends steering in the MER domain. Identifying prominent recognition models based on extracted research areas. To develop the development chart from extracted research trends for directing the future works in this direction.
Method
A manual and automatic search has been performed across the reputed digital libraries for corpus formation. The formulated corpus is used for topic modeling, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation is deployed for information modeling for achieving defined objectives.
Result
The corpus of 325 research papers published from 1967 to 2021 has been processed using LDA. The five major research areas and ten research trends are identified. Leading research area is ``Segmentation and Classification Procedures'', and the trend with the highest related publications is ``Contextual and Graph-based recognition''. ``Attention and Deep Networks'' has emerged as the newborn trend, and the identified newborn, young, and matured trends impetrate more exploration from the MER research community.},

	abstract = {Due to the huge size of the data accumulated on microblogging sites, recently, two fundamental questions have become very popular: 1) What percentage of this accumulated data has positive or negative sentiment polarity? 2) How is the distribution of this accumulated data on different topics? Inspired by these motivated necessities, this paper presents several different algorithms which are based on the Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) in order to handle previously mentioned two fundamentals tasks: sentiment polarity detection task and topic-based text classification task. These algorithms are the Label Propagated- Relevance Frequency Classifier (LP-RFC) and LP-Abstract Frequency Classifier (LP-AFC). These algorithms can be defined as new semantic smoothing classifiers, which take advantage of the semantic connections among terms in the label propagation phase of the LPA. Additionally, another classifier, namely LP-ComRFC+AFC, was built. LP-ComRFC+AFC is actually a weighted summation classifier of the individual LP-RFC and LP-AFC. Furthermore, considering the shortage of labeled data in real-world scenarios, a semi-supervised version of LP-RFC and LP-AFC, namely ``Merging Unlabeled and Labeled Instances with Semantic Values of Terms'' (MULIS), was designed and implemented. For the experiments of the sentiment polarity detection task, three different datasets were use and for the experiments of topic-based text classification task, a self-collected tweet dataset was use. According to the experimental results, the suggested algorithms, and their composite form, LP-ComRFC+AFC, generated higher F1 scores than all of the baseline algorithms at nearly all of the training splits on the datasets.},

We draw from the innovation and entrepreneurship literature and provide an empirical basis for the widely accepted attribute mapping framework, which delineates between desirable product attributes that firms may want to capitalize upon and undesirable attributes that they may need to remedy. Based on a large sample of reviews in the countertop appliances industry, we demonstrate the performance of our technique, which offers statistically significant improvements relative to existing methods. We validate the usefulness of our technique by asking senior managers at a large manufacturing firm to rate a selection of online reviews, and we show that the selected attribute types are more useful than alternative reviews. Our results offer insight in how firms may use online reviews to harness vital consumer feedback.},

@article{effrosynidis_2022_the_climate_change_twitter_dataset,
	abstract = {This work creates and makes publicly available the most comprehensive dataset to date regarding climate change and human opinions via Twitter. It has the heftiest temporal coverage, spanning over 13 years, includes over 15 million tweets spatially distributed across the world, and provides the geolocation of most tweets. Seven dimensions of information are tied to each tweet, namely geolocation, user gender, climate change stance and sentiment, aggressiveness, deviations from historic temperature, and topic modeling, while accompanied by environmental disaster events information. These dimensions were produced by testing and evaluating a plethora of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and methods, both supervised and unsupervised, including BERT, RNN, LSTM, CNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, VADER, Textblob, Flair, and LDA.},

@article{xu_2020_topic_linked_innovation_paths_in_science_and_technology,
	abstract = {In the modern world, science and technology jointly determine the evolutionary path of scientific innovation, with an increasingly close relationship between them. Therefore, it is important to study the identification method of the innovation path, based on the linkage of topics in science and technology. This study focuses on connected topics utilizing bibliometric analysis, thereby exploring the identification method for innovation paths based on the linkage of scientific and technological topics. The internal mechanism of knowledge dissemination and the relationship between science and technology are revealed and described in detail by measuring the linkage of knowledge units. For practical bibliometric analyses, research papers and patent literature were used to characterize scientific research and technological research to reveal the innovation path for the interaction of science and technology quantitatively, automatically, and visually. Experimental study shows that analysis of the topic-linked path of science and technology, along with the integration of multi-relationships, can effectively identify important science- and technology-related topics in a field in the evolution process, and help grasp the key points of basic research and applied research.},

@article{pablos_2018_w2vlda_almost_unsupervised_system_for_aspect_based_sentiment_analysis,
	abstract = {With the increase of online customer opinions in specialised websites and social networks, automatic systems to help organise and classify customer reviews by domain-specific aspect categories and sentiment polarity are more needed than ever. Supervised approaches for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis achieve good results for the domain and language they are trained on, but manually labelling data to train supervised systems for all domains and languages is very costly and time consuming. In this work, we describe W2VLDA, an almost unsupervised system based on topic modelling that, combined with some other unsupervised methods and a minimal configuration step, performs aspect category classification, aspect-term and opinion-word separation and sentiment polarity classification for any given domain and language. We evaluate its domain aspect and sentiment classification performance in the multilingual SemEval 2016 task 5 (ABSA) dataset. We show competitive results for several domains (hotels, restaurants, electronic devices) and languages (English, Spanish, French and Dutch).},
