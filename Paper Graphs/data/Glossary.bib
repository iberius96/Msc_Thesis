@article{kim_2020_transparency_and_accountability_in_ai_decision_support_explaining_and_visualizing_convolutional_neural_networks_for_text_information,
	abstract = {Proliferating applications of deep learning, along with the prevalence of large-scale text datasets, have revolutionized the natural language processing (NLP) field, thereby driving the recent explosive growth. Nevertheless, it is argued that state-of-the-art studies focus excessively on producing quantitative performances superior to existing models, by playing ``the Kaggle game.'' Hence, the field requires more effort in solving new problems and proposing novel approaches and architectures. We claim that one of the promising and constructive efforts would be to design transparent and accountable artificial intelligence (AI) systems for text analytics. By doing so, we can enhance the applicability and problem-solving capacity of the system for real-world decision support. It is widely accepted that deep learning models demonstrate remarkable performances compared to existing algorithms. However, they are often criticized for being less interpretable, i.e., the ``black box.'' In such cases, users tend to hesitate to utilize them for decision-making, especially in crucial tasks. Such complexity obstructs transparency and accountability of the overall system, potentially debilitating the deployment of decision support systems powered by AI. Furthermore, recent regulations are emphasizing fairness and transparency in algorithms to a greater extent, turning explanations more compulsory than voluntary. Thus, to enhance the transparency and accountability of the decision support system and preserve the capacity to model complex text data at the same time, we propose the Explaining and Visualizing Convolutional neural networks for Text information (EVCT) framework. By adopting and ameliorating cutting-edge methods in NLP and image processing, the EVCT framework provides a human-interpretable solution to the problem of text classification while minimizing information loss. Experimental results with large-scale, real-world datasets show that EVCT performs comparably to benchmark models, including widely used deep learning models. In addition, we provide instances of human-interpretable and relevant visualized explanations obtained from applying EVCT to the dataset and possible applications for real-world decision support.},

@article{goldberg_2018_a_tabu_search_heuristic_for_smoke_term_curation_in_safety_defect_discovery,
	abstract = {The ability to detect and rapidly respond to the presence of safety defects is vital to firms and to regulatory agencies. In this paper, we employ a text mining methodology to generate industry-specific ``smoke terms'' for identifying these defects in the countertop appliances and over-the-counter medicine industries. Building upon prior work, we propose several methodological improvements to enhance the precision of our industry-specific terms. First, we replace the subjective manual curation of these terms with an automated Tabu search algorithm, which provides a statistically significant improvement over a sample of human-curated lists. Contrary to the assumptions of prior work, we find that shorter, targeted smoke term lists produce superior precision. Second, we incorporate non-textual review features to enhance the performance of these smoke term lists. In total, we find greater than a twofold improvement over typical human-curated lists. As safety surveillance is vital across industries, our method has great potential to assist firms and regulatory agencies in identifying and responding quickly to safety defects.},

@article{law_2017_automated_defect_discovery_for_dishwasher_appliances_from_online_consumer_reviews,
	abstract = {Product defects can have a devastating impact on a firm's sales and reputation, especially in the era of social media. The early detection of defects could not only protect consumers from financial losses, but could also mitigate financial damage to the manufacturer. Previous work in automated defect discovery has had success in the automotive, consumer electronics, and toy industries, but so far there has been no application to home appliances. In this study, we extend the text analytic framework conceived in earlier work to the discovery of underperformance in large home appliances, specifically dishwashers. We find that generic cross-domain sentiment techniques can be strongly complemented by domain-specific ``smoke'' and ``sparkle'' term lists that are highly correlated with potential defects. These findings can be highly beneficial to improving dishwasher appliance quality management methods.},

@article{mummalaneni_2018_social_media_analytics_for_quality_surveillance_and_safety_hazard_detection_in_baby_cribs,
	abstract = {Defects in baby cribs and related products can cause injuries and deaths, and they cost manufacturers and distributors millions of dollars in fines and legal fees and even more in losses of sales and brand image. There has been no prior research regarding automated defect discovery from online reviews of baby cribs, and prior safety defect discovery methods designed and calibrated for other industries must be adapted. We aim to determine which words and phrases are indicators of defects in online reviews and whether sentiment analysis is sufficient for automated defect discovery in the baby crib industry. We find that sentiment analysis serves as a useful tool for automated defect discovery in the baby crib industry and create a supplementary set of ``smoke terms'' that are strong indicators of safety defects in online reviews of baby cribs. Using our term-based scoring method, we observe a 59% improvement in precision and a 60% improvement in recall when compared to the top-performing prior sentiment method. Our findings provide actionable insights into how analysis of online reviews and other social media can improve baby crib quality management techniques. These terms can be used with immediate effect to monitor and more rapidly identify defects and rectify them before injuries or deaths occur.},

@article{pessach_2020_employees_recruitment_a_prescriptive_analytics_approach_via_machine_learning_and_mathematical_programming,
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a comprehensive analytics framework that can serve as a decision support tool for HR recruiters in real-world settings in order to improve hiring and placement decisions. The proposed framework follows two main phases: a local prediction scheme for recruitments' success at the level of a single job placement, and a mathematical model that provides a global recruitment optimization scheme for the organization, taking into account multilevel considerations. In the first phase, a key property of the proposed prediction approach is the interpretability of the machine learning (ML) model, which in this case is obtained by applying the Variable-Order Bayesian Network (VOBN) model to the recruitment data. Specifically, we used a uniquely large dataset that contains recruitment records of hundreds of thousands of employees over a decade and represents a wide range of heterogeneous populations. Our analysis shows that the VOBN model can provide both high accuracy and interpretability insights to HR professionals. Moreover, we show that using the interpretable VOBN can lead to unexpected and sometimes counter-intuitive insights that might otherwise be overlooked by recruiters who rely on conventional methods. We demonstrate that it is feasible to predict the successful placement of a candidate in a specific position at a pre-hire stage and utilize predictions to devise a global optimization model. Our results show that in comparison to actual recruitment decisions, the devised framework is capable of providing a balanced recruitment plan while improving both diversity and recruitment success rates, despite the inherent trade-off between the two.},

Traditionally, customers are not very much involved in product innovation processes. With the technology of Web 2.0, online users are enabled and motivated to provide reviews and discussions about product features and use experiences. User generated product reviews have been found to have a word-of-mouth effect as a new element of marketing communication. However, their implication on improving product innovation cycles have not been studied before. Guided by a persuasion theory, we extracted the central and peripheral persuasion cues from user generated reviews and examined their impact on mobile app developers' product innovation decisions. Using data collected from the Google App store, our empirical study shows that long and easy-to-read user reviews with mildly negative reviews can increase the likelihood of a future mobile app update. Our findings highlight the need for researchers to explore user generated reviews in the context of customer-centered product innovation.},

@article{sachan_2020_an_explainable_ai_decision_support_system_to_automate_loan_underwriting,
	abstract = {Widespread adoption of automated decision making by artificial intelligence (AI) is witnessed due to specular advances in computation power and improvements in optimization algorithms especially in machine learning (ML). Complex ML models provide good prediction accuracy; however, the opacity of ML models does not provide sufficient assurance for their adoption in the automation of lending decisions. This paper presents an explainable AI decision-support-system to automate the loan underwriting process by belief-rule-base (BRB). This system can accommodate human knowledge and can also learn from historical data by supervised learning. The hierarchical structure of BRB can accommodates factual and heuristic rules. The system can explain the chain of events leading to a decision for a loan application by the importance of an activated rule and the contribution of antecedent attributes in the rule. A business case study on automation of mortgage underwriting is demonstrated to show that the BRB system can provide a good trade-off between accuracy and explainability. The textual explanation produced by the activation of rules could be used as a reason for denial of a loan. The decision-making process for an application can be comprehended by the significance of rules in providing the decision and contribution of its antecedent attributes.},

	abstract = {Consumer recommendations of products and services are important performance indicators for organizations to gain feedback on their offerings. Furthermore, they are important for prospective customers to learn from prior consumer experiences. In this study, we focus on user-generated content, in particular online reviews, to investigate which service aspects are evaluated by consumers and how these factors explain a consumer's recommendation. Further, we investigate how recommendations can be predicted automatically based on such user-driven responses. We disentangle the recommendation decision by performing explanatory and predictive analyses focusing on a sample of airline reviews. We identify core and augmented service aspects expressed in the online review. We then show that service aspect-specific sentiment indicators drive the decision to recommend an airline and that these factors can be incorporated in a predictive model using data mining techniques. We also find that the business model of an airline being reviewed, whether low cost or full service, is also an applicable consideration. Our results are highly relevant for practitioners to analyze and act on consumer feedback in a prompt manner, along with the ability of gaining a deeper understanding of the service from multiple aspects. Also, potential travelers can benefit from this approach by getting an aggregated view on service quality.},

@article{srinivas_2019_topic_based_knowledge_mining_of_online_student_reviews_for_strategic_planning_in_universities,
	abstract = {Over the past few years, studies observe a continuous decline in university enrollment and retention rates resulting in millions of dollars in lost revenue. Past research shows that 95% of the students rely heavily on the positive word-of-mouth to select a college. Especially, with the advent of Web 2.0 tools, students are able to make informed decisions due to increased awareness through online reviews. Academic institutions can also leverage this information to understand and improve their students' perception. The objective of this paper is to identify the current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of a university by analyzing online student reviews using text analytics. Our proposed approach integrates four different techniques: topic modeling, sentiment analysis, root cause and SWOT analyses. First, we introduce an ensemble of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (E-LDA) topic models to automatically identify the key features (topics) that are predominantly discussed by students and categorize each review sentence into the most related topic. We then detect the opinion associated with each sentence (positive, negative and neutral) using sentiment analysis. Finally, a topic-based opinion summary (TOS) for a university is established to identify its strengths and weaknesses from the students' perspective, and the opportunities and threats are determined by analyzing the TOS of the competitors (or other similar institutions). A case study is used to illustrate the feasibility and application of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed method provides an efficient and economic performance summary of a university and its competitors, and could help its leaders in recruitment and retention efforts.},

	abstract = {Online reviews contain many vital insights for quality management, but the volume of content makes identifying defect-related discussion difficult. This paper critically assesses multiple approaches for detecting defect-related discussion, ranging from out-of-the-box sentiment analyses to supervised and unsupervised machine-learned defect terms. We examine reviews from 25 product and service categories to assess each method's performance. We examine each approach across the broad cross-section of categories as well as when tailored to a singular category of study. Surprisingly, we found that negative sentiment was often a poor predictor of defect-related discussion. Terms generated with unsupervised topic modeling tended to correspond to generic product discussions rather than defect-related discussion. Supervised learning techniques outperformed the other text analytic techniques in our cross-category analysis, and they were especially effective when confined to a single category of study. Our work suggests a need for category-specific text analyses to take full advantage of consumer-driven quality intelligence.},

The paper examines the www.zol.com.cnwebsite as a source of information and Huawei Mate phones as a research target, processes the data of consumers'online reviews on three types of Huawei Mate phones, discusses the correlations between online reviews and phone improvement, and proposes some suggestions for future product improvement. This empirical study shows that the correlation between the change in the degree of feature satisfaction and phone improvement is strong; the correlation between the change in the degree of feature satisfaction and product improvement is stronger than that between the change in the degree of feature attention and product improvement. Enterprises can determine the direction and contents of phone improvement based on information from reviews on its preceding phone model. This study can help enterprises master market requirements, understand consumers'behaviour and improve the quality and efficiency of product innovation.},

@article{zhang_2021_mining_product_innovation_ideas_from_online_reviews,
	abstract = {The importance of online customer reviews to product innovation has been well-recognized in prior literature. Mining online reviews has received extensive attention and efforts. Most existing research on mining online reviews focus on issues such as the impact of reviews on sales, helpfulness of reviews, and customers' participation in reviews. Few research studies, however, seek to identify and extract innovation ideas for products from online reviews. This type of information is particularly important for product functionality improvement and new feature development from a manufacturer's perspective. Mining product innovation ideas allows a manufacturer to proactively review customer opinion and unlock insights about new functionality and features that the market expects, in order to gain a competitive advantage. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach to identify sentences that contain innovation ideas from online reviews. Specifically, we develop a novel ensemble embedding method to generate semantic and contextual representations of the words in review sentences. The resultant representations in each sentence are then used in a long short-term memory (LSTM) model for innovation-sentence identification. Moreover, we adopt a focal loss function in our model to address the class imbalance problem. We validate our approach with a dataset of 10,000 customer reviews from Amazon. Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.91 and an F1 score of 0.89, outperforming a set of state-of-the-art baseline models in the comparison. Our approach can be extended and applied to many other information extraction tasks.},

It presents a framework of application areas, and how they help the understanding of targeting and scoping specific areas for sustainable improvement. Empirical evidence demonstrates the application of BD in practice and tests the framework. Design/methodology/approach An exploratory approach is adopted to the secondary research which examines vendors'offerings. The empirical research used the case study method. Findings The findings indicate that there is opportunity to create sustainable competitive advantage through the application of BD. However there are social, technological and human consequences that are only now beginning to emerge which need to be addressed if true long-term advantage is to be achieved. Research limitations/implications The research develops a framework and tests it only in two dimensions. This should be expanded. The vendor analysis limitations lie within the nature of the information available and the difficulties in mitigating against bias. Practical implications The suggested framework can help academics and managers to identify areas of opportunity to do so, setting new levels of performance and new agendas for business. Originality/value This work contributes to service operations management, building on Kranzberg (1986) and the impact of technology and on Fosso Wamba et al. (2015) by developing a systems application framework to further understanding of BD from a practical perspective to extend their research taxonomy insights. The case studies demonstrate how the use of BD enhances operational performance.},

@article{ramanathan_2017_role_of_social_media_in_retail_network_operations_and_marketing_to_enhance_customer_satisfaction,
	abstract = {Purpose The technology evolution compels retail networks to introduce unique business models to retain customers and to gain a competitive advantage. Customer reviews available through social media need to be taken into account by retail networks to design a model with unique service operations and marketing approaches that will improve loyalty by adding value to customers. Furthermore, the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer spending behaviour is very weak and needs further investigation. Hence the purpose of this paper is to understand how retail network leverage the potential of social media reviews along with unique service operations to satisfy customers. The study analyses the nexus of: a brand, promotional offers, service operations; and their interaction through social media reviews on customer satisfaction levels. Design/methodology/approach The authors develop a conceptual model for the social media era. The authors combine the idea of loyalty- and value-based models of Chatterjee (2013). The authors employed a survey questionnaire method to elicit opinions of retail customer satisfaction based on social media reviews, service operations and marketing efforts. The authors derive measures of the model from existing literature and expert opinion. Findings Social media reviews dramatically impact upon customer satisfaction. Similarly the empirical analysis identifies the significant and positive role played by service operations in customer satisfaction levels. Interestingly the authors did not find unequivocal support for brand satisfaction impacting on customer satisfaction. However, when promotions interact well with service operations, the level of customer satisfaction is significantly affected. Similarly the authors did not observe a positive outcome when there is an interaction between promotion and social media reviews. After reading the reviews, some potential buyers make a visit to store before making final decisions and surprisingly, promotional effects do not change their mind set. Practical implications Research findings confirm the importance of social media reviews, marketing and interaction between promotion and service operations enabling retail networks to build loyalty and value-based models. Based on customer behaviour, the study suggests a need to consider operational efficiencies when promoting sales; through careful planning, customer satisfaction and profitability levels can be increased. This sends a strong message to the retail network to defend their position within a very competitive business market. Originality/value The empirical evidence based on customer experience would be helpful for companies in integrating their operations and marketing efforts enabling them to convert different segment of customers such as ``free riders (higher satisfaction and low profitability)''and ``vulnerable customers (low satisfaction and higher profitability)''into ``star customers (higher satisfaction and high profitability)''. Through a considered approach: combining social media reviews, marketing and operations, businesses will be better-placed to survive in the ultra-competitive social media-influenced era.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, customers not only shop online---they also post reviews on social media. This user-generated content (UGC) can be useful to understand customers' shopping experiences and influence future customers' purchase intentions. Therefore, business intelligence and analytics are increasingly being advocated as a way to analyze customers' UGC in social media and support firms' marketing activities. However, because of its open structure, UGC such as customer reviews can be difficult to analyze, and firms find it challenging to harness UGC. To fill this gap, this study aims to examine customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction toward attributes of hotel products and services based on online customer textual reviews. Using a text mining approach, latent semantic analysis (LSA), we identify the key attributes driving customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction toward hotel products and service attributes. Additionally, using a regression approach, we examine the effects of travel purposes, hotel types, star level, and editor recommendations on customers' perceptions of attributes of hotel products and services. This study bridges customer online textual reviews with customers' perceptions to help business managers better understand customers' needs through UGC.},

@article{wiener_2018_omnichannel_businesses_in_the_publishing_and_retailing_industries_synergies_and_tensions_between_coexisting_online_and_offline_business_models,
	abstract = {Since the emergence of the Internet, many brick-and-mortar companies from various industries have established an online business model (BM) alongside their traditional offline BM. Despite the increasing coexistence of online and offline BMs within a single company, however, most prior research has focused on studying online and offline BMs in isolation. Consequently, still little is known about the interplay of dual BMs in omnichannel businesses. We address this research gap through an empirical investigation of the synergies and tensions that arise from coexisting online and offline BMs as well as the factors that influence the emergence of such synergies and tensions. Drawing on a series of six case studies with three publishers and three retailers, we identify an extended set of BM synergies and tensions, which concern all major BM dimensions. In addition, our case analysis reveals that companies are able to exploit different synergies, but also face different tensions between their online and offline BMs. The observed differences can be traced back to the level of online-offline BM integration, online-offline product distinctions (e.g., in terms of product content and publication cycles), and general organization context factors (e.g., offline brand strength, organization structure). By uncovering both the benefits and the complexity of running online and offline BMs in parallel, our study contributes to the theoretical understanding of omnichannel businesses, and provides managers with practical guidance on how to design, integrate, and manage their dual BMs successfully.},

To take stock of academic research that contributes to the big data revolution, this paper tracks scholarly work's perspectives on big data in the management domain over the past decade. We identify key themes emerging in management studies and develop an integrated framework to link the multiple streams of research in fields of organisation, operations, marketing, information management and other relevant areas. Our analysis uncovers a growing awareness of big data's business values and managerial changes led by data-driven approach. Stemming from the review is the suggestion for research that both structured and unstructured big data should be harnessed to advance understanding of big data value in informing organisational decisions and enhancing firm competitiveness. To discover the full value, firms need to formulate and implement a data-driven strategy. In light of these, the study identifies and outlines the implications and directions for future research.},

It has changed the way how online community interacts and somehow has led to a new trend of engagement for online retailers especially on microblogging websites such as Twitter. In this study, we investigated the impact of online retailers' engagement with the online brand communities on users' perception of brand image and service. Firstly, we analysed the overall sentiment trends of different brands and the patterns of engagement between companies and customers using the collected tweets posted on a popular social media platform, Twitter. Then, we studied how different types of engagements affect customer sentiments. Our analysis shows that engagement has an effect on sentiments that associate with brand image, perception and customer service of the online retailers. Our findings indicate that the level, length, type and attitude of retailers' engagement with social media users have a significant impact on their sentiments. Based on our results, we derived several important managerial and practical implications.},

@article{bradlow_2017_the_role_of_big_data_and_predictive_analytics_in_retailing,
	abstract = {The paper examines the opportunities in and possibilities arising from big data in retailing, particularly along five major data dimensions---data pertaining to customers, products, time, (geo-spatial) location and channel. Much of the increase in data quality and application possibilities comes from a mix of new data sources, a smart application of statistical tools and domain knowledge combined with theoretical insights. The importance of theory in guiding any systematic search for answers to retailing questions, as well as for streamlining analysis remains undiminished, even as the role of big data and predictive analytics in retailing is set to rise in importance, aided by newer sources of data and large-scale correlational techniques. The Statistical issues discussed include a particular focus on the relevance and uses of Bayesian analysis techniques (data borrowing, updating, augmentation and hierarchical modeling), predictive analytics using big data and a field experiment, all in a retailing context. Finally, the ethical and privacy issues that may arise from the use of big data in retailing are also highlighted.},

Using a large set of news releases, we document a strong negative relationship between the sentiment of firm-specific news and CDS spreads. More importantly, consistent with the role of public news in reducing information asymmetry, we find evidence that the relation between news sentiment and CDS spreads is stronger for firms with higher information asymmetry. Furthermore, the relation is stronger for news with negative sentiment and during the 2008 financial crisis. Our results are robust to alternative sentiment measures.},

@article{kiesel_2017_cds_spreads_as_an_independent_measure_of_credit_risk,
	abstract = {Purpose The creditworthiness of corporates is most visible in credit ratings. This paper aims to present an alternative credit rating measure independently of credit rating agencies. The credit rating score (CRS) is based on the credit default swap (CDS) market trading. Design/methodology/approach A CRS is developed which is a linear function of logarithmized CDS spreads. This new CRS is the first one that is completely independent of the rating agency. The estimated ratings are compared with ratings provided by Fitch Ratings for 310 European and US non-financial corporates. Findings The empirical analysis shows that logarithmized CDS spreads and issuer credit ratings by agencies have a linear relationship. The new CRS provides market participants with an alternative risk assessment, which is solely based on market factors, and does not rely on credit rating analysts. The results indicate that our CRS is able to anticipate agency ratings in advance. Moreover, the analysis shows that the trading volume has only a limited influence in the anticipation of rating changes. Originality/value This study shows a new approach to measure the creditworthiness of firms by analyzing CDS spreads. This is highly relevant for regulation, firm monitoring and investors.},

	abstract = {We use machine learning methods to create a comprehensive measure of credit risk based on qualitative information disclosed in conference calls and in management's discussion and analysis section of the 10-K. In out-of-sample tests, we find that our measure improves the ability to predict credit events (bankruptcies, interest spreads, and credit rating downgrades), relative to credit risk measures developed by prior research (e.g., z-score). We also find our measure based on conference calls explains within-firm variation in future credit events; however, we find little evidence that the measures of credit risk developed by prior research explain within-firm variation in credit risk. Our measure has utility for both academics and practitioners, as the majority of firms do not have readily available measures of credit risk, such as actively-traded CDS or credit ratings. Our study also adds to the growing body of research using machine-learning methods to gather information from conference calls and MD\&A to explain key outcomes.},

The results indicate that the cognitive trust-identity attachment building mechanism is more effective than affective trust-bond attachment depending on the emotional distance between the users and hosts. Finally, this paper provides scholars with theoretical enhancement on the trust and attachment literature and recommends managers of the sharing businesses to enrich users' trust-attachment toward the firm and the service provider that has a strong influence on users' behavioral intention to use.},

	abstract = {Remarketing and reselling remanufactured electronic products is one of the effective and sustainable approaches to deal with the rapidly increasing e-waste. Studying customer purchasing intention and behavior toward remanufactured products can help businesses better understand customers' needs and improve closed-loop supply chain performance. Via an empirical study based on new, manufacturer remanufactured, seller remanufactured, and used products transaction data from eBay, one of the most popular online markets, this paper investigates the impact of e-service offerings in four online transaction phases (i.e., information, agreement, fulfillment, and after-sales phase) on customer purchasing intention toward remanufactured products in both auctions and fixed price transactions. The results indicate that e-service offerings in the information phase are most influential on customers' willingness to pay (WTP) in both types of transactions. In addition, we find e-services in auctions has higher positive influence on customers' WTP compared to fixed price transactions, as demonstrated by the results that e-services in all four online transaction phases significantly influence customers' WTP in auctions, but not in fixed price transactions. The results also show that in both types of transactions, customers are willing to pay a premium for seller remanufactured products, and even more for manufacturer remanufactured products and new products, compared with used products. Furthermore, we discuss the managerial implications on customer online purchasing intention toward remanufactured products and online sellers' sales strategies.},

LSA identified accidents with track maintenance equipment as a topic. Both text mining models identified accidents with tractor-trailer highway trucks as a particular problem at grade crossings. It was found that the use of the two techniques was complementary, with more accident topics identified than with the use of a single method.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years the sharing economy has been changing the way that people share and conduct transactions in digital spaces. This research phenomenon has drawn scholars from a large number of disparate fields and disciplines into an emerging research area. Given the variety of perspectives represented, there is a great need to collect and connect what has been done, and to identify some common themes, which will serve as a basis for future discussions on the crucial roles played by digital platforms in the sharing economy. Drawing on a collection of 435 publications on the sharing economy and related terms, we identify some trends in the literature and underlying research interests. Specifically, we organize the literature around the concept of platform mediation, and draw a set of essential affordances of sharing economy technologies from the reviewed literature. We present the notion of platform centralization/decentralization as an effective organizing principle for the variety of perspectives on the sharing economy, and also evaluate scholars' treatment of technology itself. Finally, we identify important gaps in the existing literature on the relationship between digital platforms and sharing economy, and provide directions for future investigations.},

	abstract = {Airbnb is widely recognized as a disruptive innovation in the tourism industry. While separate studies have examined various factors affecting consumers' adoption of Airbnb, the literature has largely focused on a handful of factors in isolation. Adopting a sequential mixed-methods approach, this study proposes a comprehensive conceptual model integrating the literature and findings of a qualitative study and subsequently tests the model via a national survey. The results suggest that, for motivations, price value, enjoyment, and home benefits significantly explain overall attitude toward Airbnb. As for constraints, distrust is the only factor that significantly predicts overall attitude, while insecurity is directly related to behavioral intentions. Overall attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms, such as social influence and trend affinity, predict behavioral intentions. This study contributes to the literature by simultaneously examining the predictive power of both motivations and constraints of Airbnb consumers in explaining overall attitude and purchase behavior.},

@article{roma_2019_sharing_economy_and_incumbents_pricing_strategy_the_impact_of_airbnb_on_the_hospitality_industry,
	abstract = {In this paper, we examine how the emergence of sharing economy platforms influences incumbents' price responses. Grounding on the literature on price reactions to new entrants and on the unique characteristics of the sharing economy, we argue that the effect of the penetration of the sharing economy on incumbents' prices is not straightforward, and actually depends on the type of incumbents as well as certain product/service offer characteristics. Indeed, relying on a large sample of hotel price offerings from the Italian market, we find that the effect of the growing relevance of the sharing economy (exemplified by Airbnb) on incumbents' prices depends on the type of incumbents (low/medium-end versus high-end hotels) as well as on the accommodation period (weekend versus weekdays), and thus on the type of consumers looking for accommodation. Specifically, low/medium-end incumbents set lower prices in geographical areas where sharing economy has a higher penetration, but this occurs only for weekend accommodation search. In contrast, high-end incumbents tend to set higher prices in geographical areas where sharing economy has a higher penetration, irrespective of the accommodation period. We discuss the important implications of our findings for incumbents, sharing economy platforms, consumers, and policy makers.},

	abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to investigate customers'perceptions of the service quality facets of Airbnb accommodation using social exchange theory as a suitable conceptual framework to explain aspects of interactivity between guests and hosts. Design/methodology/approach A self-administered questionnaire consisting of 25 accommodation-specific service quality attributes, structured according to Akbaba's (2006) measurement scale and based on the service quality hierarchical conceptualization described by Brady and Cronin (2001) and Cronin and Taylor (1992), was distributed to Airbnb international guests visiting Phuket, Thailand. The sample was chosen through a two-stage sampling process and the PLS-SEM technique was used for data analysis. Findings The results showed that convenience and assurance are critical contributors to the measurement of service quality in remote Airbnb lodgings. The findings further revealed that Airbnb guests are mainly interested in lodgings which have access to certain tourist sights, and in easily accessible information and efficient resolution of problems during their stay. The authors also found that guests greatly value the convenience and flexibility offered by Airbnb, and that they particularly appreciate the warm hospitality provided by the hosts. Finally, Airbnb guests have very low expectations of the amenities and services available at the lodgings. Research limitations/implications Airbnb is one of the most well-known examples of hospitality in the sharing economy, and results cannot be generalized to similar accommodation providers in sharing economies. Despite the appropriateness of using the measurement tool provided by Akbaba (2006), it is only one option among others for measuring service quality. Practical implications The current study can assist hosts in gaining better knowledge of guests'decision-making processes and in designing effective marketing strategies by focusing on guests'requirements in terms of service quality. The effective use of competitive strengths and the prioritization of business resources would potentially enhance guests'positive experiences at the accommodation and at the destination. Originality/value Limited numbers of studies have focused on the sharing economy and hospitality and in particular on Airbnb, and this is the first study with a focus on service quality issues in terms of Airbnb accommodation.},

Given the divide that exists, this paper proposes a phenomenographic approach to the study of destination competitiveness. Specifically, the paper argues that efforts to advance destination competitiveness should be preceded by a better understanding of how destination stakeholders is conceptualize the term. This paper explores how destination stakeholders understand destination competitiveness. The findings reveal three distinct conceptions of destination competitiveness which are hierarchically related: destination competitiveness as perception of a destination, destination competitiveness as performance, and destination competitiveness as a long-term process. Additional features of destination competitiveness are discussed including the relationship between competitiveness and attractiveness, and the dynamic nature of the competitor set. This paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for advancing the destination competitiveness concept.},

Design/methodology/approach This study proposes and tests an integrative model that synthesizes the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Prospect Theory (PT) and other Airbnb-relevant constructs (unique experience expectation, familiarity and electronic word of mouth) as the primary determinants of the Airbnb repurchase intention using an structural equation model (SEM) approach. Findings Both attitude and subject norms are significant determinants of repurchase intention, whereas perceived behavioral control is not. In addition, perceived value and risk have only direct significant impacts on attitude and, in turn, indirectly affect repurchase intention. Unique experience expectation, familiarity and electronic word of mouth exert direct and indirect influences on repurchase intention. Research limitations/implications This study extends the body of knowledge by integrating TPB and PT to investigate consumer repurchase intention in Airbnb, which provides a theoretical baseline and serves as a starting point for exploring the structural relationships of Airbnb and the sharing economy. Practical implications Airbnb should place more emphasis on value packages and authentic/unique travel experience to retain and attract more travelers. More safety/security programs should be put in place and clearly communicated to reduce the perceived risks. In addition, Airbnb may publicize positive word of mouth and introduce and expand familiarity programs to incentivize Airbnb travelers.

While research has begun to explore segmentation between users and non-users, only limited research has looked at consumer segmentation within sharing economy services. In this paper, we build on this research gap by investigating consumer segmentation within a single sharing economy platform: Airbnb. Utilizing a mixed methods approach, with both a quantitative survey and a qualitative content analysis of Airbnb listings, we compare two different types of accommodation offered on Airbnb: shared room and entire home. Our findings indicate that within a single platform, the variety between offerings can create distinct consumer segments based on both demographics and behavioral criteria. We also find that Airbnb hosts use marketing logic to target their listings towards specific consumer segments. However, there is not, in all cases, strong alignment between consumer segmentation and host targeting, leading to potentially reduced matching efficiency.},

To that end, marketers need to develop personalized messages to enhance click-through rates and online purchases. This study explores online advertising strategies for an emerging lodging concept---Airbnb. Airbnb distinguishes itself from traditional hotels by offering guests a ``feeling at home'' (e.g., belongingness) and an ``atypical place to stay'' (e.g., uniqueness). In this research, we examine the interaction effect of advertising appeal (belongingness vs. uniqueness) and an individual's sense of power (low vs. high) on click-through intention and purchase intention. The findings suggest that powerless individuals respond more favorably to the belongingness appeal, whereas powerful individuals react more positively to the uniqueness appeal. Furthermore, results from a mediation analysis reveal that self-brand connection is the underlying mechanism that explains these effects. Managerial implications for hospitality marketers are discussed.},

@article{liang_2017_be_a_superhost_the_importance_of_badge_systems_for_peer_to_peer_rental_accommodations,
	abstract = {Many sharing-economy websites like Airbnb that offer vacation-rental options for travelers are very popular. However, few studies targeting the vacation-rental industry have investigated online reviews. To narrow this gap, this study focuses mainly on the gamification design developed by Airbnb that awards a ``Superhost'' badge to hosts who receive good reviews and observes how this can impact an accommodation's review volume and ratings. All available information regarding Airbnb accommodation offered in Hong Kong was retrieved from Airbnb's website. We then constructed a negative binomial model and a Tobit model with different independent variables and controlled a set of variables relating to accommodation characteristics. The results show that an accommodation with the ``Superhost'' badge is more likely to receive reviews and higher ratings. In addition, guests are willing to spend more on ``Superhost'' accommodations. Based on our findings, we present implications for research and host practice.},

This study employed the frame analysis method to examine and understand how the sharing economy is conceptualized in the news media discourse. A total of 340 online news articles regarding the sharing economy published between 2011 and 2017 were selected from 13 U.S. news entities. Six issue-specific frames and seven interest groups were identified to organize the whole public discourse of the sharing economy. Based on the frame analysis results, an ecosystem framework was proposed to display the underlying structure of the sharing economy. The findings reveal that the sharing economy is in its early stages and the ecosystem is not yet in healthy shape. Therefore, three strategies were suggested to pave the way for sustainable development of the sharing economy ecosystem: alignment to mutual interests, collaboration for shared success, and commitment to social responsibility.},

	abstract = {This research examined how individual differences in anthropomorphic tendency (the tendency to humanize non-human agents/objects) influence how people respond to destination marketing communications. Specifically, this study examined whether individual-level anthropomorphic tendency and text-personification of destination marketing communications interact to influence destination attitude and travel intentions. Results from a study involving 210 Australian participants revealed that destination attitude and travel intentions were most favorable for people with high levels of anthropomorphic tendency and who were exposed to personified tourism messages. These findings indicate that text-personification represents a new communication tactic for tourism -- particularly for target consumers who are high in anthropomorphic tendency -- and one that can humanize the destination leading to more favorable attitudes and higher intentions to travel. This effect is mediated by positive emotions. People with high anthropomorphic tendency who are exposed to a personified advertisement feel more positive emotions, which lead to positive tourism outcomes.},

We investigate how decision support information (i.e., online reviews) can lead to information overload and decision difficulty, and ultimately affect decision satisfaction. A series of three experimental studies with subjects from a professional marketing agency examine the influence of self-determined review quantity and perceived review quality on satisfaction, as well as the mediating effects of information overload and decision difficulty. Our results show that the effect of perceived review quality on information overload is enhanced when the consumer chooses to read more reviews. Individual characteristics are also relevant; consumers' product knowledge moderates the mediating effect of decision difficulty on satisfaction. This study contributes to the literature by (1) investigating how the characteristics of decision support information affect decision process and outcome, and (2) exploring the boundary conditions wherein online reviews can empower but also overload consumers under various decision contexts.},

The success of peer-to-peer sharing platforms largely depends on the capability of platform providers to understand the users' motives for engagement. To investigate the relative importance of consumer motives for and against peer-to-peer sharing, we develop a theoretical model based on a comprehensive set of potential consumer motives. We validate our model by means of a survey among 745 participants. Our findings suggest financial benefits, trust in other users, modern lifestyle, effort expectancy, and ecological sustainability as the five most important drivers and prerequisites of platform usage intentions. Based on our findings, we suggest directions for future research on peer-based sharing and discuss implications for both theory and practice.},

In order to achieve this objective, a psychometric process was used. A qualitative approach (i.e., interview) was initially employed to identify possible halal-friendly attributes at a non-Muslim destination. Next, Churchill's (1979) procedures (exploratory factor analytic approach) and Gerbing and Anderson's (1988) guidelines (confirmatory factor analytic approach) were used. A structural equation model was proposed to test the impact of identified attributes on its subsequent outcomes. Additional asymmetrical methods were applied to investigate the combination of halal-friendly attributes and necessary conditions leading to the desired outcomes. The outcomes determined five major halal-friendly attributes which can be useful for destination marketers in South Korea to formulate a favorable destination image, elicit repeat visitation, and promote word-of-mouth behaviors.},

The purpose of this research was to investigate such impacts by determining the extent to which Airbnb is used as a hotel substitute and to examine how Airbnb guests expect their accommodations to perform relative to hotels. Together, these analyses were intended to provide empirical insight into Airbnb's status as a disruptive innovation. The study involved an online survey of over 800 tourists who had used Airbnb within the previous year. Nearly two-thirds had used Airbnb as a hotel substitute. When considering traditional hotel attributes (e.g., cleanliness and comfort), Airbnb was generally expected to outperform budget hotels/motels, underperform upscale hotels, and have mixed outcomes versus mid-range hotels, signalling some -- but not complete -- consistency with the concept of disruptive innovation. Numerous practical and theoretical implications are discussed.},

Results showed that Entertainment Services, Restaurant Services, Cleaning of General Areas and Foreign Language Knowledge of Staff had the highest influences on customer satisfaction. Penalty-reward-contrast analysis was performed for the same service dimensions to understand their asymmetric influences on customer satisfaction. Significantly different categorizations (i.e. satisfiers; dissatisfiers if absent; hybrids) were obtained for three major market segments. Entertainment Services had been the only dimension which was categorized as a `dissatisfier if absent' for all markets. Additional comparisons were made among the first-time and repeat customers, whereas Housekeeping Services were identified as the `dissatisfiers if absent' for both groups.},

Building on previous research that distinguishes non-ownership consumption programs, this article investigates the role of materialism in participation in sharing-based programs of the sharing economy cross culturally. Unlike previous research that stated that materialism is in contrast with sharing, this research shows that under certain circumstances, both in America and India, materialism will lead to greater participation in the sharing economy. However, the reason why is different for each culture. For Americans, this effect is expected to surface for programs that resemble sharing as they don't compete with ownership of products but rather encourage materialist consumers to seek out transformative and hedonic experiences that are expected to improve their self-image and well-being. For Indians, materialism will lead to participation in sharing-based programs through increased perceived utility. Managerial and theoretical implications are discussed.},

@article{choi_2019_values_of_food_leftover_sharing_platforms_in_the_sharing_economy,
	abstract = {For many food products, such as fresh vegetable and fruit, proper handling of product leftovers is critical. In recent years, food leftover sharing (FLS) platforms that can provide a means to collect the unsold food products from individual retailers and create values from them have emerged. Motivated by this real world observation, we build a single supplier multi-retailer analytical supply chain model to explore the value of this kind of FLS platform. In the decentralized supply chain setting, we prove that the presence of FLS platform is beneficial to the retailers, the supplier, the consumers and the environment. Whether it benefits the supply chain economically depends on the logistics costs (incurred from the food product leftover collection by the FLS platform). We extend the analysis to the case with a centralized supply chain and show that the FLS platform is guaranteed to help improve the environment, but the consumers and the supply chain are only benefited when the logistics costs are sufficiently small. Sensitivity analyses are conducted which show that for both centralized and decentralized supply chain settings, the FLS platform is especially helpful in enhancing social welfare when the unit food product leftover cost is higher, the unit benefit derived from reusing the food product leftovers is higher, or the unit logistics cost is lower. We further consider the case when the logistics cost with the use of platform is high, propose the use of government sponsors to help and provide the conditions under which this sponsor is well-justified with respect to social welfare enhancement.},

Design/methodology/approach This paper makes use of a qualitative online content analysis to extract Airbnb data and to analyse guest reviews and host responses posted in the context of Malta. Findings A theoretical framework is proposed revealing six distinct themes of guest--host social practices and their sub-categories, resulting in a spectrum of dimensions of value formation. Research limitations/implications This paper collects data from Airbnb properties in Malta, with more narratives posted by guests, implying a dominance of guest views on value co-creation and co-destruction. Findings might have a limited transferability beyond similar sharing economy platforms and tourist destinations. Practical/implications The paper uncovers guest--host hospitality value creation practices, providing concrete examples as to what practices lead to distinct value formation or destruction. In addressing the lack of knowledge about value creation practices in the sharing economy, strategic implications are offered to the hospitality sector to understand the distinct value propositions Airbnb offers compared to traditional accommodation types. Originality/value The paper's contribution is its theoretical framework of value practices of guests staying at Airbnb-listed accommodations, contributing to a better understanding of the distinct value propositions underlying collaborative consumption offers in the sharing economy.},

@article{akbar_2018_the_sharing_economy_and_the_future_of_the_hotel_industry_transaction_cost_theory_and_platform_economics,
	abstract = {The `sharing economy' is in the process of transforming numerous industries. Among these, the hotel sector is especially vulnerable to the strategic disruption that sharing platforms present. Companies such as Airbnb represent the epitome of this threat. This paper sets out to achieve two fundamental research objectives. First, it develops a set of exploratory research propositions based on a qualitative application of transaction cost theory (TCT) to the emergence of sharing platforms. Second, it offers specific strategic and tactical recommendations for the hotel industry based on the TCT analysis referred to above. The paper suggests that, in revising their business models to cope with the new competitive challenges posed by sharing platforms, hotel chains can leverage their superior capacity to deal with three key features of transactions drawn from TCT (frequency, uncertainty and asset specificity) and develop what this paper terms `integrated platforms'. By employing the TCT lens to understand the emergence of sharing platforms, this is the first study to systematically develop a theoretically grounded approach to understanding how transaction features impact the emergence of sharing platforms, and it hence has clear implications for numerous industries being impacted by these developments, not least the hotel industry.},

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of online shopping, online sellers are facing more sales opportunities and challenges in the highly-competitive e-commerce market. Sellers that can generate high customer cumulative ratings may experience higher demand and profits. We explore the question of how sellers can attain those high ratings. Using leading online shopping websites in China and the U.S., we collected data for 200 online sellers in both countries for each of 40 product categories (16,000 observations) pertaining to the sellers' respective customer cumulative ratings, history, price, and e-service offerings (customized website design, credit card payments/autopay, purchase security/seller communication, fast shipping, customer support, and refund opportunities). Via path analysis, we examine the extent to which online sellers' e-service offerings and characteristics influence customer cumulative ratings and demand. We find that the effects of online sellers' e-service offerings on customer cumulative ratings are moderated by product positioning (utilitarian/hedonic) and high/low perceived risk. Our evidence also suggests that high customer cumulative ratings positively influence demand. We discuss implications for customer online shopping behavior and online sellers' sales strategies.},

@article{girgin_2021_ranking_influencers_of_social_networks_by_semantic_kernels_and_sentiment_information,
	abstract = {Inspired by the importance of social media, a Social Network Opinion Leaders (SNOL) system has been proposed in this paper. The purpose of this system is to identify topic-based opinion leaders of social media. In order to accomplish this goal, several steps have been taken, such as data collection, data processing, data analysis, data classification, ranking of topic-based opinion leaders, and evaluation. The SNOL system has two main parts. In the first part, collected tweets are classified by semantic kernels for topic-based analysis. In the second part, leadership scores are given to each user in the network according to topic modeling and user modeling results. Leadership scores are then calculated with the formula generated and opinion leaders are determined for each category. Experiments are performed on data gathered from Twitter including 17,234,924 tweets from 38,727 users. The evaluation of opinion leader detection is a difficult job since there is no standard method for identifying opinion leaders. Therefore, the evaluation of the results of this study has been done using two different methods, retweet count and spread score, to prove that the suggested methodology outperforms the PageRank algorithm. The results have also been evaluated considering the user-topic sentiment correlation of the retrieved lists. Furthermore, SNOL has been compared against some opinion leader detection methods previously presented in the literature. The experimental results show that SNOL generates remarkably higher performance than the PageRank algorithm and other existing algorithms in the literature for nearly all topics and all selected top N opinion leaders.},

@article{altinel_2018_semantic_text_classification_a_survey_of_past_and_recent_advances,
	abstract = {Automatic text classification is the task of organizing documents into pre-determined classes, generally using machine learning algorithms. Generally speaking, it is one of the most important methods to organize and make use of the gigantic amounts of information that exist in unstructured textual format. Text classification is a widely studied research area of language processing and text mining. In traditional text classification, a document is represented as a bag of words where the words in other words terms are cut from their finer context i.e. their location in a sentence or in a document. Only the broader context of document is used with some type of term frequency information in the vector space. Consequently, semantics of words that can be inferred from the finer context of its location in a sentence and its relations with neighboring words are usually ignored. However, meaning of words, semantic connections between words, documents and even classes are obviously important since methods that capture semantics generally reach better classification performances. Several surveys have been published to analyze diverse approaches for the traditional text classification methods. Most of these surveys cover application of different semantic term relatedness methods in text classification up to a certain degree. However, they do not specifically target semantic text classification algorithms and their advantages over the traditional text classification. In order to fill this gap, we undertake a comprehensive discussion of semantic text classification vs. traditional text classification. This survey explores the past and recent advancements in semantic text classification and attempts to organize existing approaches under five fundamental categories; domain knowledge-based approaches, corpus-based approaches, deep learning based approaches, word/character sequence enhanced approaches and linguistic enriched approaches. Furthermore, this survey highlights the advantages of semantic text classification algorithms over the traditional text classification algorithms.},

@article{altinel_2017_instance_labeling_in_semi_supervised_learning_with_meaning_values_of_words,
	abstract = {In supervised learning systems; only labeled samples are used for building a classifier that is then used to predict the class labels of the unlabeled samples. However, obtaining labeled data is very expensive, time consuming and difficult in real-life practical situations as labeling a data set requires the effort of a human expert. On the other side, unlabeled data are often plentiful which makes it relatively inexpensive and easier to obtain. Semi-Supervised Learning methods strive to utilize this plentiful source of unlabeled examples to increase the learning capacity of the classifier particularly when amount of labeled examples are restricted. Since SSL techniques usually reach higher accuracy and require less human effort, they attract a substantial amount of attention both in practical applications and theoretical research. A novel semi-supervised methodology is offered in this study. This algorithm utilizes a new method to predict the class labels of unlabeled examples in a corpus and incorporate them into the training set to build a better classifier. The approach presented here depends on a meaning calculation, which computes the words' meaning scores in the scope of classes. Meaning computation is constructed on the Helmholtz principle and utilized to various applications in the field of text mining like feature extraction, information retrieval and document summarization. Nevertheless, according to the literature, ILBOM is the first work which uses meaning calculation in a semi-supervised way to construct a semantic smoothing kernel for Support Vector Machines (SVM). Evaluation of the proposed methodology is done by performing various experiments on standard textual datasets. ILBOM's experimental results are compared with three baseline algorithms including SVM using linear kernel which is one of the most frequently used algorithms in text classification field. Experimental results show that labeling unlabeled instances based on meaning scores of words to augment the training set is valuable, and increases the classification accuracy on previously unseen test instances significantly.},

@article{zhang_2021_the_learning_behaviours_of_dropouts_in_moocs_a_collective_attention_network_perspective,
	abstract = {Understanding the dropout phenomenon has advanced from viewing it as a sign of deficient quality to viewing it as an explicit sign of individual choice, which highlights the importance of investigating how dropouts learn in massive open online courses (MOOCs). Nevertheless, the short, limited and heterogeneous behaviours of individual dropouts create challenges for understanding how dropouts learn over time. Taking a systematic network perspective, this study used clickstream data to build a flow network model of collective attention to investigate how dropouts learn in XuetangX's Introduction to Psychology (2018 autumn). The results showed that the quantification of behavioural data presented a stereotypical image of dropouts, but the network analytics presented a rather different picture of how dropouts learn. Recognising the distinct roles of introductory learning resources could prevent dropping out and improve the accuracy of prediction models. Interestingly, the assessments embedded in the MOOCs performed a scaffolding role in guiding dropouts to learn. Thus, redesigning quizzes or examinations in open and flexible learning environments to construct a minimum cost network of collective attention is vital to making this online space cost effective for learners at risk.},

	abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have recently gained a huge users' attention on the Web. They are considered as a highly promising form of teaching from leading universities such as Stanford and Berkeley. However, users confront the problem of choosing among thousands of offered MOOCs. In such a scenario of severe ``information overload'', recommender systems can be very useful to recommend the right course to a user, since they base their operation on past user's log history. For example, Coursera recommends courses to users so that, they can acquire those skills, that are expected from their ideal job. These user's preferences are not expected to be independent from others choices, as users follow trends of similar behaviour. In this paper, we propose, xSVD++, where the ``x'' means that it is a multi-dimensional Matrix Factorization (MMF) model combined with Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithm, which exploits information from external resources (i.e., users' skills, courses' characteristics, etc.) to predict course trends and to perform rating predictions according to them. Our experimental results indicate that xSVD++ is superior over classic and non-negative matrix factorization algorithms and the state-of-the-art CMF, and SVD++ algorithms.},

	abstract = {Automatic multimedia learning resources recommendation has become an increasingly relevant problem: it allows students to discover new learning resources that match their tastes, and enables the e-learning system to target the learning resources to the right students. In this paper, we propose a content-based recommendation algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN can be used to predict the latent factors from the text information of the multimedia resources. To train the CNN, its input and output should first be solved. For its input, the language model is used. For its output, we propose the latent factor model, which is regularized by L1-norm. Furthermore, the split Bregman iteration method is introduced to solve the model. The major novelty of the proposed recommendation algorithm is that the text information is used directly to make the content-based recommendation without tagging. Experimental results on public databases in terms of quantitative assessment show significant improvements over conventional methods. In addition, the split Bregman iteration method which is introduced to solve the model can greatly improve the training efficiency.},

@article{li_2021_carm_confidence_aware_recommender_model_via_review_representation_learning_and_historical_rating_behavior_in_the_online_platforms,
	abstract = {The recommendation systems in the online platforms often suffer from the rating data sparseness and information overload issues. Previous studies on this topic often leverage review information to construct an accurate user/item latent factor. To address this issue, we propose a novel confidence-aware recommender model via review representation learning and historical rating behavior in this article. It is motived that ratings are consistent with reviews in terms of user preferences, and reviews often contain misleading comments (e.g., fake good reviews, fake bad reviews). To this end, the interaction latent factor of user and item in the framework is constructed by exploiting review information interactivity. Then, the confidence matrix, which measures the relationship between the rating outliers and misleading reviews, is employed to further improve the model accuracy and reduce the impact of misleading reviews on the model. Furthermore, the loss function is constructed by maximum a posteriori estimation theory. Finally, the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm is introduced to optimize the loss function. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets empirically demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method also further promotes the application in learning resource adaptation. The source Python code will be available upon request.},

This paper reviews implementations of NoSQL databases in order to provide an understanding of current tools and their uses. First, NoSQL databases are compared with traditional RDBMS and important concepts are explained. Only databases allowing to persist data and distribute them along different computing nodes are within the scope of this review. Moreover, NoSQL databases are divided into different types: Key-Value, Wide-Column, Document-oriented and Graph-oriented. In each case, a comparison of available databases is carried out based on their most important features.},

An example is educational video, including Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in which knowledge builds within and across courses. Conventional content-based or collaborative filtering recommendation methods do not exploit courses'sequential nature. We describe a system for video recommendation that combines topic-based video representation with sequential pattern mining of inter-topic relationships. Unsupervised topic modeling provides a scalable and domain-independent representation. We mine inter-topic relationships from manually constructed syllabi that instructors provide to guide students through their courses. This approach also allows the inclusion of multi-video sequences among the recommendation results. Integrating the resulting sequential information with content-level similarity provides relevant as well as diversified recommendations. Quantitative evaluation indicates that the proposed system, SeqSense, recommends fewer redundant videos than baseline methods, and instead emphasizes results consistent with mined topic transitions.},

To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes the use of a Linked Courses structure to provide support to students. In this proposal, before starting a course, the background gaps of each student are identified and a personalized set of support courses is recommended to help him.

In the scenarios of the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) ecosystems, these recommenders mainly support students in choosing the best courses from the platforms. However, the expansion of course platforms and the scarcity of student data increases the difficulty in finding courses, or even part of courses, that fill a given knowledge gap. In this paper, we propose a recommendation system to support students in finding the best modules or courses in these ecosystems. First, topic modeling techniques were implemented with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to find similarities between multiple MOOCs providers. Then, a content-based recommendation provides recommendations to a user interested in acquiring new knowledge, based on a history extraction on those platforms. We evaluate our approach through an experiment with real data collected in multiple MOOCs providers. In addition, by comparing the NMF approach with a baseline Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique, we verify the model effectiveness and show that our system is useful to this context.},

@inproceedings{jing_2017_guess_you_like_course_recommendation_in_moocs,
	abstract = {Recommending courses to online students is a fundamental and also challenging issue in MOOCs. Not exactly like recommendation in traditional online systems, students who enrolled the same course may have very different purposes and with very different backgrounds. For example, one may want to study "data mining" after studying the course of "big data analytics" because the former is a prerequisite course of the latter, while some other may choose "data mining" simply because of curiosity.Employing the complete data from XuetangX1, one of the largest MOOCs in China, we conduct a systematic investigation on the problem of student behavior modeling for course recommendation. We design a content-aware algorithm framework using content based users' access behaviors to extract user-specific latent information to represent students' interest profile. We also leverage the demographics and course prerequisite relation to better reveal users' potential choice. Finally, we develop a course recommendation algorithm based on the user interest, demographic profiles and course prerequisite relation using collaborative filtering strategy. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs much better than several baselines (over 2X by MRR). We have deployed the recommendation algorithm onto the platform XuetangX as a new feature, which significantly helps improve the course recommendation performance (+24.6\% by click rate) comparing with the recommendation strategy previously used in the system.},

@article{sisco_2017_when_do_extreme_weather_events_generate_attention_to_climate_change,
	abstract = {We analyzed the effects of 10,748 weather events on attention to climate change between December 2011 and November 2014 in local areas across the USA. Attention was gauged by quantifying the relative increase in Twitter messages about climate change in the local area around the time of each event. Coastal floods, droughts, wildfires, strong wind, hail, excessive heat, extreme cold, and heavy snow events all had detectable effects. Attention was reliably higher directly after events began, compared to directly before. Financial damage associated with the weather events had a positive and significant effect on attention, although the effect was small. The abnormality of each weather event's occurrence compared to local historical activity was also a significant predictor. In particular and in line with past research, relative abnormalities in temperature (local warming) generated attention to climate change. In contrast, wind speed was predictive of attention to climate change in absolute levels. These results can be useful to predict short-term attention to climate change for strategic climate communications and to better forecast long-term climate policy support.},

	abstract = {We present FLAIR, an NLP framework designed to facilitate training and distribution of state-of-the-art sequence labeling, text classification and language models. The core idea of the framework is to present a simple, unified interface for conceptually very different types of word and document embeddings. This effectively hides all embedding-specific engineering complexity and allows researchers to {``}mix and match{''} various embeddings with little effort. The framework also implements standard model training and hyperparameter selection routines, as well as a data fetching module that can download publicly available NLP datasets and convert them into data structures for quick set up of experiments. Finally, FLAIR also ships with a {``}model zoo{''} of pre-trained models to allow researchers to use state-of-the-art NLP models in their applications. This paper gives an overview of the framework and its functionality. The framework is available on GitHub at https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair .},

@inproceedings{akbik_2018_contextual_string_embeddings_for_sequence_labeling,
	abstract = {Recent advances in language modeling using recurrent neural networks have made it viable to model language as distributions over characters. By learning to predict the next character on the basis of previous characters, such models have been shown to automatically internalize linguistic concepts such as words, sentences, subclauses and even sentiment. In this paper, we propose to leverage the internal states of a trained character language model to produce a novel type of word embedding which we refer to as contextual string embeddings. Our proposed embeddings have the distinct properties that they (a) are trained without any explicit notion of words and thus fundamentally model words as sequences of characters, and (b) are contextualized by their surrounding text, meaning that the same word will have different embeddings depending on its contextual use. We conduct a comparative evaluation against previous embeddings and find that our embeddings are highly useful for downstream tasks: across four classic sequence labeling tasks we consistently outperform the previous state-of-the-art. In particular, we significantly outperform previous work on English and German named entity recognition (NER), allowing us to report new state-of-the-art F1-scores on the CoNLL03 shared task. We release all code and pre-trained language models in a simple-to-use framework to the research community, to enable reproduction of these experiments and application of our proposed embeddings to other tasks: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair},

@article{hahnel_2020_emotional_foundations_of_the_public_climate_change_divide,
	abstract = { The worldwide rise of climate skeptical political leaders endangers sorely needed political efforts to mitigate climate change. In addition, climate skepticism expressed by the political elites may spread to the electorate, thus ultimately affecting mitigation actions at the population level. It is crucial to better understand the psychological mechanisms underlying elite influences on public opinion formation and polarization. Here we show how affective processes contribute to these top-down influences using longitudinal data in the context of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Findings revealed a general decrease in climate change beliefs immediately after the presidential election (November 2016). We moreover found an increase in positive emotions and a decrease in negative emotions toward the Republican Party after the election of President Trump. Most importantly, the positive emotional shift towards the Republican Party mediated the decrease in climate change beliefs: Individuals with pronounced increases in positive emotions toward the Republican Party most strongly reduced their belief in climate change after the presidential election. The effect was intensified among Republican partisans, pointing towards a mechanism underlying political polarization. Using data based on a major real-world political event, our findings illustrate how partisans update their beliefs by referring to the positions of relevant political authorities. We moreover demonstrate how emotions drive top-down influences of political leaders on partisans' opinions and beliefs. Finally, our findings reveal how intensified emotions can contribute to the aggravation of the public climate change divide.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the approach that was developed for SemEval 2021 Task 7 (Hahackathon: Incorporating Demographic Factors into Shared Humor Tasks) by the DUTH Team. We used and compared a variety of preprocessing techniques, vectorization methods, and numerous conventional machine learning algorithms, in order to construct classification and regression models for the given tasks. We used majority voting to combine the models{'} outputs with small Neural Networks (NN) for classification tasks and their mean for regression for improving our system{'}s performance. While these methods proved weaker than modern, deep learning models, they are still relevant in research tasks because of their low requirements on computational power and faster training.},

	abstract = {Decision support models for satisfactory restaurants have attracted numerous researchers' attention. Many extant models do not consider the active, neutral and passive information in online reviews all at once. Moreover, they ignore the effect of interdependence among criteria on tourists' decision-making. To cover these defects, this study proposes a restaurant decision support model using social information for tourists on TripAdvisor.com. The model introduces fuzzy sets to denote online reviews and utilizes Bonferroni mean to consider interdependence among criteria. Furthermore, it uses a novel similarity measurement which can handle sparse data in fuzzy environments. To validate the model, we conduct a case study of TripAdvisor.com which compares the proposed model with four other models. The performance of each model is evaluated by the metric called the mean absolute error. The study shows that the proposed model can effectively support tourists' decision-making and it performs better than the other four models.},

@article{zhang_2018_mcrs_a_course_recommendation_system_for_moocs,
	abstract = {With the popularization development of MOOC platform, the number of online courses grows rapidly. Efficient and appropriate course recommendation can improve learning efficiency. Traditional recommendation system is applied to the closed educational environment in which the quantity of courses and users is relatively stable. Recommendation model and algorithm cannot directly be applied to MOOC platform efficiently. With the light of the characteristics of MOOC platform, MCRS proposed in this paper has made great improvement in the course recommendation model and recommendation algorithm. MCRS is based on distributed computation framework. The basic algorithm of MCRS is distributed association rules mining algorithm, which based on the improvement of Apriori algorithm. In addition, it is useful to mine the hidden courses rules in course enrollment data. Firstly, the data is pre-processed into a standard form by Hadoop. It aims to improve the efficiency of the basic algorithm. Then it mines association rules of the standard data by Spark. Consequently, course recommendation information is transferred into MySQL through Sqoop, which makes timely feedback and improves user's courses retrieval efficiency. Finally, to validate the efficiency of MCRS, a series of experiments are carried out on Hadoop and Spark, and the results shows that MCRS is more efficient than traditional Apriori algorithm and Apriori algorithm based on Hadoop, and the MCRS is suitable for current MOOC platform.},

The main challenge in providing a personalized learning path is finding the right match between individual characteristics and learning content sequences. This paper presents a collaborative optimization algorithm, combining ant colony optimization and a genetic algorithm to provide learners with a personalized learning path. The proposed algorithm utilizes the stochastic nature of ant colony optimization and exploration characteristics of the genetic algorithm to build an optimal solution. Performance of the proposed algorithm has been assessed by conducting qualitative and quantitative experiments. This study establishes that the hybrid approach provides a better solution than the traditional approach.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, technology is affecting every aspect of our society in different manner. However, the technology impact is more tangible in the field of education. Technological advances are transforming the way education is being delivered. Courses are not limited for those who are attending university or school classes. The proliferation of Web Technologies and the exploration of the possibilities of Technology Enhance Learning (TEL) led to the development of many learning solutions and recently to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). MOOCs are capable of providing several ten thousands of learners with access to courses over the web. Recently, there are many MOOCs providers/platforms with different features and characteristics. Online learners are exposed to various challenges with this excess of those MOOCs providers. This paper presents a system that is built in the top of MOOCs providers to act as a single point of access to those providers. This system is twofold: first, it will improve the learning process for any online learner in a way that satisfies the learner needs when searching for suitable courses among different providers; It will help users not to be lost in the overwhelming offers of MOOCs. Second, it will recommend courses related to the previous experiences of its users.},

This article, written as an editorial introduction to a special issue includes works related to control measurement and ethical behavior, misbehaviors in finances and accounting, professionalism in accounting, ethical investing and corporate reporting. We conclude by suggesting further research for a better integration of technical aspects of accounting and finances into business activity---human activity actually---and an for understanding of ethics not limited to rules, but as a mutual and interdependent system of values (human goods), virtues and principles.},

@article{li_2022_key_factors_in_mooc_pedagogy_based_on_nlp_sentiment_analysis_of_learner_reviews_what_makes_a_hit,
	abstract = {MOOC platforms have seen significant membership growth in recent years. MOOCs are leading the education world that has been digitized, remote, and highly competitive, and the competition is intense in the MOOC world. Based on the observation for top-rated MOOCs, this study proposes a research question, ``What makes a great MOOC? What makes a hit?'' To explore the answers, this study applies a crowdsourcing approach and interprets the semantics of reviews for the top-rated courses on Coursera.org. The paper has multiple steps and findings relevant to MOOC programs at universities worldwide. First, through exploratory analysis of learner reviews and expert judgment, this study identifies two distinct course categories focusing on learners' outcome intent, namely knowledge-seeking MOOCs and skill-seeking MOOCs. Further, this study uses a topical ontology of keywords and sentiment techniques to derive the intent of learners based on their comments. Through sentiment analysis and correlation analysis, it shows that knowledge-seeking MOOCs are driven by the quality of course design and materials. Skill-seeking MOOCs are driven by the instructor and their ability to present lectures and integrate course materials and assignments. This crowdsourcing method obtains the insights from large samples of learners' reviews without the priming or self-selection biases of open surveys or interviews. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging online learner reviews and offer practical implications for what truly ``makes a hit'' for top-rated MOOCs.},

A questionnaire based on Constructivism Theory and the Technology Acceptance Model was employed as the main data collection method, which was distributed to 723 research students in five Malaysian research universities. Based on the obtained results, male and female students' satisfaction of social media use for collaborative learning and engagement positively affected their learning performance, although in the case of females, they were not fully satisfied with perceived ease of use and usefulness. The study concludes that overall, active collaborative learning and engagement through social media enriches the learning activities of students and facilitates group discussions, and hence, their use should be encouraged in learning and teaching processes in higher education institutions.},

	abstract = {Nowadays online reviews play a significant role in influencing the decision of consumers. Consumers show their experience and information about product quality in their reviews. Product Reviews from Amazon to Restaurant Reviews from Yelp are facing problems with fake reviews and fake numeric ratings. Online reviews typically consist of qualitative (text format) and quantitative (rating) formats. In the case of Google Play store fake numeric ratings can play a big role in the success of apps. People tend to believe that a high-star rating may be significantly attached with a good review. However, user star level rating information does not usually match with text format of review. Despite many efforts to resolve this issue, Apple App Store and Google Play Store are still facing this problem. This study proposes a novel Google App numeric reviews & ratings contradiction prediction framework using Deep Learning approaches. The framework consists of two phases. In the first phase, the polarity of reviews are predicted using sentiment analysis tool to build ground truth. In the second phase, star ratings are predicted from text format of reviews after training deep learning models on ground truth obtained in the first phase. Experimental results demonstrate that based on actual user reviews the proposed framework significantly predicts unbiased star rating of app.},

We suggest that the Anna Karenina principle positing a greater variability of the factors leading to business failure as opposed to those leading to success can be applied to the domain of visitors' reviews of historic and cultural attractions. The larger variability of issues in reviews of dissatisfied visitors is likely to result in limitations for automated topic modeling. We confirm our proposition using TripAdvisor reviews of the Terracotta Army museum in China, and validate the outcome with two additional sites. The study strongly suggests that application of unsupervised topic mining algorithms to negative reviews may be problematic and the results should be treated with caution. The main themes of dissatisfaction of visitors to all three sites are reported and practical implications for management of the attractions are discussed.},

At present, the methods to solve the problem of data imbalance can be divided into data-level methods, algorithm-level methods and hybrid methods. In this paper, we propose a weighted hybrid ensemble method for classifying imbalanced data in binary classification tasks, called WHMBoost. In the framework of the boosting algorithm, the presented method combines two data sampling methods and two base classifiers, and each sampling method and each base classifier is assigned corresponding weights, which makes them have better complementary advantages. The performance of WHMBoost has been evaluated on 40 benchmark imbalanced datasets with state of the art ensemble methods like AdaBoost, RUSBoost, SMOTEBoost using AUC, F-Measure and Geometric Mean as the performance evaluation criteria. Experimental results show significant improvement over the other methods and it can be concluded that WHMBoost is a promising and effective algorithm to deal with imbalance datasets.},

@article{yan_2020_a_hybrid_scheme_based_one_vs_all_decision_trees_for_multi_class_classification_tasks,
	abstract = {Decision tree algorithms have been proved to be a powerful and popular approach in classification tasks. However, they do not have reasonable classification performance in multi-class scenarios. In the present study, decision tree algorithms are combined with the one-vs-all (OVA) binarization technique to improve the generalization capabilities of the scheme. However, unlike previous literature that has focused on aggregation strategies, the present study is focused on the process of building base classifiers over the OVA scheme. A novel split criterion, entitled by the splitting point correction matrix (SPCM), is proposed in this regards, which can effectively deal with the unbalance problem caused by the OVA scheme. The SPCM is a kind of hybrid scheme, which integrates distribution and permutation information from the training data at each splitting point. Therefore, compared to other classical split criteria, such as the C4.5, the proposed method can make the right choice about the optimal splitting point at the root or internal nodes from multi-angle. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the SPCM approach, extensive experiments are carried out compared to the classical and state-of-the-art methods. The experiments are performed on sixteen datasets, where the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed method is verified. It is concluded that the SPCM method not only has excellent classification performance but also produces a more compact decision tree. Moreover, it is found that the SPCM method has especially a considerable improvement in the depth of tree.},

@article{shan_2020_learn_a_novel_incremental_learning_method_for_text_classification,
	abstract = {Deep learning is an effective method for extracting the underlying information in text. However, it performs better on closed datasets and is less effective in real-world scenarios for text classification. As the data is updated and the amount of data increases, the models need to be retrained, in what is often a long training process. Therefore, we propose a novel incremental learning strategy to solve these problems. Our method, called Learn#, includes four components: a Student model, a reinforcement learning (RL) module, a Teacher model, and a discriminator model. The Student models first extract the features from the texts, then the RL module filters the results of multiple Student models. After that, the Teacher model reclassifies the filtered results to obtain the final texts category. To avoid increasing the Student models unlimitedly as the number of samples increases, the discriminator model is used to filter the Student models based on their similarity. The Learn# method has the advantage of a shorter training time than the One-Time model, because it only needs to train a new Student model each time, without changing the existing Student models. Furthermore, it can also obtain feedback during application and tune the models parameters over time. Experiments on different datasets show that our method for text classification outperforms many traditional One-Time methods, reducing training time by nearly 80%.},

The hotel attributes given focus include: (a) Service, (b) Cleanliness, (c) Room, (d) Sleep Quality, (e) Location, and (f) Value. In total, 353 hotels with 2,020 usable individual complaining reviews representing five different continents and 63 nationalities were collected for the analysis, which was conducted using a manual coding approach. Results indicate that online complaining behavior is influenced by cultural background. Asian and non-Asian travelers appear to place a similar emphasis on Value for money. However, Asian guests are more likely to complain about Service, while non-Asian guests are more likely to complaint about Cleanliness, Room, Sleep Quality, and Location. Additionally, online complaining behavior varies between different classes of hotel. Guests of high-class hotels are more likely to complain about Service and Value, while guests of low-class hotels are more likely to complain about Cleanliness, Room, Sleep Quality, and Location. This study contributes to the realm of hotel management by providing a better understanding of how customers from different cultural backgrounds are likely to perceive different hotel attributes.},

	abstract = {Tree-based machine learning models such as random forests, decision trees and gradient boosted trees are popular nonlinear predictive models, yet comparatively little attention has been paid to explaining their predictions. Here we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions. (1) A polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. (2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model's performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains.},

	abstract = {More recently, deep neural networks received much attention from the recommender systems community where CNNs and RNNs were applied in different recommendation contexts and achieved state-of-the-art results on many publicly available benchmarks. While the success of the neural models came from their high expressiveness, the uninterpretability problem still one of their main drawbacks, which can have a negative side effect on the whole learning process. A good candidate to reduce the uninterpretability is using Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL), which showed a strong performance in dealing with this problem. Moreover, sparsity is another major problem of the most previous recommendation systems. In this paper, we introduce a new recommender system framework based on the generalized distillation principle that combines two modeling approaches: PSL for the knowledge-driven modeling approach and deep neural networks for the data-driven approach. Experimental results on publicly available datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art based on deep neural networks emphasizing the utility of PSL rules in handling inconsistencies, reducing the uninterpretability of the neural models and shows promising results in dealing with sparsity.},

	abstract = {People increasingly choose to express themselves online through electronic word of mouth (eWOM), generating large amounts of data, making eWOM a valuable source of information through big data analytics. This enables organizations to gain insights directly from customers' opinions for better decision making. This work presents a new methodology for evaluating an organisation's product-positioning strategy through eWOM analytics. A product's mispositioning has significant negative effects and there is strong interest in identifying ways to avoid it. Current methods that utilize eWOM for product positioning evaluation mostly use post-product release reviews and do not statistically evaluate the effect of time on the product positioning; nor do they provide any means to diagnose the cause of mispositioning. The temporal aspect of positioning, however, provides valuable insights into which product features are more time-invariant and accordingly makes it possible to plan for product redesign or repositioning to maximize profitability. A case study is presented in the context of smartphones using design science research, utilizing Twitter data regarding the release of a new product, collected using a custom Android application. The research questions addressed in this paper are: (1) How do consumers' preferences change over time with regards to the product's positioning? (2) Which product features positively influence product positioning and which negatively? To answer these questions, we compared the product-positioning strategy and consumers' opinions before and after the release of a new product to identify possible discrepancies between expected and actual positioning of the product. This work constitutes a methodological contribution with demonstrated implications for new product positioning strategy evaluation using tweet analysis.},

Despite many international mall-shopper studies, only few have compared countries using uniform constructs and descriptors. The present study sought to compare shopper segments from four countries----England, France, Ghana, and Morocco----to examine the impact of national culture (reflected through Hofstede's individualism/collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, long-/short-term orientation, and indulgence/restraint) and economic capacity (purchasing power parity) on shopper behavior. Findings suggest that culture shapes the nature of shoppers' profiles. However, purchase behavior and spending rates impacted more by culture in rich countries and more by the economic situation in poor countries. The implication is that international retailers and mall managers should consider national culture as well as economic factors in their global operations.},

For data collection and analysis, several custom-made python scripts were used. Data underwent integration, cleansing, incomplete data processing, and imbalance data treatments prior to being analysed. The patterns that emerged from the DT are expressed in terms of rules that highlight variable combinations leading to negative or positive sentiment.

@article{arrieta_2020_explainable_artificial_intelligence_xai_concepts_taxonomies_opportunities_and_challenges_toward_responsible_ai,
	abstract = {In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

The results show that hotel attribute performance, previous eWOM experience, and platform convenience are the drivers of eWOM behaviors in general. Demographics and lodging preference do not affect eWOM behaviors. Economic incentives also have no effect on eWOM behaviors, which suggests that good reviews cannot be bought. The performance of core attributes can improve eWOM activities and eWOM praise, but the performance of facilitating attributes helps only with eWOM praise.},

	abstract = {Culture has been assumed to influence tourist behavior but due to the difficulty of measuring culture values directly at the individual level, the relationship between national culture and visitor satisfaction remains yet to be empirically attested. This study used two national level inbound tourist samples, i.e., Tourism Research Australia's 2017 International Visitor Survey holiday/pleasure travellers' sample and the Hong Kong Tourist Satisfaction Index Project 2016 sample, to test the relationships between Hofstede's six cultural dimensions (Power Distance, Individualism/Collectivism, Masculinity/Femininity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long Term Orientation/Short Term Normative Orientation, and Indulgence/Restraint) and visitor satisfaction. Bivariate correlation with bootstrapping tests show consistent correlations between four of the six cultural dimensions and visitor satisfaction across the two samples. While Individualism and Indulgence are found to be positively related to visitor satisfaction, Power Distance and Long Term Orientation are negatively related to visitor satisfaction. The findings are validated with a further test involving the concept of cultural distance. This study contributes to the literature by providing solid evidence on the relation between culture and visitor satisfaction. Calls for future research are discussed.},

@article{liu_2019_market_segmentation_a_multiple_criteria_approach_combining_preference_analysis_and_segmentation_decision,
	abstract = {We propose a new multiple criteria decision aiding approach for market segmentation that integrates preference analysis and segmentation decision within a unified framework. The approach employs an additive value function as the preference model and requires consumers to provide pairwise comparisons of some products as the preference information. To analyze each consumer's preferences, the approach applies the disaggregation paradigm and the stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis to derive a set of value functions according to the preference information provided by each consumer. Then, each consumer's preferences can be represented by the distribution of possible rankings of products and associated support degrees by applying the derived value functions. On the basis of preference analysis, a new metric is proposed to measure the similarity between preferences of different consumers, and a hierarchical clustering algorithm is developed to perform market segmentation. To help firms serve consumers from different segments with targeted marketing policies and appropriate products, the approach proposes to work out a representative value function and the univocal ranking of products for each consumer so that products that rank in the front of the list can be presented to her/him. Finally, an illustrative example of a market segmentation problem details the application of the proposed approach.},

While the methodology applies to optimization problems in general, most TS applications have been and continue to be in discrete optimization. A key and distinguishing feature of tabu search is the use of special strategies based on adaptive memory. The underlying philosophy is that an effective search for optimal solutions should involve a flexible process that responds to the objective function landscape in a manner that allows it to learn appropriate directions to exploit specific areas of the solution space and useful departures to explore new terrain. The adaptive memory structures of tabu search enable the implementation of procedures that are capable of searching effectively and produce solutions of suitable quality within reasonable computational effort.},

When a metal is heated to a sufficiently high temperature, its atoms undergo disordered movements of large amplitude. If one now cools the metal down progressively, the atoms reduce their movement and tend to stabilize around fixed positions in a regular crystal structure with minimal energy. In this state, in which internal structural constraints are minimized, ductility is improved and the metal becomes easier to work. This slow cooling process is called annealing by metallurgists and it is to be contrasted with the quenching process, which consists of a rapid cooling down of the metal or alloy.},

@article{blut_2018_testing_retail_marketing_mix_effects_on_patronage_a_meta_analysis,
	abstract = {Retailers have always worked to establish close relationships with customers through the retail marketing mix. Thus, the literature has a long tradition of testing the effects of various instruments on retail patronage. This meta-study synthesizes prior research into one comprehensive framework. We use 14,895 effect sizes reported by more than 239,000 shoppers from 41 countries extracted from 350 independent samples, to test the impact of 24 marketing-mix instruments on retail patronage. Specifically, we investigate the direct and indirect effects of these instruments on store satisfaction, word of mouth, patronage intention, and behavior. Product and brand management related instruments display the strongest effects on most outcome variables, whereas price, communication, service and incentive management instruments affect only selected outcomes. Distribution management turns out to be of secondary importance. However, the effectiveness of these instruments depends on the specific shopping context (food/non-food, shopping frequency, single store/agglomeration, hedonic/utilitarian), the retail environment (gross domestic product, country innovativeness, retail sales share, retail employment, Internet era), and the employed method (participant type, study design, data source). Specifically, we reveal most differences for hedonic shopping environments and developed countries. Also, the store's advertising and atmosphere have gained importance in the Internet era, while purchase incentives, in-store orientation, and store location have lost relevance. This study contributes to a synoptic understanding of the comparable effectiveness of retail marketing instruments on retail patronage. It offers insights into the effectiveness of marketing-mix instruments and provides guidance on whether and when to invest in them. It also presents an agenda for future research on marketing-mix instruments.},

@article{gambhir_2017_recent_automatic_text_summarization_techniques_a_survey,
	abstract = {As information is available in abundance for every topic on internet, condensing the important information in the form of summary would benefit a number of users. Hence, there is growing interest among the research community for developing new approaches to automatically summarize the text. Automatic text summarization system generates a summary, i.e. short length text that includes all the important information of the document. Since the advent of text summarization in 1950s, researchers have been trying to improve techniques for generating summaries so that machine generated summary matches with the human made summary. Summary can be generated through extractive as well as abstractive methods. Abstractive methods are highly complex as they need extensive natural language processing. Therefore, research community is focusing more on extractive summaries, trying to achieve more coherent and meaningful summaries. During a decade, several extractive approaches have been developed for automatic summary generation that implements a number of machine learning and optimization techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent text summarization extractive approaches developed in the last decade. Their needs are identified and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in a comparative manner. A few abstractive and multilingual text summarization approaches are also covered. Summary evaluation is another challenging issue in this research field. Therefore, intrinsic as well as extrinsic both the methods of summary evaluation are described in detail along with text summarization evaluation conferences and workshops. Furthermore, evaluation results of extractive summarization approaches are presented on some shared DUC datasets. Finally this paper concludes with the discussion of useful future directions that can help researchers to identify areas where further research is needed.},

The objectives of feature selection include building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data-mining performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. The recent proliferation of big data has presented some substantial challenges and opportunities to feature selection. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in feature selection research. Motivated by current challenges and opportunities in the era of big data, we revisit feature selection research from a data perspective and review representative feature selection algorithms for conventional data, structured data, heterogeneous data and streaming data. Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for conventional data, we categorize them into four main groups: similarity-based, information-theoretical-based, sparse-learning-based, and statistical-based methods. To facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present an open source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (http://featureselection.asu.edu/). Also, we use it as an example to show how to evaluate feature selection algorithms. At the end of the survey, we present a discussion about some open problems and challenges that require more attention in future research.},

Fervent research is currently being focused in both academia and industry in this domain. Proof-of-Work (PoW), a cryptographic puzzle, plays a vital r{\^o}le in ensuring BC security by maintaining a digital ledger of transactions, which are considered to be incorruptible. Furthermore, BC uses a changeable Public Key (PK) to record the identity of users -- thus providing an extra layer of privacy. Not only in crypto-currency has the successful adoption of the BC been implemented, but also in multifaceted non-monetary systems, such as in: distributed storage systems, proof-of-location and healthcare. Recent research articles and projects/applications were surveyed to assess the implementation of the BC for IoT Security and identify associated challenges and propose solutions for BC enabled enhanced security for the IoT ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Language processing of Sanskrit presents various challenges in the field of computational linguistics. Prosodical, orthographic and inflectional complexities encountered in Sanskrit texts makes it difficult to apply linguistic analysis methods relevant for western European languages. The inadequacy of contemporary computational approaches in the analysis of Sanskrit language is vivdly apparent. In this exposition, we focus on the challenge of learning syntactic and semantic similarities in a rich Sanskrit literature. We present a simple yet effective approach of representing Sanskrit words in a continuous vector space. We utilise word embeddings in similarity, compositionality and visualization tasks to test its efficacy. Experiments show that our method produces interpretable vector offsets exhibiting shared relationships.},

@inproceedings{zhang_2018_aggregating_neural_word_embeddings_for_document_representation,
	abstract = {Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have shown that semantically meaningful representations of words can be efficiently acquired by distributed models. In such a case, a text document can be viewed as a bag-of-word-embeddings (BoWE), and the remaining question is how to obtain a fixed-length vector representation of the document for efficient document process. Beyond those heuristic aggregation methods, recent work has shown that one can leverage the Fisher kernel (FK) framework to generate document representations based on BoWE in a principled way. In this work, words are embedded into a Euclidean space by latent semantic indexing (LSI), and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is employed as the generative model for nonlinear FK-based aggregation. In this work, we propose an alternate FK-based aggregation method for document representation based on neural word embeddings. As we know, neural embedding models have been proven significantly better performance in word representations than LSI, where semantic relations between neural word embeddings are typically measured by cosine similarity rather than Euclidean distance. Therefore, we introduce a mixture of Von Mises-Fisher distributions (moVMF) as the generative model of neural word embeddings, and derive a new FK-based aggregation method for document representation based on BoWE. We report document classification, clustering and retrieval experiments and demonstrate that our model can produce state-of-the-art performance as compared with existing baseline methods.},

@article{belford_2018_stability_of_topic_modeling_via_matrix_factorization,
	abstract = {Topic models can provide us with an insight into the underlying latent structure of a large corpus of documents. A range of methods have been proposed in the literature, including probabilistic topic models and techniques based on matrix factorization. However, in both cases, standard implementations rely on stochastic elements in their initialization phase, which can potentially lead to different results being generated on the same corpus when using the same parameter values. This corresponds to the concept of ``instability'' which has previously been studied in the context of k-means clustering. In many applications of topic modeling, this problem of instability is not considered and topic models are treated as being definitive, even though the results may change considerably if the initialization process is altered. In this paper we demonstrate the inherent instability of popular topic modeling approaches, using a number of new measures to assess stability. To address this issue in the context of matrix factorization for topic modeling, we propose the use of ensemble learning strategies. Based on experiments performed on annotated text corpora, we show that a K-Fold ensemble strategy, combining both ensembles and structured initialization, can significantly reduce instability, while simultaneously yielding more accurate topic models.},

@article{ye_2017_predicting_the_helpfulness_of_online_reviews_using_a_scripts_enriched_text_regression_model,
	abstract = {In this paper, we examine the utility of script analysis for predicting the helpfulness of online customer reviews. We employ the lens of cognitive scripts and posit that people share a cognitive script for what constitutes a helpful review in a given domain. Conceptually, a script includes the salient elements that readers look for before determining whether a review is helpful. To operationalize the construct of cognitive script, we seek the help of human annotators and ask them to highlight phrases that they believe are important for determining review helpfulness. The words in the annotated phrases are collected and become part of the script lexicon for a given domain. The lexicon entries represent the shared conception of essential elements, which are key to the evaluation of review helpfulness. We employ the words in the script lexicon as features in a text regression model to predict review helpfulness. Furthermore, we develop and empirically validate a new approach for combining script analysis and dimension reduction. The purpose of the study is to propose a new method to predict review helpfulness and to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the scripts-enriched model. To demonstrate the efficacy of the scripts-enriched model, we compare it with benchmark models -- a Baseline model and a bag-of-words (BOW) model. The results show that the scripts-enriched text regression model not only produces the highest accuracy, but also the lowest training, testing, and feature selection times.},

@article{lee_2018_assessment_of_airport_service_quality_a_complementary_approach_to_measure_perceived_service_quality_based_on_google_reviews,
	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that user-generated online contents can be used as an alternative data source for assessing airport service quality, which effectively complements and cross-validates the conventional service quality surveys. We apply sentiment analysis and topic modeling technique to 42,137 reviews collected from Google Maps. The results are compared to the well-publicized ASQ ratings conducted by Airport Council International. The sentiment scores computed from the textual Google reviews are very good predictors of the associated Google star ratings, with rs(96) = 0.89, p < .01 in 2016. The correlation could be further improved (rs(96) = 0.90) by customizing the sentiment lexicon leveraging the information gained from the previous year's analysis. Also, both the sentiment scores and Google star ratings are found to have a reasonably strong association with the ASQ ratings, with rs(78) = 0.63, p < .01 and rs(78) = 0.64, p < .01, respectively, in 2016, excluding outliers. These results indicate that the online reviews provide a good proxy for airport service quality ratings and an effective means to cross-validate the conventional industry standard survey results. Further, the study extracts 25 latent topics from the Google reviews through a topic modeling analysis. The 25 topics show good correspondence with the ASQ service attributes, suggesting that the ASQ program effectively covers all the service quality attributes of airport users. Also, further analysis indicates that the relative importance of service attributes varies depending on the size of the airports and that some ASQ service attributes may not be relevant anymore for most passengers.},

	abstract = {Recently, the Internet has brought a big change in tourists' behavior patterns. Travelers not only reserve hotels and airline tickets online, but also exchange travel information and descriptions of pleasant or unpleasant travel experiences through online review sites and personal travel blogs. In spite of the increasing use of online channels, application of online text data has been limited since the volume of the data set is too large to analyze manually and comprehensively. With recent technological advances in processing big data online, consumer-generated information can be automatically analyzed by artificial intelligence. As an aspect of smart tourism, this study applied the sentiment analysis method to analyze travelers' online reviews of Paris. A total of 19,835 pieces of review data collected from a traveler review site (www.virtualtourist.com) were processed. All reviews were grouped into 14 categories as follows: overview, restaurants, sightseeing, hotels, things to do, night life, transportation, shopping, sporting & outdoors, favorites, off the beaten path, what to pack, tourist traps, warnings and danger, and local customs. Tourists' perception about the service in each category was successfully measured, and as an illustration, we chose ``transportation'' category that reported relatively low level of service quality for post-hoc analysis to reveal why tourists feel negatively about the transportation service.},

Our results find consistency between customer ratings and actual customer feelings across hotels belonging to the two categories of premium and budget. Customer sentiment polarity explains significant variation in customer ratings across both the hotel categories. With regard to managerial implications, the study finds that, when compared with premium hotels, managers of budget hotels should improve their staff performance and hotel services.

	abstract = {Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications on real-life textual content require a suitable fit for purpose corpora, which can accommodate the ambiguity of the domain. Researchers in the field managed to synthesize gold-standard corpora in many domains and for varying tasks, assisted by domain experts and linguists. The wealth of information buried in free-text electronic documents in healthcare systems presents itself as a leading contender for NLP applications. In this literature review, the efforts to come up and utilize a clinically annotated corpus in a particular healthcare information extraction task are explored. Those efforts can be more pronounced when done on a new language with limited existing gold-standard clinical references. A great number of people around the globe interact with healthcare systems in languages other than English. Advancing the Clinical NLP research in their languages will propel the general progress in the field and potential healthcare advantages considerably. For the purposes of this review, we considered three major world languages: Spanish, Italian, and Chinese. This led to considering the research question to be about the viability of the creation or utilization of a gold-standard clinical corpus in a language other than English and how it can contribute in performing a complex clinical language mining task. The implementations reviewed in these languages considered varying approaches to overcome complexities in biomedical NLP in these languages. This study managed to highlight novel solutions to complex tasks and found that efforts in these languages can be highly successful if a non-English medical corpus is created from scratch, off-the-shelf tools are used or machine translation is considered to bridge the gap in biomedical NLP domain-specific lingual resources in these languages.},

@inproceedings{devlin_2019_bert_pre_training_of_deep_bidirectional_transformers_for_language_understanding,
	abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

@article{gangavarapu_2020_predicting_icd_9_code_groups_with_fuzzy_similarity_based_supervised_multi_label_classification_of_unstructured_clinical_nursing_notes,
	abstract = {In hospitals, caregivers are trained to chronicle the subtle changes in the clinical conditions of a patient at regular intervals, for enabling decision-making. Caregivers' text-based clinical notes are a significant source of rich patient-specific data, that can facilitate effective clinical decision support, despite which, this treasure-trove of data remains largely unexplored for supporting the prediction of clinical outcomes. The application of sophisticated data modeling and prediction algorithms with greater computational capacity have made disease prediction from raw clinical notes a relevant problem. In this paper, we propose an approach based on vector space and topic modeling, to structure the raw clinical data by capturing the semantic information in the nursing notes. Fuzzy similarity based data cleansing approach was used to merge anomalous and redundant patient data. Furthermore, we utilize eight supervised multi-label classification models to facilitate disease (ICD-9 code group) prediction. We present an exhaustive comparative study to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches using standard evaluation metrics. Experimental validation on MIMIC-III, an open database, underscored the superior performance of the proposed Term weighting of unstructured notes AGgregated using fuzzy Similarity (TAGS) model, which consistently outperformed the state-of-the-art structured data based approach by 7.79% in AUPRC and 1.24% in AUROC.},

The Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) eHealth 2020 continues our development of evaluation tasks and resources since 2012 to address laypeople's difficulties to retrieve and digest valid and relevant information in their preferred language to make health-centred decisions. This year's lab advertised two tasks. Task 1 on Information Extraction (IE) was new and focused on automatic clinical coding of diagnosis and procedure the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD10) codes as well as finding the corresponding evidence text snippets for clinical case documents in Spanish. Task 2 on Information Retrieval (IR) was a novel extension of the most popular and established task in the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) eHealth on Consumer Health Search (CHS). In total 55 submissions were made to these tasks. Herein, we describe the resources created for the two tasks and evaluation methodology adopted. We also summarize lab submissions and results. As in previous years, the organizers have made data and tools associated with the lab tasks available for future research and development. The ongoing substantial community interest in the tasks and their resources has led to the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) eHealth maturing as a primary venue for all interdisciplinary actors of the ecosystem for producing, processing, and consuming electronic health information.},

	abstract = {This study used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to analyze pre-service teachers'views on the nature of science (NOS). This approach can be used to automate the classification of documents, and at the same time, the researcher does not need to deduce with a NOS framework prior to evaluation. Participants were 155 pre-service teachers studying at the Shandong Normal University in China. To gather our data, we used an open questionnaire, namely, the Views of Nature of Science Questionnaire---Form C (VNOS-C). LDA topic modeling was used to classify the document, which was divided into 12 topics. By comparing the LDA topic modeling results with the theoretical framework behind the VNOS-C questionnaire, we categorized these 12 topics into eight descriptive aspects of the NOS: The Empirical Nature of Scientific Knowledge, Observation, Inference, and Theoretical Entities in Science, Scientific Theories and Laws, The Theory-Laden Nature of Scientific Knowledge, The Social and Cultural Embeddedness of Scientific Knowledge, The Myth of The Scientific Method, The Tentative Nature of Scientific Knowledge, and The Nature of Scientific Theory. The results show that pre-service teachers usually hold naive or mixed views of the NOS. In addition, each aspect of NOS is not independent of each other but interrelated and influencing each other. In the future, more consideration can be given to the relationship between each aspect of NOS.},

Many variations in writing styles and existing dissimilarities among the wide range of symbols and recurring characters make the recognition tasks strenuous even for Optical Character Recognition. The past decade has witnessed the emergence of recognition techniques and the peaking interest of several researchers in this evolving domain. In light of the current research status associated with recognizing handwritten math symbols, a systematic review of the literature seems timely. This article seeks to provide a complete systematic analysis of recognition techniques, models, datasets, sub-stages, accuracy metrics, and accuracy details in an extracted form as described in the literature. A systematic literature review conducted in this study includes pragmatic studies until the year 2021, and the analysis reveals Support Vector Machine (SVM) to be the most dominating recognition technique and symbol recognition rate to be most frequently deployed accuracy measure and other interesting results in terms of segmentation, feature extraction and datasets involved are vividly represented. The statistics of mathematical symbols-related papers are shown, and open problems are identified for more advanced research. Our study focused on the key points of earlier research, present work, and the future direction of MSR.},

	abstract = {The debate about the relationship between economic growth and environmental sustainability triggers a range of associations. Here we analyze open-ended textual responses of citizens and scientists concerning their associations with the terms ``economic growth'' and ``green growth''. We derive from the responses a number of topics and examine how associations differ across distinct opinion segments of people, namely supporters of Green growth, Agrowth and Degrowth. The results indicate that the general public is more critical of the notion of economic growth than academic researchers. Citizens stress problems of corruption, social inequality, unemployment and poverty, with less variation among the three opinion segments compared to scientists. The latter more strongly emphasize the environmental consequences of economic growth. Concerning associations of scientists with the term ``green growth'', we find topics questioning its feasibility to be more likely expressed by Degrowth supporters, while topics stressing the possibility of sustainable economic growth by Green growth supporters. We find that topic polarization is stronger for scientists than citizens. Our results provide further validation for opinion clusters identified in previous studies and uncover additional insights about related views on growth and sustainability.},

@article{sakshi_2021_a_retrospective_study_on_handwritten_mathematical_symbols_and_expressions_classification_and_recognition,
	abstract = {Context:
Many scientific and technical literature documents contain MSs and MEs that are more challenging to be recognized by computers than plain text. The recognition of HMSE becomes not only an ambitious task but a motivating research area covering concepts of computer vision, pattern recognition, feature extraction, and artificial intelligence.
Objective:
The objective is to perform an extensive state of the art on the techniques and methods used for recognizing and classifying HMSE. The authors endeavor to bring out all significant findings in sub-processes, representation models, algorithms, tools, datasets, and comparative analysis of the accuracy of the recognition models.
Method:
The current research implements the standard SLR method based on a comprehensive set of 120 articles published in 21 leading journals and 39 premier conferences and workshops.
Results:
Existing literature about recognition techniques and models is classified broadly into three categories; AI technique (65%) is majorly implemented in the selected studies. The prominent sub-process `segmentation' (52%) is mostly used. The box and tree are the prevailing representation models. The popular datasets are recognized as CROHME 2014 and CROHME 2016, used by 60% of the selected studies. Masaki Nakagawa, C. Viard Guardin, Richard Zanibbi, and Harold Mouchere are the most noticed authors in ME recognition.
Conclusion:
The reviewers call for increased awareness of the potential benefits of existing and emerging recognition techniques and identify the need to develop a more accurate and semantic-based recognition model. Recommendations are given for future research.},

	abstract = {Automatic text summarization is an exertion of contriving the abridged form of a text document covering salient knowledge. Numerous statistical, linguistic, rule-based, and position-based text summarization approaches have been explored for different rich-resourced languages. For under-resourced languages such as Hindi, automatic text summarization is a challenging task and still an unsolved problem. Another issue with such languages is the unavailability of corpus and the inadequacy of the processing tools. In this paper, we proposed an extractive lexical knowledge-rich topic modeling text summarization approach for Hindi novels and stories in which we implemented four independent variants using different sentence weighting schemes. We prepared a corpus of Hindi Novels and stories since the absence of a corpus. We used a smoothing technique for edifying and variety summaries followed by evaluating the efficacy of generated summaries against three metrics (gist diversity, retention ratio, and ROUGE score). The results manifest that the proposed model produces abridge, articulate and coherent summaries. To investigate the performance of the proposed model, we simulate the experiments on the English dataset as well. Further, we compare our models with the baselines and traditional topic modeling approach, where we show that the proposed model has confessed optimal results.},

	abstract = {The main assay tool of COVID-19, as a pandemic, still has significant faults. To ameliorate the current situation, all facilities and tools in this realm should be implemented to encounter this epidemic. The current study has endeavored to propose a self-assessment decision support system (DSS) for distinguishing the severity of the COVID-19 between confirmed cases to optimize the patient care process. For this purpose, a DSS has been developed by the combination of the data-driven Bayesian network (BN) and the Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM). First, all of the data are utilized to extract the evidence-based paired (EBP) relationships between symptoms and symptoms'impact probability. Then, the results are evaluated in both independent and combined scenarios. After categorizing data in the triple severity levels by self-organizing map, the EBP relationships between symptoms are extracted by BN, and their significance is achieved and ranked by FCM. The results show that the most common symptoms necessarily do not have the key role in distinguishing the severity of the COVID-19, and extracting the EBP relationships could have better insight into the severity of the disease.},

@article{leong_2021_a_meta_analysis_of_consumer_innovation_resistance_is_there_a_cultural_invariance,
	abstract = {Purpose In the literature of industrial management, the focus is normally given on examining the factors that contribute to product innovation acceptance. The advocates of ``pro-innovation bias''assume that consumers are open to new products and are willing to accept an innovative product. However, there is a high failure rate of technological innovations and most of the technological innovations were rejected due to users' resistance. Since the inception of innovation resistance theory (IRT), the number of studies that used IRT has gained much attention from scholars. However, the findings from these studies from various contexts are inconsistent, lack universality, and a clear understanding of technological innovation barriers. The study aims to determine whether the IRT theory is indeed valid and whether IRT is culturally invariant from the Eastern and Western cultures. Design/methodology/approach A meta-analysis based on a random-effects model and studies drawn from 24 countries and/or regions with a consolidated sample size of 10,463 was conducted. Cultural invariance was identified based on subgroup analysis. Moderator analysis was performed by applying the weighted linear regression. Findings The results reveal that tradition is the strongest barrier followed by the value, risk, image and usage barrier. Interestingly, there is a cultural invariance in IRT from the Eastern and Western cultures. Besides, there are significant moderating effects due to the temporal factor. Originality/value The study has contributed useful theoretical and managerial implications in advancing the product innovation literature.},

Light food has been favored by the public, especially by the young generation in recent years. Moreover, affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, consumers' awareness of a healthy diet has been improved to a certain extent. As both take-out and in-place orders for light food are growing rapidly, there are massive customer reviews left on the Meituan platform. However, massive, multi-dimensional unstructured data has not yet been fully explored. This research aims to explore the customers' focal points and sentiment polarity of the overall comments and to investigate whether there exist differences of these two aspects before and after the COVID-19. A total of 6968 light food customer reviews on the Meituan platform were crawled and finally used for data analysis. This research first conducted the fine-grained sentiment analysis and classification of the light food customer reviews via the SnowNLP technique. In addition, LDA topic modeling was used to analyze positive and negative topics of customer reviews. The experimental results were visualized and the research showed that the SnowNLP technique and LDA topic modeling achieve high performance in extracting the customers' sentiments and focal points, which provides theoretical and data support for light food businesses to improve customer service. This research contributes to the existing research on LDA modeling and light food customer review analysis. Several practical and feasible suggestions are further provided for managers in the light food industry.},

	abstract = {Recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions (MEs) is an important problem that has wide applications in practice. Handwritten ME recognition is challenging due to the variety of writing styles and ME formats. As a result, recognizers trained by optimizing the traditional supervision loss do not perform satisfactorily. To improve the robustness of the recognizer with respect to writing styles, in this work, we propose a novel paired adversarial learning method to learn semantic-invariant features. Specifically, our proposed model, named PAL-v2, consists of an attention-based recognizer and a discriminator. During training, handwritten MEs and their printed templates are fed into PAL-v2 simultaneously. The attention-based recognizer is trained to learn semantic-invariant features with the guide of the discriminator. Moreover, we adopt a convolutional decoder to alleviate the vanishing and exploding gradient problems of RNN-based decoder, and further, improve the coverage of decoding with a novel attention method. We conducted extensive experiments on the CROHME dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of each part of the method and achieved state-of-the-art performance.},

First, we propose a method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract the representations for an HME. Symbols in various scales are located and classified by a combination of features from a multi-scale CNN. We use weakly supervised training combined with symbols attention to enhance localization and classification predictions.

@article{frank_2020_a_general_framework_for_the_recognition_of_online_handwritten_graphics,
	abstract = {We revisit graph grammar and graph parsing as tools for recognizing graphics. A top-down approach for parsing families of handwritten graphics containing different kinds of symbols and of structural relations is proposed. It has been tested on two distinct domains, namely the recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions and of handwritten flowcharts. In the proposed approach, a graphic is considered as a labeled graph generated by a graph grammar. The recognition problem is translated into a graph parsing problem: Given a set of strokes (input data), a parse tree which represents the best interpretation is extracted. The graph parsing algorithm generates multiple interpretations (consistent with the grammar) that can be ranked according to a global cost function that takes into account the likelihood of symbols and structures. The parsing algorithm consists in recursively partitioning the stroke set according to rules defined in the graph grammar. To constrain the number of partitions to be evaluated, we propose the use of a hypothesis graph, built from data-driven machine learning techniques, to encode the most likely symbol and relation hypotheses. Within this approach, it is easy to relax the stroke ordering constraint allowing interspersed symbols, as opposed to some previous works. Experiments show that our method obtains accuracy comparable to methods specifically developed to recognize domain-dependent data.},

@article{le_2019_pattern_generation_strategies_for_improving_recognition_of_handwritten_mathematical_expressions,
	abstract = {Recognition of Handwritten Mathematical Expressions (HMEs) is a challenging problem because of the ambiguity and complexity of two-dimensional handwriting. Moreover, the lack of large training data is a serious issue, especially for academic recognition systems. In this paper, we propose pattern generation strategies that generate shape and structural variations to improve the performance of recognition systems based on a small training set. For data generation, we employ the public databases: CROHME 2014 and 2016 of online HMEs. The first strategy employs local and global distortions to generate shape variations. The second strategy decomposes an online HME into sub-online HMEs to get more structural variations. The hybrid strategy combines both these strategies to maximize shape and structural variations. The generated online HMEs are converted to images for offline HME recognition. We tested our strategies in an end-to-end recognition system constructed from a recent deep learning model: Convolutional Neural Network and attention-based encoder-decoder. The results of experiments on the CROHME 2014 and 2016 databases demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our strategies: our hybrid strategy achieved classification rates of 48.78% and 45.60%, respectively, on these databases. These results are competitive compared to others reported in recent literature. Our generated datasets are openly available for research community and constitute a useful resource for the HME recognition research in future.},

In order to overcome the limitations, this paper proposes a research paper classification system that can cluster research papers into the meaningful class in which papers are very likely to have similar subjects. The proposed system extracts representative keywords from the abstracts of each paper and topics by Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) scheme. Then, the K-means clustering algorithm is applied to classify the whole papers into research papers with similar subjects, based on the Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) values of each paper.},

The topic model result can be seen as the representation about what kind of information that posted by BMKG through Twitter. In addition, it can also illustrate the weather, climate, and disaster trends that occurred in Java Island. Based on the topic modeling result, we found five notable topics from BMKG's Twitter accounts. As for the topics discussed, BMKG's Twitter accounts disseminate the information about weather Information and weather forecast; latest weather information in Yogyakarta Region; weather forecast and warning in Central Java and West Java; earthquake information; latest articles and calendar cropping information. In this study, we also illustrated the trends about weather and disaster by analyzing the most frequent words from each region in Java.},

The proposed system,considering no grammar, achieves competitive results in online math expression recognition domain.},

@article{phan_2018_augmented_incremental_recognition_of_online_handwritten_mathematical_expressions,
	abstract = {This paper presents an augmented incremental recognition method for online handwritten mathematical expressions (MEs). If an ME is recognized after all strokes are written (batch recognition), the waiting time increases significantly when the ME becomes longer. On the other hand, the pure incremental recognition method recognizes an ME whenever a new single stroke is input. It shortens the waiting time but degrades the recognition rate due to the limited context. Thus, we propose an augmented incremental recognition method that not only maintains the advantage of the two methods but also reduces their weaknesses. The proposed method has two main features: one is to process the latest stroke, and the other is to find the erroneous segmentations and recognitions in the recent strokes and correct them. In the first process, the segmentation and the recognition by Cocke--Younger--Kasami (CYK) algorithm are only executed for the latest stroke. In the second process, all the previous segmentations are updated if they are significantly changed after the latest stroke is input, and then, all the symbols related to the updated segmentations are updated with their recognition scores. These changes are reflected in the CYK table. In addition, the waiting time is further reduced by employing multi-thread processes. Experiments on our dataset and the CROHME datasets show the effectiveness of this augmented incremental recognition method, which not only maintains recognition rate even compared with the batch recognition method but also reduces the waiting time to a very small level.},

@article{onan_2017_hybrid_supervised_clustering_based_ensemble_scheme_for_text_classification,
	abstract = {Purpose The immense quantity of available unstructured text documents serve as one of the largest source of information. Text classification can be an essential task for many purposes in information retrieval, such as document organization, text filtering and sentiment analysis. Ensemble learning has been extensively studied to construct efficient text classification schemes with higher predictive performance and generalization ability. The purpose of this paper is to provide diversity among the classification algorithms of ensemble, which is a key issue in the ensemble design. Design/methodology/approach An ensemble scheme based on hybrid supervised clustering is presented for text classification. In the presented scheme, supervised hybrid clustering, which is based on cuckoo search algorithm and k-means, is introduced to partition the data samples of each class into clusters so that training subsets with higher diversities can be provided. Each classifier is trained on the diversified training subsets and the predictions of individual classifiers are combined by the majority voting rule. The predictive performance of the proposed classifier ensemble is compared to conventional classification algorithms (such as Na{\"\i}ve Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines and C4.5 algorithm) and ensemble learning methods (such as AdaBoost, bagging and random subspace) using 11 text benchmarks. Findings The experimental results indicate that the presented classifier ensemble outperforms the conventional classification algorithms and ensemble learning methods for text classification. Originality/value The presented ensemble scheme is the first to use supervised clustering to obtain diverse ensemble for text classification},

	abstract = {Designing systems for/with marginalized populations requires innovation and the integration of sophisticated domain knowledge with emergent technologies and trends. Researchers need to be cognizant of existing research trends when aspiring to design interventions to build on current and emergent needs. Traditional manual mechanisms for revealing developments in a field, such as systematic literature reviews (SLRs), cannot meet this challenge because they are time and effort intensive and the domain itself is dynamic and ever expanding. This compromises the efficacy of SLRs in keeping up with the growing academic literature. A number of emergent technologies and modern methods exist that could be harnessed to make it possible to monitor the field more effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we propose the use of natural language processing (NLP), an AI-powered text analysis technique that operates efficiently and requires limited human intervention. To investigate the use and usefulness of NLP for identifying research themes, we applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic modelling technique that uses a probabilistic model to find the co-occurrence patterns of terms that correspond to semantic topics. We applied it to a collection of 176 articles published in the Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D) field. We demonstrate the usefulness of the LDA method by comparing the findings of the LDA analysis to those of a manual analysis carried out by researchers. While NLP techniques may not be able to replace SLRs at this stage, we share some insights on how NLP techniques can complement SLRs to offset investigator bias and save time and effort in revealing emerging domain-related themes.},

@inproceedings{alrashdi_2020_robust_domain_adaptation_approach_for_tweet_classification_for_crisis_response,
	abstract = {Information posted by people on Twitter during crises can significantly improve crisis response towards reducing human and financial loss. Deep learning algorithms can identify related tweets to reduce information overloaded which prevents humanitarian organizations from using Twitter posts. However, they heavily rely on labeled data which is unavailable for emerging crises. And because each crisis has its own features such as location, occurring time and social media response, current models are known to suffer from generalizing to unseen disaster events when pretrained on past ones. To solve this problem, we propose a domain adaptation approach that makes use of a distant supervision-based framework to label the unlabeled data from emerging crises. Then, pseudo-labeled target data, along with labeled-data from similar past disasters, are used to build the target model. Our results show that our approach can be seen as a general robust method to classify unseen tweets from current events.},

However, hand-labeled training data is expensive to produce, in low coverage of event types, and limited in size, which makes supervised methods hard to extract large scale of events for knowledge base population. To solve the data labeling problem, we propose to automatically label training data for event extraction via world knowledge and linguistic knowledge, which can detect key arguments and trigger words for each event type and employ them to label events in texts automatically. The experimental results show that the quality of our large scale automatically labeled data is competitive with elaborately human-labeled data. And our automatically labeled data can incorporate with human-labeled data, then improve the performance of models learned from these data.},

A search for pre-existing annotated corpora in Brazilian Portuguese was applied, founding six corpora of which one has been selected as the training dataset. A set of tweets was collected in a specific area of Recife (Pernambuco-Brazil) using some keywords related to kinds of crimes and reinforcing some places in that area. Preprocessing tasks were applied over the pre-existing corpus and the tweets' set collected. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was applied for topic modeling followed by Multinomial Na{\"\i}ve Bayes, Linear Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression for the sentiment polarity classification. The results of the cross-validation of the experiment indicated Linear Support Vector Machines as the most accurate classification method among the three considering the specific training set used, and by this method, the new annotated corpus about the selected topic related to public security was created.},

@article{madichetty_2020_classifying_informative_and_non_informative_tweets_from_the_twitter_by_adapting_image_features_during_disaster,
	abstract = {During the crisis, people post a large number of informative and non-informative tweets on Twitter. Informative tweets provide helpful information such as affected individuals, infrastructure damage, availability and resource requirements, etc. In contrast, non-informative tweets do not provide helpful information related to either humanitarian organizations or victims. Identifying informative tweets is a challenging task during the disaster. People often post images along with text on Twitter during the disaster. In addition to tweet text features, image features are also crucial for identifying informative tweets. However, existing methods use only text features but do not use image features to identify crisis-related tweets during the disaster. This paper proposes a novel approach by considering the image features along with the text features. It includes a text-based classification model, an image-based classification model and a late fusion. The text-based classification model uses the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). CNN is used to extract text features from a tweet and the ANN is used to classify tweets based on extracted text features of CNN. The image-based classification model uses the fine-tuned VGG-16 architecture to extract the image features from the image and classify the image in a tweet. The output of the text-based classification model and the image-based classification model are combined using the late fusion technique to predict the tweet label. Extensive experiments are carried out on Twitter datasets of various crises, such as the Mexico earthquake, California Wildfires, etc., to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various parameters to identify informative tweets during the disaster.},

@article{chauhan_2017_prediction_of_places_of_visit_using_tweets,
	abstract = {We study the problem of predicting likely places of visit of users using their past tweets. What people write on their microblogs reflects their intent and desire relating to most of their common day interests. Taking this as a strong evidence, we hypothesize that tweets of the person can also be treated as source of strong indicator signals for predicting their places of visits. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for predicting place of visit within a given geospatial range considering the past tweets and the time of visit. These predictions can be used for generating places recommendation or for promotions. In this approach, we analyze use of various features that can be extracted from the historical tweets---for example, personality traits estimated from the past tweets and the actual words mentioned in the tweets. We performed extensive empirical experiments involving, real data derived from twitter timelines of 4600 persons with multi-label classification as predictive model. The performances of proposed approach outperform the four baselines with accuracy reaching 90 {\%} for top five predictions. Based on our experimental study, we come up with general guidelines on building the prediction model in terms of the type of features extracted from historical tweets, window size of historical tweets and on the optimal radius of query around the place of visit at a given time.},

@article{chen_2020_a_dirichlet_process_biterm_based_mixture_model_for_short_text_stream_clustering,
	abstract = {Short text stream clustering has become an important problem for mining textual data in diverse social media platforms (e.g., Twitter). However, most of the existing clustering methods (e.g., LDA and PLSA) are developed based on the assumption of a static corpus of long texts, while little attention has been given to short text streams. Different from the long texts, the clustering of short texts is more challenging since their word co-occurrence pattern easily suffers from a sparsity problem. In this paper, we propose a Dirichlet process biterm-based mixture model (DP-BMM), which can deal with the topic drift problem and the sparsity problem in short text stream clustering. The major advantages of DP-BMM include (1) DP-BMM explicitly exploits the word-pairs constructed from each document to enhance the word co-occurrence pattern in short texts; (2) DP-BMM can deal with the topic drift problem of short text streams naturally. Moreover, we further propose an improved algorithm of DP-BMM with forgetting property called DP-BMM-FP, which can efficiently delete biterms of outdated documents by deleting clusters of outdated batches. To perform inference, we adopt an online Gibbs sampling method for parameter estimation. Our extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that DP-BMM and DP-BMM-FP can achieve a better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of NMI metrics.},

@article{he_2020_targeted_aspects_oriented_topic_modeling_for_short_texts,
	abstract = {Topic modeling has demonstrated its value in short text topic discovery. For this task, a common way adopted by many topic models is to perform a full analysis to find all the possible topics. However, these topic models overlook the importance of deeper topics, leading to confusing topics discovered. In practice, people always tend to find more focused topics on some special aspects (or events), rather than a set of coarse topics. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method, Targeted Aspects Oriented Topic Modeling (TATM), to discover more focused topics on specific aspects in short texts. Specifically, each short text is assigned to only one targeted aspect derived from an enhanced Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture process (E-DMM). This process helps group similar words as many as possible, which achieves topic homogeneity. In addition, TATM discovers the topics for each targeted aspect from as many angles as possible by performing target-level modeling, which achieves topic completeness. Thus, TATM can make a balance between the two conflicting properties without employing any additional information or pre-trained knowledge. The extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can effectively discover more focused and complete topics, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

In doing so, a direction vector is introduced for each word, whose embedding is thus learned by not only word co-occurrence patterns in its context, but also the directions of its contextual words. Theoretical and empirical studies on complexity illustrate that our model can be trained as efficient as the original skip-gram model, when compared to other extensions of the skip-gram model. Experimental results show that our model outperforms others on different datasets in semantic (word similarity measurement) and syntactic (part-of-speech tagging) evaluations, respectively.},

@inproceedings{kumar_2018_identifying_singleton_spammers_via_spammer_group_detection,
	abstract = {Opinion spam is a well-recognized threat to the credibility of online reviews. Existing approaches to detecting spam reviews or spammers examine review content, reviewer behavior and reviewer-product network, and often operate on the assumption that spammers write at least several if not many fake reviews. On the other hand, spammers setup multiple sockpuppet IDs and write one-time, singleton spam reviews to avoid detection. It is reported that for most review sites, a large portion, sometimes over 90{\%}, of reviewers are singletons (identified by the reviewer ID). Singleton spammers are difficult to catch due to the scarcity of behavioral clues. In this paper, we argue that the key to detect singleton spammers (and their fake reviews) is to detect group spam attacks by inferring the hidden collusiveness among them. To address the challenge of lack of explicit behavioral signals for singleton reviewers, we propose to infer the hidden reviewer-product associations by completing the review-product matrix by leveraging the product and review metadata and text. Experiments on three real-life Yelp datasets established that our approach can effectively detect singleton spammers via group detection, which are often missed by existing approaches.},

Inspired by the concept of user schema in social psychology, we take a new perspective to perform user representation learning by constructing a shared latent space to capture the dependency among different modalities of user-generated data. Both users and topics are embedded to the same space to encode users' social connections and text content, to facilitate joint modeling of different modalities, via a probabilistic generative framework. We evaluated the proposed solution on large collections of Yelp reviews and StackOverflow discussion posts, with their associated network structures. The proposed model outperformed several state-of-the-art topic modeling based user models with better predictive power in unseen documents, and state-of-the-art network embedding based user models with improved link prediction quality in unseen nodes. The learnt user representations are also proved to be useful in content recommendation, e.g., expert finding in StackOverflow.},

@article{shanavas_2021_knowledge_driven_graph_similarity_for_text_classification,
	abstract = {Automatic text classification using machine learning is significantly affected by the text representation model. The structural information in text is necessary for natural language understanding, which is usually ignored in vector-based representations. In this paper, we present a graph kernel-based text classification framework which utilises the structural information in text effectively through the weighting and enrichment of a graph-based representation. We introduce weighted co-occurrence graphs to represent text documents, which weight the terms and their dependencies based on their relevance to text classification. We propose a novel method to automatically enrich the weighted graphs using semantic knowledge in the form of a word similarity matrix. The similarity between enriched graphs, knowledge-driven graph similarity, is calculated using a graph kernel. The semantic knowledge in the enriched graphs ensures that the graph kernel goes beyond exact matching of terms and patterns to compute the semantic similarity of documents. In the experiments on sentiment classification and topic classification tasks, our knowledge-driven similarity measure significantly outperforms the baseline text similarity measures on five benchmark text classification datasets.},

@inproceedings{gao_2018_large_scale_learnable_graph_convolutional_networks,
	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success on grid-like data such as images, but face tremendous challenges in learning from more generic data such as graphs. In CNNs, the trainable local filters enable the automatic extraction of high-level features. The computation with filters requires a fixed number of ordered units in the receptive fields. However, the number of neighboring units is neither fixed nor are they ordered in generic graphs, thereby hindering the applications of convolutional operations. Here, we address these challenges by proposing the learnable graph convolutional layer (LGCL). LGCL automatically selects a fixed number of neighboring nodes for each feature based on value ranking in order to transform graph data into grid-like structures in 1-D format, thereby enabling the use of regular convolutional operations on generic graphs. To enable model training on large-scale graphs, we propose a sub-graph training method to reduce the excessive memory and computational resource requirements suffered by prior methods on graph convolutions. Our experimental results on node classification tasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that our methods can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network datasets. Our results also indicate that the proposed methods using sub-graph training strategy are more efficient as compared to prior approaches.},

@inproceedings{long_2020_graph_structural_topic_neural_network,
	abstract = {Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) achieved tremendous success by effectively gathering local features for nodes. However, commonly do GCNs focus more on node features but less on graph structures within the neighborhood, especially higher-order structural patterns. However, such local structural patterns are shown to be indicative of node properties in numerous fields. In addition, it is not just single patterns, but the distribution over all these patterns matter, because networks are complex and the neighborhood of each node consists of a mixture of various nodes and structural patterns. Correspondingly, in this paper, we propose Graph Structural topic Neural Network, abbreviated GraphSTONE 1, a GCN model that utilizes topic models of graphs, such that the structural topics capture indicative graph structures broadly from a probabilistic aspect rather than merely a few structures. Specifically, we build topic models upon graphs using anonymous walks and Graph Anchor LDA, an LDA variant that selects significant structural patterns first, so as to alleviate the complexity and generate structural topics efficiently. In addition, we design multi-view GCNs to unify node features and structural topic features and utilize structural topics to guide the aggregation. We evaluate our model through both quantitative and qualitative experiments, where our model exhibits promising performance, high efficiency, and clear interpretability.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical multi-label text classification (HMTC) aims to tag each document with a set of classes from a taxonomic class hierarchy. Most existing HMTC methods train classifiers using massive human-labeled documents, which are often too costly to obtain in real-world applications. In this paper, we explore to conduct HMTC based on only class surface names as supervision signals. We observe that to perform HMTC, human experts typically first pinpoint a few most essential classes for the document as its {``}core classes{''}, and then check core classes{'} ancestor classes to ensure the coverage. To mimic human experts, we propose a novel HMTC framework, named TaxoClass. Specifically, TaxoClass (1) calculates document-class similarities using a textual entailment model, (2) identifies a document{'}s core classes and utilizes confident core classes to train a taxonomy-enhanced classifier, and (3) generalizes the classifier via multi-label self-training. Our experiments on two challenging datasets show TaxoClass can achieve around 0.71 Example-F1 using only class names, outperforming the best previous method by 25{\%}.},

@article{mubin_2018_an_assessment_into_the_characteristics_of_award_winning_papers_at_chi,
	abstract = {The overall readability of CHI publications is not known. In addition, little is understood about what lexical or demographic characteristics are unique to award winning papers at CHI and if they are significantly different from non award winning papers. We therefore carry out an exploration and assessment into the readability metrics as well as a meta analysis of 382 full papers and 54 notes from the 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 editions at CHI. Our results illustrate that notes did not have any significant trends whatsoever. On the other hand, award winning full papers were shown to have lower readability as compared to non award winning full papers. The type of research contribution played an important role; such that award winning full papers were significantly more likely to have a theoretical contribution as compared to non award winning full papers and full papers that presented an artifact as their contribution were more readable than other full papers. Our demographic analysis of authors indicated that the experience of authors nor their region of affiliation were not associated with the likelihood of their full paper being awarded. The experience of authors did not effect the overall readability of full papers however the region of affiliation did have a significant influence on the overall readability of full papers. In conclusion, we speculate on our obtained results through linkages with prior work in readability analysis.},

@article{thomas_2018_gradient_boosting_for_distributional_regression_faster_tuning_and_improved_variable_selection_via_noncyclical_updates,
	abstract = {We present a new algorithm for boosting generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) that allows to incorporate stability selection, an increasingly popular way to obtain stable sets of covariates while controlling the per-family error rate. The model is fitted repeatedly to subsampled data, and variables with high selection frequencies are extracted. To apply stability selection to boosted GAMLSS, we develop a new ``noncyclical''fitting algorithm that incorporates an additional selection step of the best-fitting distribution parameter in each iteration. This new algorithm has the additional advantage that optimizing the tuning parameters of boosting is reduced from a multi-dimensional to a one-dimensional problem with vastly decreased complexity. The performance of the novel algorithm is evaluated in an extensive simulation study. We apply this new algorithm to a study to estimate abundance of common eider in Massachusetts, USA, featuring excess zeros, overdispersion, nonlinearity and spatiotemporal structures. Eider abundance is estimated via boosted GAMLSS, allowing both mean and overdispersion to be regressed on covariates. Stability selection is used to obtain a sparse set of stable predictors.},

We first provide a framework of how to describe and distinguish approaches to topic extraction from bibliographic data of scientific publications. We then compare solutions delivered by the different topic extraction approaches in this special issue, and explore where they agree and differ. This is achieved without reference to a ground truth, since we have to assume the existence of multiple, equally important, valid perspectives and want to avoid bias through the adoption of an ad-hoc yardstick. Instead, we apply different ways to quantitatively and visually compare solutions to explore their commonalities and differences and develop hypotheses about the origin of these differences. We conclude with a discussion of future work needed to develop methods for comparison and validation of topic extraction results, and express our concern about the lack of access to non-proprietary benchmark data sets to support method development in the field of scientometrics.},

	abstract = {How is community forestry (CF) research changing as CF policies mature around the world? In this research note we use bibliometrics and topic modelling to display trends in the geographic foci and research topics mentioned in the abstracts of CF-related research papers published between 1990 and 2017. We find that studies of CF in South Asia make up a substantial proportion of the literature, although CF research in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America has also developed. Using a structural topic model, we identify four major research areas and 20 topics latent in the text of the abstracts analyzed. The trends of topic proportions over time offer evidence of a shift in research focus from broad policy analysis to local outcomes and growing interest in carbon sequestration. Results identify the most prominent CF research topics and demonstrate the potential of topic models to analyze large amounts of scientific literature.},

@article{zeng_2019_increasing_trend_of_scientists_to_switch_between_topics,
	abstract = {Despite persistent efforts in understanding the creativity of scientists over different career stages, little is known about the underlying dynamics of research topic switching that drives innovation. Here, we analyze the publication records of individual scientists, aiming to quantify their topic switching dynamics and its influence. We find that the co-citing network of papers of a scientist exhibits a clear community structure where each major community represents a research topic. Our analysis suggests that scientists have a narrow distribution of number of topics. However, researchers nowadays switch more frequently between topics than those in the early days. We also find that high switching probability in early career is associated with low overall productivity, yet with high overall productivity in latter career. Interestingly, the average citation per paper, however, is in all career stages negatively correlated with the switching probability. We propose a model that can explain the main observed features.},

However, there is limited knowledge and academic consensus regarding the abilities and knowledge a child or young person should possess for making sound health decisions. The research presented in this review addresses this gap by providing an overview and synthesis of current understandings of health literacy in childhood and youth.

@article{hu_2018_measuring_the_interdisciplinarity_of_big_data_research_a_longitudinal_study,
	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to measure the degree of interdisciplinary collaboration in Big Data research based on the co-occurrences of subject categories using Stirling's diversity index and specialization index. Design/methodology/approach Interdisciplinarity was measured utilizing the descriptive statistics of disciplines, network indicators showing relationships between disciplines and within individual disciplines, interdisciplinary communities, Stirling's diversity index and specialization index, and a strategic diagram revealing the development status and trends of discipline communities. Findings Comprehensively considering all results, the degree of interdisciplinarity of Big Data research is increasing over time, particularly, after 2013. There is a high level of interdisciplinarity in Big Data research involving a large number of disciplines, but it is unbalanced in distribution. The interdisciplinary collaborations are not intensive on the whole; most disciplines are aggregated into a few distinct communities with computer science, business and economics, mathematics, and biotechnology and applied microbiology as the core. Four major discipline communities in Big Data research represent different directions with different development statuses and trends. Community 1, with computer science as the core, is the most mature and central to the whole interdisciplinary network. Accounting for all network indicators, computer science, engineering, business and economics, social sciences, and mathematics are the most important disciplines in Big Data research. Originality/value This study deepens our understanding of the degree and trend of interdisciplinary collaboration in Big Data research through a longitudinal study and quantitative measures based on two indexes. It has practical implications to study and reveal the interdisciplinary phenomenon and characteristics of related developments of a specific research area, or to conduct comparative studies between different research areas.},

@article{leydesdorff_2018_betweenness_and_diversity_in_journal_citation_networks_as_measures_of_interdisciplinarity___a_tribute_to_eugene_garfield,
	abstract = {Journals were central to Eugene Garfield's research interests. Among other things, journals are considered as units of analysis for bibliographic databases such as the Web of Science and Scopus. In addition to providing a basis for disciplinary classifications of journals, journal citation patterns span networks across boundaries to variable extents. Using betweenness centrality (BC) and diversity, we elaborate on the question of how to distinguish and rank journals in terms of interdisciplinarity. Interdisciplinarity, however, is difficult to operationalize in the absence of an operational definition of disciplines; the diversity of a unit of analysis is sample-dependent. BC can be considered as a measure of multi-disciplinarity. Diversity of co-citation in a citing document has been considered as an indicator of knowledge integration, but an author can also generate trans-disciplinary---that is, non-disciplined---variation by citing sources from other disciplines. Diversity in the bibliographic coupling among citing documents can analogously be considered as diffusion  or differentiation of knowledge across disciplines. Because the citation networks in the cited direction reflect both structure and variation, diversity in this direction is perhaps the best available measure of interdisciplinarity at the journal level. Furthermore, diversity is based on a summation and can therefore be decomposed; differences among (sub)sets can be tested for statistical significance. In the appendix, a general-purpose routine for measuring diversity in networks is provided.},

We look at variants of the model in which directed edges are added to the new vertex in one of two ways: using cumulative advantage (preferential attachment) choosing vertices in proportion to their degree, or with random attachment in which vertices are chosen uniformly at random. In such networks, the longest path is well defined and in some cases is known to be a better approximation to geodesics than the shortest path. We define a reverse greedy path and show both analytically and numerically that this scales with the logarithm of the size of the network with a coefficient given by the number of edges added using random attachment. This is a lower bound on the length of the longest path to any given vertex and we show numerically that the longest path also scales with the logarithm of the size of the network but with a larger coefficient that has some weak dependence on the parameters of the model.},

@article{yu_2020_knowledge_diffusion_paths_of_blockchain_domain_the_main_path_analysis,
	abstract = {Blockchain technology, as a disruptive technology, has received widespread attention in the past few years from all over the world, leading to rapid growth in research outputs. This paper adopts a quantitative method, the main path analysis, to comprehensively and systematically investigate the development trajectories of blockchain. Four different main paths, the global main path, the forward local main path, the backward local main path and the key-route main path are conducted simultaneously. By analyzing these various paths, on the one hand, this paper finds that papers on paths focus on two aspects, cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based applications. On the other hand, this paper discovers several major research areas of blockchain, including internet of things (IoT), healthcare, energy industry, voting, insurance and supply chain management. At the same time, this paper further analyzes the research hotspots, as well as the development trajectories of blockchain in the areas of IoT, healthcare and supply chain management by using the key-route main path analysis. This paper is conductive for both the new and experienced researchers to identify some influential papers and grasp the knowledge diffusion paths in these domains.},

@article{lathabai_2018_an_integrated_approach_to_path_analysis_for_weighted_citation_networks,
	abstract = {Profuse growth of scientometrics as a research field owes a discernible attribution to the introduction of citation networks and other scientograms. Centrality analysis, path analysis and cluster analysis are three major network analysis tools. Hummon and Doreian's introduction of path retrieval methods based on (1) traversal count as weight assignment (for arcs) method and (2) search methods such as local (forward) search and global search, marked the commencement of path analysis. Original Hummon--Doreian traversal count based weight assignment methods such as Search Path Link Count and Search Path Node Pair were computationally complex. Along with the computational improvement of these weights, Batagelj added another computationally efficient traversal count method to the path analysis literature known as Search Path Count. A major development in search methods was seen recently with the introduction of innovative search methods such as backward (local) search and key-route (local and global) search by Liu and Lu. They also powered the available and new local search methods with a parameter to control the search. Major advantage of Liu--Lu methods lies in the fact that these can reveal more paths or more papers that are usually missed out in classical methods. All these contributions considered unweighted citation networks as the object of analysis. Despite being a tool of tremendous potential, path analysis is much underexplored relative to other network analysis tools. Inspired by these, we generalise Liu--Lu integrated approach, the present state-of-art in path analysis to an integrated approach for weighted networks. We demonstrate a manifold improvement in analysis opportunities with the generalized integrated approach using FV gradient weights for weight assignment, on a case study of the field `IT for engineering'. Integrated approach for weighted networks do not need additional implementation effort in PAJEK and this will be beneficial for a multitude of analysts and decision makers.},

As compared to the MSDF methods in the sensor and other fields, and considering the features of scientometrics, in this paper an application model and procedure of MSDF in scientometrics are proposed. The model and procedure can be divided into three parts: data type integration, fusion of data relations, and ensemble clustering. Furthermore, the fusion of data relations can be divided into cross-integration of multi-mode data and matrix fusion of multi-relational data. To obtain a clearer and deeper analysis of the MSDF model, this paper further focuses on the application of MSDF in topic identification based on text analysis of scientific literatures. This paper also discusses the application of MSDF for the exploration of scientific literatures. Finally, the most suitable MSDF methods for different situations are discussed.},

In the course of these developments, a concern emerged and is steadily growing. Do the sets of publications, authors or institutions we identify and visualise with our methods indeed represent thematic structures? To what extent are results of topic identification exercises determined by properties of knowledge structures, and to what extent are they determined by the approaches we use? Do we produce more than artefacts? These questions triggered the collective process of comparative topic identification reported in this special issue. The introduction traces the history of bibliometric approaches to topic identification, identifies the major challenges involved in these exercises, and introduces the contributions to the special issue.},

Our previous scientometric review of IS provided a snapshot of this fast-growing field up to the end of 2008. This new study aims to identify emerging trends and new developments appearing in the subsequent 7574 articles published in 10 IS journals between 2009 and 2016, including 20,960 references. The results of a document co-citation analysis show great changes in the research topics in the IS domain. The positions of certain core topics found in the previous study, namely, information retrieval, webometrics, and citation behavior, have been replaced by scientometric indicators (H-index), citation analysis (citation performance and bibliometrics), scientific collaboration, and information behavior in the most recent period of 2009--2016. Dual-map overlays of journals show that the knowledge base of IS research has shifted considerably since 2010, with emerging topics including scientific evaluation indicators, altmetrics, science mapping and visualization, bibliometrics, citation analysis, and scientific collaboration.},

The opportunity automatically to capture the sentiments of the general public about social events, political movements, marketing campaigns, and product preferences, in fact, has raised increasing interest both in the scientific community, for the exciting open challenges, and in the business world, for the remarkable fallouts in marketing and financial market prediction. This has led to the emerging fields of affective computing and sentiment analysis, which leverage on human-computer interaction, information retrieval, and multimodal signal processing for distilling people's sentiments from the ever-growing amount of online social data.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study an important yet largely under-explored setting of graph embedding, i.e., embedding communities instead of each individual nodes. We find that community embedding is not only useful for community-level applications such as graph visualization, but also beneficial to both community detection and node classification. To learn such embedding, our insight hinges upon a closed loop among community embedding, community detection and node embedding. On the one hand, node embedding can help improve community detection, which outputs good communities for fitting better community embedding. On the other hand, community embedding can be used to optimize the node embedding by introducing a community-aware high-order proximity. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel community embedding framework that jointly solves the three tasks together. We evaluate such a framework on multiple real-world datasets, and show that it improves graph visualization and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various application tasks, e.g., community detection and node classification.},

According to recent social statistics, we have more than 930 million people are using WhatsApp with more than 340 million active daily users and 955 million people who access Facebook daily with an average daily photo uploads up to 325 million. The approach presented in this paper employs the collaborative tagging accumulated by huge number of users to improve social media recommendation. Our approach has two phases, in the first phase, we compute the tag-item weight model and in the second phase, we compute the user-tag preference model. After that we employ the two models to find the suitable items tailored to the user's preferences and recommend the items with the highest score. Also our model can compute the tag score and suggest the tags with the highest weight to the user according to their preferences. The experiment results performed on Flicker and MovieLens prove that our approach is capable to improve the social media recommendation.},

@article{zhang_2017_processing_long_queries_against_short_text_top_k_advertisement_matching_in_news_stream_applications,
	abstract = {Many real applications in real-time news stream advertising call for efficient processing of long queries against short text. In such applications, dynamic news feeds are regarded as queries to match against an advertisement (ad) database for retrieving the k most relevant ads. The existing approaches to keyword retrieval cannot work well in this search scenario when queries are triggered at a very high frequency. To address the problem, we introduce new techniques to significantly improve search performance. First, we devise a two-level partitioning for tight upper bound estimation and a lazy evaluation scheme to delay full evaluation of unpromising candidates, which can bring three to four times performance boosting in a database with 7 million ads. Second, we propose a novel rank-aware block-oriented inverted index to further improve performance. In this index scheme, each entry in an inverted list is assigned a rank according to its importance in the ad. Then, we introduce a block-at-a-time search strategy based on the index scheme to support a much tighter upper bound estimation and a very early termination. We have conducted experiments with real datasets, and the results show that the rank-aware method can further improve performance by an order of magnitude.},

@article{xu_2017_incorporating_wikipedia_concepts_and_categories_as_prior_knowledge_into_topic_models,
	abstractnote = {Topic models have been widely applied in discovering topics that underly a collection of documents. Incorporating human knowledge can guide conventional topic models to produce topics which are easily interpreted and semantically coherent. Several knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, but these models just leverage lexical knowledge of words that are often not in accordance with topics. To solve the problem, we recognize entity mentions, besides words, in the documents and incorporate entity knowledge from external knowledge bases. In this paper, we study to utilize entity knowledge, concepts and categories in Wikipedia, as prior knowledge into topic models to discover more coherent topics. A novel knowledge-based topic model, WCM-LDA (Wikipedia-Category-concept-Mention Latent Dirichlet Allocation), is proposed, which not only models the relationship between words and topics, but also utilizes concept and category knowledge of entities to model the semantic relation of entities and topics. We compare WCM-LDA with the state-of-the-art knowledge-based topic models, on three datasets. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing baseline methods on all three datasets. Moreover, our model can visualize topics with top words, concepts and categories such that topics are made easily to be interpreted and classified.},

@inproceedings{khani_2018_context_aware_trustworthy_service_evaluation_in_social_internet_of_things,
	abstract = {In Social Internet of Things (SIoT) environments, a large number of users and Internet of Things (IoT) based devices are connected to each other, so that they can share SIoT-based services. IoT-based devices establish social relations with each other according to the social relations of their owners in Online Social Networks (OSNs). In such an environment, a big challenge is how to provide trustworthy service evaluation. Currently, the prevalent trust management mechanisms consider QoS-based trust and social-relation based trust mechanisms in evaluating the trustworthiness of service providers. However, the existing trust management mechanisms in SIoT environments do not consider the different contexts of trust. Therefore, dishonest SIoT devices, based on their owners' social relations, can succeed in advertising low-quality services or exploiting maliciously provided services. In this paper, we first propose three contexts of trust in SIoT environments including the status and environment (time and location) of devices, and the types of tasks. Then, we propose a novel Mutual Context-aware Trustworthy Service Evaluation (MCTSE) model. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed contextual trust evaluation model can effectively differentiate honest and dishonest devices and provide a high success rate in selecting the most trustworthy services and providing high resilience against different attacks from dishonest devices.},

Automatic topic labelling is the task of generating a succinct label that summarises the theme or subject of a topic, with the intention of reducing the cognitive load of end-users when interpreting these topics. Traditionally, topic label systems focus on a single label modality, e.g. textual labels. In this work we propose a multimodal approach to topic labelling using a simple feedforward neural network. Given a topic and a candidate image or textual label, our method automatically generates a rating for the label, relative to the topic. Experiments show that this multimodal approach outperforms single-modality topic labelling systems.},

	abstract = {Determining appropriate statistical distributions for modeling text corpora is important for accurate estimation of numerical characteristics. Based on the validity of the test on a claim that the data conforms to Poisson distribution we propose Poisson decomposition model (PDM), a statistical model for modeling count data of text corpora, which can straightly capture each document's multidimensional numerical characteristics on topics. In PDM, each topic is represented as a parameter vector with multidimensional Poisson distribution, which can be easily normalized to multinomial term probabilities and each document is represented as measurements on topics and thereby reduced to a measurement vector on topics. We use gradient descent methods and sampling algorithm for parameter estimation. We carry out extensive experiments on the topics produced by our models. The results demonstrate our approach can extract more coherent topics and is competitive in document clustering by using the PDM-based features, compared to PLSI and LDA.},

	abstract = {Aspect extraction is an important and challenging task in aspect-based sentiment analysis. Existing works tend to apply variants of topic models on this task. While fairly successful, these methods usually do not produce highly coherent aspects. In this paper, we present a novel neural approach with the aim of discovering coherent aspects. The model improves coherence by exploiting the distribution of word co-occurrences through the use of neural word embeddings. Unlike topic models which typically assume independently generated words, word embedding models encourage words that appear in similar contexts to be located close to each other in the embedding space. In addition, we use an attention mechanism to de-emphasize irrelevant words during training, further improving the coherence of aspects. Experimental results on real-life datasets demonstrate that our approach discovers more meaningful and coherent aspects, and substantially outperforms baseline methods on several evaluation tasks.},

@inproceedings{he_2018_effective_attention_modeling_for_aspect_level_sentiment_classification,
	abstract = {Aspect-level sentiment classification aims to determine the sentiment polarity of a review sentence towards an opinion target. A sentence could contain multiple sentiment-target pairs; thus the main challenge of this task is to separate different opinion contexts for different targets. To this end, attention mechanism has played an important role in previous state-of-the-art neural models. The mechanism is able to capture the importance of each context word towards a target by modeling their semantic associations. We build upon this line of research and propose two novel approaches for improving the effectiveness of attention. First, we propose a method for target representation that better captures the semantic meaning of the opinion target. Second, we introduce an attention model that incorporates syntactic information into the attention mechanism. We experiment on attention-based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models using the datasets from SemEval 2014, 2015, and 2016.

@inproceedings{wang_2020_neural_topic_modeling_with_bidirectional_adversarial_training,
	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a surge of interests of using neural topic models for automatic topic extraction from text, since they avoid the complicated mathematical derivations for model inference as in traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). However, these models either typically assume improper prior (e.g. Gaussian or Logistic Normal) over latent topic space or could not infer topic distribution for a given document. To address these limitations, we propose a neural topic modeling approach, called Bidirectional Adversarial Topic (BAT) model, which represents the first attempt of applying bidirectional adversarial training for neural topic modeling. The proposed BAT builds a two-way projection between the document-topic distribution and the document-word distribution. It uses a generator to capture the semantic patterns from texts and an encoder for topic inference. Furthermore, to incorporate word relatedness information, the Bidirectional Adversarial Topic model with Gaussian (Gaussian-BAT) is extended from BAT. To verify the effectiveness of BAT and Gaussian-BAT, three benchmark corpora are used in our experiments. The experimental results show that BAT and Gaussian-BAT obtain more coherent topics, outperforming several competitive baselines. Moreover, when performing text clustering based on the extracted topics, our models outperform all the baselines, with more significant improvements achieved by Gaussian-BAT where an increase of near 6{\%} is observed in accuracy.},

To generate label-specific topics, several supervised topic models which adopt likelihood-driven objective functions have been proposed. However, it is hard for them to get a precise estimation on both topic discovery and supervised learning. In this study, we propose a supervised topic model based on the Siamese network, which can trade off label-specific word distributions with document-specific label distributions in a uniform framework. Experiments on real-world datasets validate that our model performs competitive in topic discovery quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, the proposed model can effectively predict categorical or real-valued labels for new documents by generating word embeddings from a label-specific topical space.},

Unlike existing variational autoencoder based models, we directly enforce Dirichlet prior on the latent document-topic vectors. We exploit the structure of the latent space and apply a suitable kernel in minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to perform distribution matching. We discover that MMD performs much better than the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in matching high dimensional Dirichlet distribution. We further discover that incorporating randomness in the encoder output during training leads to significantly more coherent topics. To measure the diversity of the produced topics, we propose a simple topic uniqueness metric. Together with the widely used coherence measure NPMI, we offer a more wholistic evaluation of topic quality. Experiments on several real datasets show that our model produces significantly better topics than existing topic models.},

@inproceedings{guo_2017_understanding_users_budgets_for_recommendation_with_hierarchical_poisson_factorization,
	abstract = {People consume and rate products in online shopping websites. The historical purchases of customers reflect their personal consumption habits and indicate their future shopping behaviors. Traditional preference-based recommender systems try to provide recommendations by analyzing users' feedback such as ratings and clicks. But unfortunately, most of the existing recommendation algorithms ignore the budget of the users. So they cannot avoid recommending users with products that will exceed their budgets. And they also cannot understand how the users will assign their budgets to different products. In this paper, we develop a generative model named collaborative budget-aware Poisson factorization (CBPF) to connect users' ratings and budgets. The CBPF model is intuitive and highly interpretable. We compare the proposed model with several state-of-the-art budget-unaware recommendation methods on several realworld datasets. The results show the advantage of uncovering users' budgets for recommendation.},

@article{condori_2017_opinion_summarization_methods_comparing_and_extending_extractive_and_abstractive_approaches,
	abstract = {In the last years, the opinion summarization task has gained much importance because of the large amount of online information and the increasing interest in learning the user evaluation about products, services, companies, and people. Although there are many works in this area, there is room for improvement, as the results are far from ideal. In this paper, we present our investigations to generate extractive and abstractive summaries of opinions. We study some well-known methods in the area and compare them. Besides using these methods, we also develop new methods that consider the main advantages of the ones before. We evaluate them according to three traditional summarization evaluation measures: informativeness, linguistic quality, and utility of the summary. We show that we produce interesting results and that our methods outperform some methods from literature.},

Our method combines two weakly supervised components to identify salient opinions and form extractive summaries from multiple reviews: an aspect extractor trained under a multi-task objective, and a sentiment predictor based on multiple instance learning. We introduce an opinion summarization dataset that includes a training set of product reviews from six diverse domains and human-annotated development and test sets with gold standard aspect annotations, salience labels, and opinion summaries. Automatic evaluation shows significant improvements over baselines, and a large-scale study indicates that our opinion summaries are preferred by human judges according to multiple criteria.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic topic models are important tools for indexing, summarizing, and analyzing large document collections by their themes. However, promoting end-user understanding of topics remains an open research problem. We compare labels generated by users given four topic visualization techniques{---}word lists, word lists with bars, word clouds, and network graphs{---}against each other and against automatically generated labels. Our basis of comparison is participant ratings of how well labels describe documents from the topic. Our study has two phases: a labeling phase where participants label visualized topics and a validation phase where different participants select which labels best describe the topics{'} documents. Although all visualizations produce similar quality labels, simple visualizations such as word lists allow participants to quickly understand topics, while complex visualizations take longer but expose multi-word expressions that simpler visualizations obscure. Automatic labels lag behind user-created labels, but our dataset of manually labeled topics highlights linguistic patterns (e.g., hypernyms, phrases) that can be used to improve automatic topic labeling algorithms.},

@inproceedings{alokaili_2019_re_ranking_words_to_improve_interpretability_of_automatically_generated_topics,
	abstract = {Topics models, such as LDA, are widely used in Natural Language Processing. Making their output interpretable is an important area of research with applications to areas such as the enhancement of exploratory search interfaces and the development of interpretable machine learning models. Conventionally, topics are represented by their n most probable words, however, these representations are often difficult for humans to interpret. This paper explores the re-ranking of topic words to generate more interpretable topic representations. A range of approaches are compared and evaluated in two experiments. The first uses crowdworkers to associate topics represented by different word rankings with related documents. The second experiment is an automatic approach based on a document retrieval task applied on multiple domains. Results in both experiments demonstrate that re-ranking words improves topic interpretability and that the most effective re-ranking schemes were those which combine information about the importance of words both within topics and their relative frequency in the entire corpus. In addition, close correlation between the results of the two evaluation approaches suggests that the automatic method proposed here could be used to evaluate re-ranking methods without the need for human judgements.},

	abstract = {Advances in unsupervised learning enable reconstruction and generation of samples from complex distributions, but this success is marred by the inscrutability of the representations learned. We propose an information-theoretic approach to characterizing disentanglement and dependence in representation learning using multivariate mutual information, also called total correlation. The principle of Total Cor-relation Ex-planation (CorEx) has motivated successful unsupervised learning applications across a variety of domains but under some restrictive assumptions. Here we relax those restrictions by introducing a flexible variational lower bound to CorEx. Surprisingly, we find this lower bound is equivalent to the one in variational autoencoders (VAE) under certain conditions. This information-theoretic view of VAE deepens our understanding of hierarchical VAE and motivates a new algorithm, AnchorVAE, that makes latent codes more interpretable through information maximization and enables generation of richer and more realistic samples.},

In this work, under a neural variational inference framework, we propose methods to incorporate a topic coherence objective into the training process. We demonstrate that such a coherence-aware topic model exhibits a similar level of perplexity as baseline models but achieves substantially higher topic coherence.},

@inproceedings{wan_2019_fine_grained_spoiler_detection_from_large_scale_review_corpora,
	abstract = {This paper presents computational approaches for automatically detecting critical plot twists in reviews of media products. First, we created a large-scale book review dataset that includes fine-grained spoiler annotations at the sentence-level, as well as book and (anonymized) user information. Second, we carefully analyzed this dataset, and found that: spoiler language tends to be book-specific; spoiler distributions vary greatly across books and review authors; and spoiler sentences tend to jointly appear in the latter part of reviews. Third, inspired by these findings, we developed an end-to-end neural network architecture to detect spoiler sentences in review corpora. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed method substantially outperforms existing baselines.},

@inproceedings{gui_2019_neural_topic_model_with_reinforcement_learning,
	abstract = {In recent years, advances in neural variational inference have achieved many successes in text processing. Examples include neural topic models which are typically built upon variational autoencoder (VAE) with an objective of minimising the error of reconstructing original documents based on the learned latent topic vectors. However, minimising reconstruction errors does not necessarily lead to high quality topics. In this paper, we borrow the idea of reinforcement learning and incorporate topic coherence measures as reward signals to guide the learning of a VAE-based topic model. Furthermore, our proposed model is able to automatically separating background words dynamically from topic words, thus eliminating the pre-processing step of filtering infrequent and/or top frequent words, typically required for learning traditional topic models. Experimental results on the 20 Newsgroups and the NIPS datasets show superior performance both on perplexity and topic coherence measure compared to state-of-the-art neural topic models.},

Our model assumes that a global topic embedding is shared across documents and employs an attention mechanism to derive local topic embedding for words and sentences. These are subsequently incorporated in a modified Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for sentiment classification and extraction of topics bearing different sentiment polarities. Those topics emerge from the words' local topic embeddings learned by the internal attention of the GRU cells in the context of a multi-task learning framework. In this paper, we present the hierarchical architecture, the new GRU unit and the experiments conducted on users' reviews which demonstrate classification performance on a par with the state-of-the-art methodologies for sentiment classification and topic coherence outperforming the current approaches for supervised topic extraction. In addition, our model is able to extract coherent aspect-sentiment clusters despite using no aspect-level annotations for training.},

We experimentally compare 16 commonly used pre-processing techniques on two Twitter datasets for Sentiment Analysis, employing four popular machine learning algorithms, namely, Linear SVC, Bernoulli Na{\"\i}ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Convolutional Neural Networks. We evaluate the pre-processing techniques on their resulting classification accuracy and number of features they produce. We find that techniques like lemmatization, removing numbers, and replacing contractions, improve accuracy, while others like removing punctuation do not. Finally, in order to investigate interactions---desirable or otherwise---between the techniques when they are employed simultaneously in a pipeline fashion, an ablation and combination study is contacted. The results of ablation and combination show the significance of techniques such as replacing numbers and replacing repetitions of punctuation.},

@article{blair_2020_aggregated_topic_models_for_increasing_social_media_topic_coherence,
	abstract = {This research presents a novel aggregating method for constructing an aggregated topic model that is composed of the topics with greater coherence than individual models. When generating a topic model, a number of parameters have to be specified. The resulting topics can be very general or very specific, which depend on the chosen parameters. In this study we investigate the process of aggregating multiple topic models generated using different parameters with a focus on whether combining the general and specific topics is able to increase topic coherence. We employ cosine similarity and Jensen-Shannon divergence to compute the similarity among topics and combine them into an aggregated model when their similarity scores exceed a predefined threshold. The model is evaluated against the standard topics models generated by the latent Dirichlet allocation and Non-negative Matrix Factorisation. Specifically we use the coherence of topics to compare the individual models that create aggregated models against those of the aggregated model and models generated by Non-negative Matrix Factorisation, respectively. The results demonstrate that the aggregated model outperforms those topic models at a statistically significant level in terms of topic coherence over an external corpus. We also make use of the aggregated topic model on social media data to validate the method in a realistic scenario and find that again it outperforms individual topic models.},

	abstract = {To qualitative researchers, social media offers a novel opportunity to harvest a massive and diverse range of content without the need for intrusive or intensive data collection procedures. However, performing a qualitative analysis across a massive social media data set is cumbersome and impractical. Instead, researchers often extract a subset of content to analyze, but a framework to facilitate this process is currently lacking. We present a four-phased framework for improving this extraction process, which blends the capacities of data science techniques to compress large data sets into smaller spaces, with the capabilities of qualitative analysis to address research questions. We demonstrate this framework by investigating the topics of Australian Twitter commentary on climate change, using quantitative (non-negative matrix inter-joint factorization; topic alignment) and qualitative (thematic analysis) techniques. Our approach is useful for researchers seeking to perform qualitative analyses of social media, or researchers wanting to supplement their quantitative work with a qualitative analysis of broader social context and meaning.},

	abstract = {{We replicate and analyze the topic model which was commissioned to King's College and Digital Science for the Research Evaluation Framework (REF 2014) in the United Kingdom: 6,638 case descriptions of societal impact were submitted by 154 higher-education institutes. We compare the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of document-term matrices using the same data. Since topic models are almost by definition applied to text corpora which are too large to read, validation of the results of these models is hardly possible; furthermore the models are irreproducible for a number of reasons. However, removing a small fraction of the documents from the sample---a test for reliability---has on average a larger impact in terms of decay on LDA than on PCA-based models. The semantic coherence of LDA models outperforms PCA-based models. In our opinion, results of the topic models are statistical and should not be used for grant selections and micro decision-making about research without follow-up using domain-specific semantic maps.}},

@article{karami_2018_characterizing_diabetes_diet_exercise_and_obesity_comments_on_twitter,
	abstract = {Social media provide a platform for users to express their opinions and share information. Understanding public health opinions on social media, such as Twitter, offers a unique approach to characterizing common health issues such as diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity (DDEO); however, collecting and analyzing a large scale conversational public health data set is a challenging research task. The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of the general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity (DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8% of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity. The strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and obesity (p<.0002). Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity (p<.0005), and diet and obesity (p<.001). DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with ``Diabetes'', excluding the DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer. The non-DDEO subtopics for ``Diet'' included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities, weight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for ``Exercise'' included computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for ``Obesity'' included Alzheimer, cancer, and children. With 2.67 billion social media users in 2016, publicly available data such as Twitter posts can be utilized to support clinical providers, public health experts, and social scientists in better understanding common public opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity.},

@article{korencic_2018_document_based_topic_coherence_measures_for_news_media_text,
	abstract = {There is a rising need for automated analysis of news text, and topic models have proven to be useful tools for this task. However, as the quality of the topics induced by topic models greatly varies, much research effort has been devoted to their automated evaluation. Recent research has focused on topic coherence as a measure of a topic's quality. Existing topic coherence measures work by considering the semantic similarity of topic words. This makes them unfit to detect the coherence of transient topics with semantically unrelated topic words, which abound in news media texts. In this paper, we introduce the notion of document-based topic coherence and propose novel topic coherence measures that estimate topic coherence based on topic documents rather than topic words. We evaluate the proposed measures on two datasets containing topics manually labeled for document-based coherence, on which the proposed measures outperform a strong baseline as well as word-based coherence measures. We also demonstrate the usefulness of document-based coherence measures for automated topic discovery from news media texts.},

@article{aletras_2017_evaluating_topic_representations_for_exploring_document_collections,
	abstract = {Topic models have been shown to be a useful way of representing the content of large document collections, for example, via visualization interfaces topic browsers. These systems enable users to explore collections by way of latent topics. A standard way to represent a topic is using a term list; that is the top-n words with highest conditional probability within the topic. Other topic representations such as textual and image labels also have been proposed. However, there has been no comparison of these alternative representations. In this article, we compare 3 different topic representations in a document retrieval task. Participants were asked to retrieve relevant documents based on predefined queries within a fixed time limit, presenting topics in one of the following modalities: a lists of terms, b textual phrase labels, and c image labels. Results show that textual labels are easier for users to interpret than are term lists and image labels. Moreover, the precision of retrieved documents for textual and image labels is comparable to the precision achieved by representing topics using term lists, demonstrating that labeling methods are an effective alternative topic representation.},

	abstract = {In the 2017 German Federal elections, the "Alternative for Deutschland'', or AfD, party was able to take control of many seats in German parliament. Their success was credited, in part, to their large online presence. Like other "alt-right'' organizations worldwide, this party is tech savvy, generating a large social media footprint, especially on Twitter, which provides an ample opportunity to understand their online behavior. In this work we present an analysis of Twitter data related to the aforementioned election. We show how users self-organize into communities, and identify the themes that define those communities. Next we analyze the content generated by those communities, and the extent to which these communities interact. Despite these elections being held in Germany, we note a substantial impact from the English-speaking Twittersphere. Specifically, we note that many of these accounts appear to be from the American alt-right movement, and support the German alt-right movement.},

@article{morstatter_2017_in_search_of_coherence_and_consensus_measuring_the_interpretability_of_statistical_topics,
	abstract = {Topic modeling is an important tool in natural language processing. Topic models provide two forms of output. The first is a predictive model. This type of model has the ability to predict unseen documents (e.g., their categories). When topic models are used in this way, there are ample measures to assess their performance. The second output of these models is the topics themselves. Topics are lists of keywords that describe the top words pertaining to each topic. Often, these lists of keywords are presented to a human subject who then assesses the meaning of the topic, which is ultimately subjective. One of the fundamental problems of topic models lies in assessing the quality of the topics from the perspective of human interpretability. Naturally, human subjects need to be employed to evaluate interpretability of a topic. Lately, crowdsourcing approaches are widely used to serve the role of human subjects in evaluation. In this work we study measures of interpretability and propose to measure topic interpretability from two perspectives: topic coherence and topic consensus. We start with an existing measure for topic coherence--model precision. It evaluates coherence of a topic by introducing an intruded word and measuring how well a human subject or a crowdsourcing approach could identify the intruded word: if it is easy to identify, the topic is coherent. We then investigate how we can measure coherence comprehensively by examining dimensions of topic coherence. For the second perspective of topic interpretability, we suggest topic consensus that measures how well the results of a crowdsourcing approach matches those given categories of topics. Good topics should lead to good categories, thus, high topic consensus. Therefore, if there is low topic consensus in terms of categories, topics could be of low interpretability. We then further discuss how topic coherence and topic consensus assess different aspects of topic interpretability and hope that this work can pave way for comprehensive measures of topic interpretability.},

	abstract = {Topic modeling for short texts faces a tough challenge, owing to the sparsity problem. An effective solution is to aggregate short texts into long pseudo-documents before training a standard topic model. The main concern of this solution is the way of aggregating short texts. A recent developed self-aggregation-based topic model (SATM) can adaptively aggregate short texts without using heuristic information. However, the model definition of SATM is a bit rigid, and more importantly, it tends to overfitting and time-consuming for large-scale corpora. To improve SATM, we propose a generalized topic model for short texts, namely latent topic model (LTM). In LTM, we assume that the observable short texts are snippets of normal long texts (namely original documents) generated by a given standard topic model, but their original document memberships are unknown. With Gibbs sampling, LTM drives an adaptive aggregation process of short texts, and simultaneously estimates other latent variables of interest. Additionally, we propose a mini-batch scheme for fast inference. Experimental results indicate that LTM is competitive with the state-of-the-art baseline models on short text topic modeling.},

@article{agrawal_2018_what_is_wrong_with_topic_modeling_and_how_to_fix_it_using_search_based_software_engineering,
	abstract = {Context
Topic modeling finds human-readable structures in unstructured textual data. A widely used topic modeling technique is Latent Dirichlet allocation. When running on different datasets, LDA suffers from ``order effects'', i.e., different topics are generated if the order of training data is shuffled. Such order effects introduce a systematic error for any study. This error can relate to misleading results; specifically, inaccurate topic descriptions and a reduction in the efficacy of text mining classification results.
Objective
To provide a method in which distributions generated by LDA are more stable and can be used for further analysis.
Method
We use LDADE, a search-based software engineering tool which uses Differential Evolution (DE) to tune the LDA's parameters. LDADE is evaluated on data from a programmer information exchange site (Stackoverflow), title and abstract text of thousands of Software Engineering (SE) papers, and software defect reports from NASA. Results were collected across different implementations of LDA (Python+Scikit-Learn, Scala+Spark) across Linux platform and for different kinds of LDAs (VEM, Gibbs sampling). Results were scored via topic stability and text mining classification accuracy.
Results
In all treatments: (i) standard LDA exhibits very large topic instability; (ii) LDADE's tunings dramatically reduce cluster instability; (iii) LDADE also leads to improved performances for supervised as well as unsupervised learning.
Conclusion
Due to topic instability, using standard LDA with its ``off-the-shelf'' settings should now be depreciated. Also, in future, we should require SE papers that use LDA to test and (if needed) mitigate LDA topic instability. Finally, LDADE is a candidate technology for effectively and efficiently reducing that instability.},

	abstract = {Electronic health records (EHR) are rich heterogeneous collections of patient health information, whose broad adoption provides clinicians and researchers unprecedented opportunities for health informatics, disease-risk prediction, actionable clinical recommendations, and precision medicine. However, EHRs present several modeling challenges, including highly sparse data matrices, noisy irregular clinical notes, arbitrary biases in billing code assignment, diagnosis-driven lab tests, and heterogeneous data types. To address these challenges, we present MixEHR, a multi-view Bayesian topic model. We demonstrate MixEHR on MIMIC-III, Mayo Clinic Bipolar Disorder, and Quebec Congenital Heart Disease EHR datasets. Qualitatively, MixEHR disease topics reveal meaningful combinations of clinical features across heterogeneous data types. Quantitatively, we observe superior prediction accuracy of diagnostic codes and lab test imputations compared to the state-of-art methods. We leverage the inferred patient topic mixtures to classify target diseases and predict mortality of patients in critical conditions. In all comparison, MixEHR confers competitive performance and reveals meaningful disease-related topics.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Electronic health record (EHR) data provides a new venue to elucidate disease comorbidities and latent phenotypes for precision medicine. To fully exploit its potential, a realistic data generative process of the EHR data needs to be modelled.Materials and Methods: We present MixEHR-S to jointly infer specialist-disease topics from the EHR data. As the key contribution, we model the specialist assignments and ICD-coded diagnoses as the latent topics based on patient's underlying disease topic mixture in a novel unified supervised hierarchical Bayesian topic model. For efficient inference, we developed a closed-form collapsed variational inference algorithm to learn the model distributions of MixEHR-S.Results: We applied MixEHR-S to two independent large-scale EHR databases in Quebec with three targeted applications: (1) Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) diagnostic prediction among 154,775 patients; (2) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnostic prediction among 73,791 patients; (3) future insulin treatment prediction among 78,712 patients diagnosed with diabetes as a mean to assess the disease exacerbation. In all three applications, MixEHR-S conferred clinically meaningful latent topics among the most predictive latent topics and achieved superior target prediction accuracy compared to the existing methods, providing opportunities for prioritizing high-risk patients for healthcare services.Availability and implementation: MixEHR-S source code and scripts of the experiments are freely available at https://github.com/li-lab-mcgill/mixehrS},

@article{wang_2020_unsupervised_machine_learning_for_the_discovery_of_latent_disease_clusters_and_patient_subgroups_using_electronic_health_records,
	abstract = {Machine learning has become ubiquitous and a key technology on mining electronic health records (EHRs) for facilitating clinical research and practice. Unsupervised machine learning, as opposed to supervised learning, has shown promise in identifying novel patterns and relations from EHRs without using human created labels. In this paper, we investigate the application of unsupervised machine learning models in discovering latent disease clusters and patient subgroups based on EHRs. We utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model, and proposed a novel model named Poisson Dirichlet Model (PDM), which extends the LDA approach using a Poisson distribution to model patients' disease diagnoses and to alleviate age and sex factors by considering both observed and expected observations. In the empirical experiments, we evaluated LDA and PDM on three patient cohorts, namely Osteoporosis, Delirium/Dementia, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)/Bronchiectasis Cohorts, with their EHR data retrieved from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) medical records linkage system, for the discovery of latent disease clusters and patient subgroups. We compared the effectiveness of LDA and PDM in identifying disease clusters through the visualization of disease representations. We tested the performance of LDA and PDM in differentiating patient subgroups through survival analysis, as well as statistical analysis of demographics and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) scores in those subgroups. The experimental results show that the proposed PDM could effectively identify distinguished disease clusters based on the latent patterns hidden in the EHR data by alleviating the impact of age and sex, and that LDA could stratify patients into differentiable subgroups with larger p-values than PDM. However, those subgroups identified by LDA are highly associated with patients' age and sex. The subgroups discovered by PDM might imply the underlying patterns of diseases of greater interest in epidemiology research due to the alleviation of age and sex. Both unsupervised machine learning approaches could be leveraged to discover patient subgroups using EHRs but with different foci.},

@inproceedings{chang_2018_distributional_inclusion_vector_embedding_for_unsupervised_hypernymy_detection,
	abstract = {Modeling hypernymy, such as poodle is-a dog, is an important generalization aid to many NLP tasks, such as entailment, relation extraction, and question answering. Supervised learning from labeled hypernym sources, such as WordNet, limits the coverage of these models, which can be addressed by learning hypernyms from unlabeled text. Existing unsupervised methods either do not scale to large vocabularies or yield unacceptably poor accuracy. This paper introduces distributional inclusion vector embedding (DIVE), a simple-to-implement unsupervised method of hypernym discovery via per-word non-negative vector embeddings which preserve the inclusion property of word contexts. In experimental evaluations more comprehensive than any previous literature of which we are aware{---}evaluating on 11 datasets using multiple existing as well as newly proposed scoring functions{---}we find that our method provides up to double the precision of previous unsupervised methods, and the highest average performance, using a much more compact word representation, and yielding many new state-of-the-art results.},

	abstract = {We present a Few-Shot Relation Classification Dataset (dataset), consisting of 70, 000 sentences on 100 relations derived from Wikipedia and annotated by crowdworkers. The relation of each sentence is first recognized by distant supervision methods, and then filtered by crowdworkers. We adapt the most recent state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods for relation classification and conduct thorough evaluation of these methods. Empirical results show that even the most competitive few-shot learning models struggle on this task, especially as compared with humans. We also show that a range of different reasoning skills are needed to solve our task. These results indicate that few-shot relation classification remains an open problem and still requires further research. Our detailed analysis points multiple directions for future research.},

@inproceedings{breitfeller_2019_finding_microaggressions_in_the_wild_a_case_for_locating_elusive_phenomena_in_social_media_posts,
	abstract = {Microaggressions are subtle, often veiled, manifestations of human biases. These uncivil interactions can have a powerful negative impact on people by marginalizing minorities and disadvantaged groups. The linguistic subtlety of microaggressions in communication has made it difficult for researchers to analyze their exact nature, and to quantify and extract microaggressions automatically. Specifically, the lack of a corpus of real-world microaggressions and objective criteria for annotating them have prevented researchers from addressing these problems at scale. In this paper, we devise a general but nuanced, computationally operationalizable typology of microaggressions based on a small subset of data that we have. We then create two datasets: one with examples of diverse types of microaggressions recollected by their targets, and another with gender-based microaggressions in public conversations on social media. We introduce a new, more objective, criterion for annotation and an active-learning based procedure that increases the likelihood of surfacing posts containing microaggressions. Finally, we analyze the trends that emerge from these new datasets.},

Here we suggest that a subtle linguistic cue---the generic usage of the word ``you'' (i.e., ``you'' that refers to people in general rather than to one or more specific individuals) carries persuasive force, influencing how people discern unfamiliar norms. Across five experiments (N = 800), people endorsed unfamiliar behaviors described with generic-you (e.g., ``You share them with your friends'') as more normatively correct than behaviors expressed with `I' (e.g., ``I share them with my family'') or third-person singular pronouns (``he'' or ``she''; e.g., ``She shares them with her family''). These effects persisted even when participants were told that their informants were highly knowledgeable about the norms. Together, these findings indicate that generic-you functions as a linguistic nudge that carries persuasive force. Broadly, they add to a growing body of literature on how subtle linguistic shifts can meaningfully influence social cognition.},

While extensive research has focused on functional architectures for representing words and sentences, there is less work on representing arbitrary spans of text within sentences. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of six span representation methods using eight pretrained language representation models across six tasks, including two tasks that we introduce. We find that, although some simple span representations are fairly reliable across tasks, in general the optimal span representation varies by task, and can also vary within different facets of individual tasks. We also find that the choice of span representation has a bigger impact with a fixed pretrained encoder than with a fine-tuned encoder.},

Further, existing datasets were created using rating scales and thus suffer from limitations such as in consistent annotations and scale region bias. In this paper, we describe how we created a large, fine-grained, bigram relatedness dataset (BiRD), using a comparative annotation technique called Best{--}Worst Scaling. Each of BiRD{'}s 3,345 English term pairs involves at least one bigram. We show that the relatedness scores obtained are highly reliable (split-half reliability r= 0.937). We analyze the data to obtain insights into bigram semantic relatedness. Finally, we present benchmark experiments on using the relatedness dataset as a testbed to evaluate simple unsupervised measures of semantic composition. BiRD is made freely available to foster further research on how meaning can be represented and how meaning can be composed.},

@inproceedings{bommasani_2020_interpreting_pretrained_contextualized_representations_via_reductions_to_static_embeddings,
	abstract = {Contextualized representations (e.g. ELMo, BERT) have become the default pretrained representations for downstream NLP applications. In some settings, this transition has rendered their static embedding predecessors (e.g. Word2Vec, GloVe) obsolete. As a side-effect, we observe that older interpretability methods for static embeddings {---} while more diverse and mature than those available for their dynamic counterparts {---} are underutilized in studying newer contextualized representations. Consequently, we introduce simple and fully general methods for converting from contextualized representations to static lookup-table embeddings which we apply to 5 popular pretrained models and 9 sets of pretrained weights. Our analysis of the resulting static embeddings notably reveals that pooling over many contexts significantly improves representational quality under intrinsic evaluation. Complementary to analyzing representational quality, we consider social biases encoded in pretrained representations with respect to gender, race/ethnicity, and religion and find that bias is encoded disparately across pretrained models and internal layers even for models with the same training data. Concerningly, we find dramatic inconsistencies between social bias estimators for word embeddings.},

Previous studies either learn non-compositional phrase representations with general word embedding learning techniques or learn compositional phrase representations based on syntactic structures, which either require huge amounts of human annotations or cannot be easily generalized to all phrases. In this work, we propose to take advantage of large-scaled paraphrase database and present a pairwise-GRU framework to generate compositional phrase representations.

@article{wang_2019_atm_adversarial_neural_topic_model,
	abstract = {Topic models are widely used for thematic structure discovery in text. But traditional topic models often require dedicated inference procedures for specific tasks at hand. Also, they are not designed to generate word-level semantic representations. To address the limitations, we propose a neural topic modeling approach based on the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), called Adversarial-neural Topic Model (ATM) in this paper. To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt to use adversarial training for topic modeling. The proposed ATM models topics with dirichlet prior and employs a generator network to capture the semantic patterns among latent topics. Meanwhile, the generator could also produce word-level semantic representations. Besides, to illustrate the feasibility of porting ATM to tasks other than topic modeling, we apply ATM for open domain event extraction. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed ATM, two topic modeling benchmark corpora and an event dataset are employed in the experiments. Our experimental results on benchmark corpora show that ATM generates more coherence topics (considering five topic coherence measures), outperforming a number of competitive baselines. Moreover, the experiments on event dataset also validate that the proposed approach is able to extract meaningful events from news articles.},

@inproceedings{miao_2017_discovering_discrete_latent_topics_with_neural_variational_inference,
	abstract = {Topic models have been widely explored as probabilistic generative models of documents. Traditional inference methods have sought closed-form derivations for updating the models, however as the expressiveness of these models grows, so does the difficulty of performing fast and accurate inference over their parameters. This paper presents alternative neural approaches to topic modelling by providing parameterisable distributions over topics which permit training by backpropagation in the framework of neural variational inference. In addition, with the help of a stick-breaking construction, we propose a recurrent network that is able to discover a notionally unbounded number of topics, analogous to Bayesian non-parametric topic models. Experimental results on the MXM Song Lyrics, 20NewsGroups and Reuters News datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of these neural topic models.},

@inproceedings{zhou_2017_event_extraction_from_twitter_using_non_parametric_bayesian_mixture_model_with_word_embeddings,
	abstract = {To extract structured representations of newsworthy events from Twitter, unsupervised models typically assume that tweets involving the same named entities and expressed using similar words are likely to belong to the same event. Hence, they group tweets into clusters based on the co-occurrence patterns of named entities and topical keywords. However, there are two main limitations. First, they require the number of events to be known beforehand, which is not realistic in practical applications. Second, they don{'}t recognise that the same named entity might be referred to by multiple mentions and tweets using different mentions would be wrongly assigned to different events. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-parametric Bayesian mixture model with word embeddings for event extraction, in which the number of events can be inferred automatically and the issue of lexical variations for the same named entity can be dealt with properly. Our model has been evaluated on three datasets with sizes ranging between 2,499 and over 60 million tweets. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the baseline approach on all datasets by 5-8{\%} in F-measure.},

While specialized models have been developed for particular applications, few are widely used in practice, as customization typically requires derivation of a custom inference algorithm. In this paper, we build on recent advances in variational inference methods and propose a general neural framework, based on topic models, to enable flexible incorporation of metadata and allow for rapid exploration of alternative models. Our approach achieves strong performance, with a manageable tradeoff between perplexity, coherence, and sparsity. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our framework through an exploration of a corpus of articles about US immigration.},

@inproceedings{wang_2019_open_event_extraction_from_online_text_using_a_generative_adversarial_network,
	abstract = {To extract the structured representations of open-domain events, Bayesian graphical models have made some progress. However, these approaches typically assume that all words in a document are generated from a single event. While this may be true for short text such as tweets, such an assumption does not generally hold for long text such as news articles. Moreover, Bayesian graphical models often rely on Gibbs sampling for parameter inference which may take long time to converge. To address these limitations, we propose an event extraction model based on Generative Adversarial Nets, called Adversarial-neural Event Model (AEM). AEM models an event with a Dirichlet prior and uses a generator network to capture the patterns underlying latent events. A discriminator is used to distinguish documents reconstructed from the latent events and the original documents. A byproduct of the discriminator is that the features generated by the learned discriminator network allow the visualization of the extracted events. Our model has been evaluated on two Twitter datasets and a news article dataset. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the baseline approaches on all the datasets, with more significant improvements observed on the news article dataset where an increase of 15{\%} is observed in F-measure.},

@inproceedings{li_2020_global_surveillance_of_covid_19_by_mining_news_media_using_a_multi_source_dynamic_embedded_topic_model,
	abstract = {As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, understanding the global impact of non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) is important for formulating effective intervention strategies, particularly as many countries prepare for future waves. We used a machine learning approach to distill latent topics related to NPI from large-scale international news media. We hypothesize that these topics are informative about the timing and nature of implemented NPI, dependent on the source of the information (e.g., local news versus official government announcements) and the target countries. Given a set of latent topics associated with NPI (e.g., self-quarantine, social distancing, online education, etc), we assume that countries and media sources have different prior distributions over these topics, which are sampled to generate the news articles. To model the source-specific topic priors, we developed a semi-supervised, multi-source, dynamic, embedded topic model. Our model is able to simultaneously infer latent topics and learn a linear classifier to predict NPI labels using the topic mixtures as input for each news article. To learn these models, we developed an efficient end-to-end amortized variational inference algorithm. We applied our models to news data collected and labelled by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN). Through comprehensive experiments, we observed superior topic quality and intervention prediction accuracy, compared to the baseline embedded topic models, which ignore information on media source and intervention labels. The inferred latent topics reveal distinct policies and media framing in different countries and media sources, and also characterize reaction to COVID-19 and NPI in a semantically meaningful manner. Our PyTorch code is available on Github (htps://github.com/li-lab-mcgill/covid19_media).},

	abstract = {The clustering-based unsupervised relation discovery method has gradually become one of the important methods of open relation extraction (OpenRE). However, high-dimensional vectors can encode complex linguistic information which leads to the problem that the derived clusters cannot explicitly align with the relational semantic classes. In this work, we propose a relation-oriented clustering model and use it to identify the novel relations in the unlabeled data. Specifically, to enable the model to learn to cluster relational data, our method leverages the readily available labeled data of pre-defined relations to learn a relation-oriented representation. We minimize distance between the instance with same relation by gathering the instances towards their corresponding relation centroids to form a cluster structure, so that the learned representation is cluster-friendly. To reduce the clustering bias on predefined classes, we optimize the model by minimizing a joint objective on both labeled and unlabeled data. Experimental results show that our method reduces the error rate by 29.2{\%} and 15.7{\%}, on two datasets respectively, compared with current SOTA methods.},

In this paper, we propose a text generation model that learns semantics and structural features simultaneously. This model captures structural features by a sequential variational autoencoder component and leverages a topic modeling component based on Gaussian distribution to enhance the recognition of text semantics. To make the reconstructed text more coherent to the topics, the model further adapts the encoder of the topic modeling component for a discriminator. The results of experiments over several datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several states of the art models in terms of text perplexity and topic coherence. Moreover, the latent representations learned by our model is superior to others in a text classification task. Finally, given the input texts, our model can generate meaningful texts which hold similar structures but under different topics.},

@inproceedings{yang_2020_adversarial_learning_for_robust_deep_clustering,
	abstract = {Deep clustering integrates embedding and clustering together to obtain the optimal nonlinear embedding space, which is more effective in real-world scenarios compared with conventional clustering methods. However, the robustness of the clustering network is prone to being attenuated especially when it encounters an adversarial attack. A small perturbation in the embedding space will lead to diverse clustering results since the labels are absent. In this paper, we propose a robust deep clustering method based on adversarial learning. Specifically, we first attempt to define adversarial samples in the embedding space for the clustering network. Meanwhile, we devise an adversarial attack strategy to explore samples that easily fool the clustering layers but do not impact the performance of the deep embedding. We then provide a simple yet efficient defense algorithm to improve the robustness of the clustering network. Experimental results on two popular datasets show that the proposed adversarial learning method can significantly enhance the robustness and further improve the overall clustering performance. Particularly, the proposed method is generally applicable to multiple existing clustering frameworks to boost their robustness.},

Words predicted according to a context are numerous but appropriate for the augmentation of the original words. Furthermore, we retrofit a language model with a label-conditional architecture, which allows the model to augment sentences without breaking the label-compatibility. Through the experiments for six various different text classification tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed method improves classifiers based on the convolutional or recurrent neural networks.},

For the Poisson gamma belief network (PGBN), a recently proposed deep discrete LVM, we derive an alternative representation that is referred to as deep latent Dirichlet allocation (DLDA). Exploiting data augmentation and marginalization techniques, we derive a block-diagonal Fisher information matrix and its inverse for the simplex-constrained global model parameters of DLDA. Exploiting that Fisher information matrix with stochastic gradient MCMC, we present topic-layer-adaptive stochastic gradient Riemannian (TLASGR) MCMC that jointly learns simplex-constrained global parameters across all layers and topics, with topic and layer specific learning rates.

To this end, we rearrange and explore the semantics learned by a topic model, and then propose a topic assistant (TA) including three modules. TA is compatible with various Transformer-based models and user-friendly since i) TA is a plug-and-play model that does not break any structure of the original Transformer network, making users easily fine-tune Transformer+TA based on a well pre-trained model; ii) TA only introduces a small number of extra parameters. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that TA is able to improve the performance of several Transformer-based models.},

@inproceedings{guo_2017_improved_deep_embedded_clustering_with_local_structure_preservation,
	abstract = {Deep clustering learns deep feature representations that favor clustering task using neural networks. Some pioneering work proposes to simultaneously learn embedded features and perform clustering by explicitly defining a clustering oriented loss. Though promising performance has been demonstrated in various applications, we observe that a vital ingredient has been overlooked by these work that the defined clustering loss may corrupt feature space, which leads to non-representative meaningless features and this in turn hurts clustering performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Improved Deep Embedded Clustering (IDEC) algorithm to take care of data structure preservation. Specifically, we manipulate feature space to scatter data points using a clustering loss as guidance. To constrain the manipulation and maintain the local structure of data generating distribution, an under-complete autoencoder is applied. By integrating the clustering loss and autoencoder's reconstruction loss, IDEC can jointly optimize cluster labels assignment and learn features that are suitable for clustering with local structure preservation. The resultant optimization problem can be effectively solved by mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation. Experiments on image and text datasets empirically validate the importance of local structure preservation and the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

@inproceedings{wang_2020_neural_topic_model_with_attention_for_supervised_learning,
	abstract = {Topic modeling utilizing neural variational inference has shown promising results recently. Unlike traditional Bayesian topic models, neural topic models use deep neural network to approximate the intractable marginal distribution and thus gain strong generalisation ability. However, neural topic models are unsupervised model. Directly using the document-specific topic proportions in downstream prediction tasks could lead to sub-optimal performance. This paper presents Topic Attention Model (TAM), a supervised neural topic model that integrates an attention recurrent neural network (RNN) model. We design a novel way to utilize document-specific topic proportions and global topic vectors learned from neural topic model in the attention mechanism. We also develop backpropagation inference method that allows for joint model optimisation.  Experimental results on three public datasets show that TAM  not only significantly improves supervised learning tasks, including classification and regression, but also achieves lower perplexity for the document modeling.},

@inproceedings{wu_2018_tracing_fake_news_footprints_characterizing_social_media_messages_by_how_they_propagate,
	abstract = {When a message, such as a piece of news, spreads in social networks, how can we classify it into categories of interests, such as genuine or fake news? Classification of social media content is a fundamental task for social media mining, and most existing methods regard it as a text categorization problem and mainly focus on using content features, such as words and hashtags. However, for many emerging applications like fake news and rumor detection, it is very challenging, if not impossible, to identify useful features from content. For example, intentional spreaders of fake news may manipulate the content to make it look like real news. To address this problem, this paper concentrates on modeling the propagation of messages in a social network. Specifically, we propose a novel approach, TraceMiner, to (1) infer embeddings of social media users with social network structures; and (2) utilize an LSTM-RNN to represent and classify propagation pathways of a message. Since content information is sparse and noisy on social media, adopting TraceMiner allows to provide a high degree of classification accuracy even in the absence of content information. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the superiority over state-of-the-art approaches on the task of fake news detection and news categorization.},

	abstract = {Workers of microtask crowdsourcing marketplaces strive to find a balance between the need for monetary income and the need for high reputation. Such balance is often threatened by poorly formulated tasks, as workers attempt their execution despite a sub-optimal understanding of the work to be done.In this paper we highlight the role of clarity as a characterising property of tasks in crowdsourcing. We surveyed 100 workers of the CrowdFlower platform to verify the presence of issues with task clarity in crowdsourcing marketplaces, reveal how crowd workers deal with such issues, and motivate the need for mechanisms that can predict and measure task clarity. Next, we propose a novel model for task clarity based on the goal and role clarity constructs. We sampled 7.1K tasks from the Amazon mTurk marketplace, and acquired labels for task clarity from crowd workers. We show that task clarity is coherently perceived by crowd workers, and is affected by the type of the task. We then propose a set of features to capture task clarity, and use the acquired labels to train and validate a supervised machine learning model for task clarity prediction. Finally, we perform a long-term analysis of the evolution of task clarity on Amazon mTurk, and show that clarity is not a property suitable for temporal characterisation.},

	abstract = {Crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) are widely used by organizations, researchers, and individuals to outsource a broad range of tasks to crowd workers. Prior research has shown that crowdsourcing can pose privacy risks (e.g., de-anonymization) to crowd workers. However, little is known about the specific privacy issues crowd workers have experienced and how they perceive the state of privacy in crowdsourcing. In this paper, we present results from an online survey of 435 MTurk crowd workers from the US, India, and other countries and areas. Our respondents reported different types of privacy concerns (e.g., data aggregation, profiling, scams), experiences of privacy losses (e.g., phishing, malware, stalking, targeted ads), and privacy expectations on MTurk (e.g., screening tasks). Respondents from multiple countries and areas reported experiences with the same privacy issues, suggesting that these problems may be endemic to the whole MTurk platform. We discuss challenges, high-level principles and concrete suggestions in protecting crowd workers'; privacy on MTurk and in crowdsourcing more broadly.},

	abstract = {Tasks on crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk often request workers' personal information, raising privacy risks that may be exacerbated by requester-worker power dynamics. We interviewed 14 workers to understand how they navigate these risks. We found that Turkers' decisions to provide personal information during tasks were based on evaluations of the pay rate, the requester, the purpose, and the perceived sensitivity of the request. Participants also engaged in multiple privacy-protective behaviors, such as abandoning tasks or providing inaccurate data, though there were costs associated with these behaviors, such as wasted time and risk of rejection. Finally, their privacy concerns and practices evolved as they learned about both the platform and worker-designed tools and forums. These findings deepen our understanding of both privacy decision-making and invisible labor in paid crowdsourcing, and emphasize a general need to understand how privacy stances change over time.},

Because standard performance evaluation of topic interpretability uses automated measures modeled on human evaluation tests that are dissimilar to applied usage, these models{'} generalizability remains in question. In this paper, we probe the issue of validity in topic model evaluation and assess how informative coherence measures are for specialized collections used in an applied setting. Informed by the literature, we propose four understandings of interpretability. We evaluate these using a novel experimental framework reflective of varied applied settings, including human evaluations using open labeling, typical of applied research. These evaluations show that for some specialized collections, standard coherence measures may not inform the most appropriate topic model or the optimal number of topics, and current interpretability performance validation methods are challenged as a means to confirm model quality in the absence of ground truth data.},

However, existing topic models fail to learn interpretable topics when working with large and heavy-tailed vocabularies. To this end, we develop the embedded topic model (etm), a generative model of documents that marries traditional topic models with word embeddings. More specifically, the etm models each word with a categorical distribution whose natural parameter is the inner product between the word{'}s embedding and an embedding of its assigned topic. To fit the etm, we develop an efficient amortized variational inference algorithm. The etm discovers interpretable topics even with large vocabularies that include rare words and stop words. It outperforms existing document models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, in terms of both topic quality and predictive performance.},

We conduct our research in two steps. First, we propose improvements to the recently proposed neural entity grid model by lexicalizing its entity transitions. Then, we extend the model to asynchronous conversations by incorporating the underlying conversational structure in the entity grid representation and feature computation. Our model achieves state of the art results on standard coherence assessment tasks in monologue and conversations outperforming existing models.

While these techniques work well for sentences, they can not easily be applied to short text because of its shortness and sparsity. In this paper, we propose a framework based on convolutional neural networks that combines explicit and implicit representations of short text for classification. We first conceptualize a short text as a set of relevant concepts using a large taxonomy knowledge base. We then obtain the embedding of short text by coalescing the words and relevant concepts on top of pre-trained word vectors. We further incorporate character level features into our model to capture fine-grained subword information. Experimental results on five commonly used datasets show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

On annotated data, we show that incorporating context and dialog acts leads to relative gains in topic classification accuracy by 35% and on unsupervised keyword detection recall by 11% for conversational interactions where topics frequently span multiple utterances. We show that topical metrics such as topical depth is highly correlated with dialog evaluation metrics such as coherence and engagement implying that conversational topic models can predict user satisfaction.

However, much work remains in the area of social conversation as well as free-form conversation over a broad range of domains and topics. To advance the state of the art in conversational AI, Amazon launched the Alexa Prize, a 2.5-million-dollar university competition where sixteen selected university teams were challenged to build conversational agents, known as socialbots, to converse coherently and engagingly with humans on popular topics such as Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Fashion and Technology for 20 minutes. The Alexa Prize offers the academic community a unique opportunity to perform research with a live system used by millions of users. The competition provided university teams with real user conversational data at scale, along with the user-provided ratings and feedback augmented with annotations by the Alexa team. This enabled teams to effectively iterate and make improvements throughout the competition while being evaluated in real-time through live user interactions. To build their socialbots, university teams combined state-of-the-art techniques with novel strategies in the areas of Natural Language Understanding, Context Modeling, Dialog Management, Response Generation, and Knowledge Acquisition. To support the efforts of participating teams, the Alexa Prize team made significant scientific and engineering investments to build and improve Conversational Speech Recognition, Topic Tracking, Dialog Evaluation, Voice User Experience, and tools for traffic management and scalability. This paper outlines the advances created by the university teams as well as the Alexa Prize team to achieve the common goal of solving the problem of Conversational AI.},

	abstract = {We present Edina, the University of Edinburgh's social bot for the Amazon Alexa Prize competition. Edina is a conversational agent whose responses utilize data harvested from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) through an innovative new technique we call self-dialogues. These are conversations in which a single AMT Worker plays both participants in a dialogue. Such dialogues are surprisingly natural, efficient to collect and reflective of relevant and/or trending topics. These self-dialogues provide training data for a generative neural network as well as a basis for soft rules used by a matching score component. Each match of a soft rule against a user utterance is associated with a confidence score which we show is strongly indicative of reply quality, allowing this component to self-censor and be effectively integrated with other components. Edina's full architecture features a rule-based system backing off to a matching score, backing off to a generative neural network. Our hybrid data-driven methodology thus addresses both coverage limitations of a strictly rule-based approach and the lack of guarantees of a strictly machine-learning approach.},

Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character $n$-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character $n$-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.},

To detect conversation topics per utterance, we adopt Deep Average Networks (DAN) and train a topic classifier on a variety of question and query data categorized into multiple topics. We propose a novel extension to DAN by adding a topic-word attention table that allows the system to jointly capture topic keywords in an utterance and perform topic classification. We compare our proposed topic based metrics with the ratings provided by users and show that our metrics both correlate with and complement human judgment.

Comparisons are made with baselines that use word level transfer learning via pretrained word embeddings as well as baselines do not use any transfer learning.

To quantify partisan audience bias, we developed a domain-level score by leveraging the sharing propensities of registered voters on a large Twitter panel.

Instead, we found that results positioned toward the bottom of Google SERPs were more left-leaning than results positioned toward the top, and that the direction and magnitude of overall lean varied by search query, component type (e.g. "answer boxes"), and other factors. Utilizing rank-weighted metrics that we adapted from prior work, we also found that Google's rankings shifted the average lean of SERPs to the right of their unweighted average.},

	abstract = {As algorithmic (and particularly machine learning) decision making systems become both more widespread and make more important decisions, there are growing concerns about their embedded values and ability to establish legitimacy among decision subjects. We argue that designing for contestability in these systems can assist in surfacing values, aligning system design and use with context, and building legitimacy. However, designing for contestability can be challenging, particularly in systems that are designed to be opaque: systems need to accurately surface embedded values, expose decision making processes in ways that are meaningful for users, support engagement with and allow influence over system performance, and so on. In addition to these technical aspects, designing for contestability may by challenged by the need to protect intellectual property and prevent gaming of the system. In this workshop, we will address goals, audiences, and designs for contestability in algorithmic systems. We hope to develop a taxonomy of contestable systems and understand the value provided by contestability, while bringing together a community to work on this multidisciplinary problem.},

	abstract = {Social computing researchers are beginning to apply machine learning tools to classify and analyze social media data. Our interest in understanding politeness in an online community focused our attention on tools that would help automate politeness analysis. This paper highlights one popular classification tool designed to score the politeness of text. Our application of this tool to Wikipedia data yielded some unexpected results. Those unexpected results led us to question how the tool worked and its effectiveness relative to human judgment and classification. We designed a user study to revalidate the tool with crowdworkers labeling samples of content from Wikipedia talk pages, imitating the original efforts to validate the tool. This revalidation points to challenges for automatic labeling. Based on our results, this paper reconsiders politeness in online communities as well as broader trends in the use of machine classifiers in social computing research.},

@article{scheuerman_2019_how_computers_see_gender_an_evaluation_of_gender_classification_in_commercial_facial_analysis_services,
	abstract = {Investigations of facial analysis (FA) technologies-such as facial detection and facial recognition-have been central to discussions about Artificial Intelligence's (AI) impact on human beings. Research on automatic gender recognition, the classification of gender by FA technologies, has raised potential concerns around issues of racial and gender bias. In this study, we augment past work with empirical data by conducting a systematic analysis of how gender classification and gender labeling in computer vision services operate when faced with gender diversity. We sought to understand how gender is concretely conceptualized and encoded into commercial facial analysis and image labeling technologies available today. We then conducted a two-phase study: (1) a system analysis of ten commercial FA and image labeling services and (2) an evaluation of five services using a custom dataset of diverse genders using self-labeled Instagram images. Our analysis highlights how gender is codified into both classifiers and data standards. We found that FA services performed consistently worse on transgender individuals and were universally unable to classify non-binary genders. In contrast, image labeling often presented multiple gendered concepts. We also found that user perceptions about gender performance and identity contradict the way gender performance is encoded into the computer vision infrastructure. We discuss our findings from three perspectives of gender identity (self-identity, gender performativity, and demographic identity) and how these perspectives interact across three layers: the classification infrastructure, the third-party applications that make use of that infrastructure, and the individuals who interact with that software. We employ Bowker and Star's concepts of "torque" and "residuality" to further discuss the social implications of gender classification. We conclude by outlining opportunities for creating more inclusive classification infrastructures and datasets, as well as with implications for policy.},

@article{fiebrink_2018_introduction_to_the_special_issue_on_human_centered_machine_learning,
	abstract = {Machine learning is one of the most important and successful techniques in contemporary computer science. Although it can be applied to myriad problems of human interest, research in machine learning is often framed in an impersonal way, as merely algorithms being applied to model data. However, this viewpoint hides considerable human work of tuning the algorithms, gathering the data, deciding what should be modeled in the first place, and using the outcomes of machine learning in the real world. Examining machine learning from a human-centered perspective includes explicitly recognizing human work, as well as reframing machine learning workflows based on situated human working practices, and exploring the co-adaptation of humans and intelligent systems. A human-centered understanding of machine learning in human contexts can lead not only to more usable machine learning tools, but to new ways of understanding what machine learning is good for and how to make it more useful. This special issue brings together nine articles that present different ways to frame machine learning in a human context. They represent very different application areas (from medicine to audio) and methodologies (including machine learning methods, human-computer interaction methods, and hybrids), but they all explore the human contexts in which machine learning is used. This introduction summarizes the articles in this issue and draws out some common themes.},

We interviewed 13 designers who had many years of experience designing the UX of ML-enhanced products and services. We probed them to characterize their practices. They shared they do not view themselves as ML experts, nor do they think learning more about ML would make them better designers. Instead, our participants appeared to be the most successful when they engaged in ongoing collaboration with data scientists to help envision what to make and when they embraced a data-centric culture. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of UX education and as opportunities for additional design research in support of UX designers working with ML.},

We present a neural language model that incorporates document context in the form of a topic model-like architecture, thus providing a succinct representation of the broader document context outside of the current sentence. Experiments over a range of datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms a pure sentence-based model in terms of language model perplexity, and leads to topics that are potentially more coherent than those produced by a standard LDA topic model. Our model also has the ability to generate related sentences for a topic, providing another way to interpret topics.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is now a fairly established technology, and user experience (UX) designers appear regularly to integrate ML services in new apps, devices, and systems. Interestingly, this technology has not experienced a wealth of design innovation that other technologies have, and this might be because it is a new and difficult design material. To better understand why we have witnessed little design innovation, we conducted a survey of current UX practitioners with regards to how new ML services are envisioned and developed in UX practice. Our survey probed on how ML may or may not have been a part of their UX design education, on how they work to create new things with developers, and on the challenges they have faced working with this material. We use the findings from this survey and our review of related literature to present a series of challenges for UX and interaction design research and education. Finally, we discuss areas where new research and new curriculum might help our community unlock the power of design thinking to re-imagine what ML might be and might do.},

@article{zhou_2016_nonparametric_bayesian_negative_binomial_factor_analysis,
	abstract = {A common approach to analyze a covariate-sample count matrix, an element of which represents how many times a covariate appears in a sample, is to factorize it under the Poisson likelihood. We show its limitation in capturing the tendency for a covariate present in a sample to both repeat itself and excite related ones. To address this limitation, we construct negative binomial factor analysis (NBFA) to factorize the matrix under the negative binomial likelihood, and relate it to a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution based mixed-membership model. To support countably infinite factors, we propose the hierarchical gamma-negative binomial process. By exploiting newly proved connections between discrete distributions, we construct two blocked and a collapsed Gibbs sampler that all adaptively truncate their number of factors, and demonstrate that the blocked Gibbs sampler developed under a compound Poisson representation converges fast and has low computational complexity. Example results show that NBFA has a distinct mechanism in adjusting its number of inferred factors according to the sample lengths, and provides clear advantages in parsimonious representation, predictive power, and computational complexity over previously proposed discrete latent variable models, which either completely ignore burstiness, or model only the burstiness of the covariates but not that of the factors.},

@article{srivastava_2017_autoencoding_variational_inference_for_topic_models,
	abstract = {Topic models are one of the most popular methods for learning representations of text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires mathematically deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to address this problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has proven diffi- cult to apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to our knowledge the first effective AEVB based inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Model (AVITM). This model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet prior and by component collapsing. We find that AVITM matches traditional methods in accuracy with much better inference time. Indeed, because of the inference network, we find that it is unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black box, it is readily applied to new topic models. As a dramatic illustration of this, we present a new topic model called ProdLDA, that replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By changing only one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA yields much more interpretable topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs sampling.},

@inproceedings{naesseth_2017_reparameterization_gradients_through_acceptance_rejection_sampling_algorithms,
	abstract = {Variational inference using the reparameterization trick has enabled large-scale approximate Bayesian inference in complex probabilistic models, leveraging stochastic optimization to sidestep intractable expectations. The reparameterization trick is applicable when we can simulate a random variable by applying a differentiable deterministic function on an auxiliary random variable whose distribution is fixed. For many distributions of interest (such as the gamma or Dirichlet), simulation of random variables relies on acceptance-rejection sampling. The discontinuity introduced by the accept-reject step means that standard reparameterization tricks are not applicable. We propose a new method that lets us leverage reparameterization gradients even when variables are outputs of a acceptance-rejection sampling algorithm. Our approach enables reparameterization on a larger class of variational distributions. In several studies of real and synthetic data, we show that the variance of the estimator of the gradient is significantly lower than other state-of-the-art methods. This leads to faster convergence of stochastic gradient variational inference.},

@article{zhao_2019_variational_autoencoders_for_sparse_and_overdispersed_discrete_data,
	abstract = {Many applications, such as text modelling, high-throughput sequencing, and recommender systems, require analysing sparse, high-dimensional, and overdispersed discrete (count-valued or binary) data. Although probabilistic matrix factorisation and linear/nonlinear latent factor models have enjoyed great success in modelling such data, many existing models may have inferior modelling performance due to the insufficient capability of modelling overdispersion in count-valued data and model misspecification in general. In this paper, we comprehensively study these issues and propose a variational autoencoder based framework that generates discrete data via negative-binomial distribution. We also examine the model's ability to capture properties, such as self- and cross-excitations in discrete data, which is critical for modelling overdispersion. We conduct extensive experiments on three important problems from discrete data analysis: text analysis, collaborative filtering, and multi-label learning. Compared with several state-of-the-art baselines, the proposed models achieve significantly better performance on the above problems.},

Geo-tagged social media data are useful resource for this task; however, the abundance of everyday language in them makes this task still challenging. To address such challenges, we present TopicOnTiles, a visual analytics system that can reveal information relevant to anomalous events in a multi-level tile-based map interface by using social media data. To this end, we adopt and improve a recently proposed topic modeling method that can extract spatio-temporally exclusive topics corresponding to a particular region and a time point. Furthermore, we utilize a tile-based map interface to efficiently handle large-scale data in parallel. Our user interface effectively highlights anomalous tiles using our novel glyph visualization that encodes the degree of anomaly computed by our exclusive topic modeling processes. To show the effectiveness of our system, we present several usage scenarios using real-world datasets as well as comprehensive user study results.},

	abstract = {Dirichlet Multinomial Regression (DMR) and other supervised topic models can incorporate arbitrary document-level features to inform topic priors. However, their ability to model corpora are limited by the representation and selection of these features {--} a choice the topic modeler must make. Instead, we seek models that can learn the feature representations upon which to condition topic selection. We present deep Dirichlet Multinomial Regression (dDMR), a generative topic model that simultaneously learns document feature representations and topics. We evaluate dDMR on three datasets: New York Times articles with fine-grained tags, Amazon product reviews with product images, and Reddit posts with subreddit identity. dDMR learns representations that outperform DMR and LDA according to heldout perplexity and are more effective at downstream predictive tasks as the number of topics grows. Additionally, human subjects judge dDMR topics as being more representative of associated document features. Finally, we find that supervision leads to faster convergence as compared to an LDA baseline and that dDMR{'}s model fit is less sensitive to training parameters than DMR.},

@inproceedings{pergola_2021_a_disentangled_adversarial_neural_topic_model_for_separating_opinions_from_plots_in_user_reviews,
	abstract = {The flexibility of the inference process in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) has recently led to revising traditional probabilistic topic models giving rise to Neural Topic Models (NTM). Although these approaches have achieved significant results, surprisingly very little work has been done on how to disentangle the latent topics. Existing topic models when applied to reviews may extract topics associated with writers{'} subjective opinions mixed with those related to factual descriptions such as plot summaries in movie and book reviews. It is thus desirable to automatically separate opinion topics from plot/neutral ones enabling a better interpretability. In this paper, we propose a neural topic model combined with adversarial training to disentangle opinion topics from plot and neutral ones. We conduct an extensive experimental assessment introducing a new collection of movie and book reviews paired with their plots, namely MOBO dataset, showing an improved coherence and variety of topics, a consistent disentanglement rate, and sentiment classification performance superior to other supervised topic models.},

BTM is built on the Poisson factorisation model with the incorporation of adversarial learning. It has been evaluated on a dataset constructed from Amazon reviews.

@inproceedings{alokaili_2020_automatic_generation_of_topic_labels,
	abstract = {Topic modelling is a popular unsupervised method for identifying the underlying themes in document collections that has many applications in information retrieval. A topic is usually represented by a list of terms ranked by their probability but, since these can be difficult to interpret, various approaches have been developed to assign descriptive labels to topics. Previous work on the automatic assignment of labels to topics has relied on a two-stage approach: (1) candidate labels are retrieved from a large pool (e.g. Wikipedia article titles); and then (2) re-ranked based on their semantic similarity to the topic terms. However, these extractive approaches can only assign candidate labels from a restricted set that may not include any suitable ones. This paper proposes using a sequence-to-sequence neural-based approach to generate labels that does not suffer from this limitation. The model is trained over a new large synthetic dataset created using distant supervision. The method is evaluated by comparing the labels it generates to ones rated by humans.},

	abstract = {Electronic health records (EHRs) provide rich clinical information and the opportunities to extract epidemiological patterns to understand and predict patient disease risks with suitable machine learning methods such as topic models. However, existing topic models do not generate identifiable topics each predicting a unique phenotype. One promising direction is to use known phenotype concepts to guide topic inference. We present a seed-guided Bayesian topic model called MixEHR-Seed with 3 contributions: (1) for each phenotype, we infer a dual-form of topic distribution: a seed-topic distribution over a small set of key EHR codes and a regular topic distribution over the entire EHR vocabulary; (2) we model age-dependent disease progression as Markovian dynamic topic priors; (3) we infer seed-guided multi-modal topics over distinct EHR data types. For inference, we developed a variational inference algorithm. Using MixEHR-Seed, we inferred 1569 PheCode-guided phenotype topics from an EHR database in Quebec, Canada covering 1.3 million patients for up to 20-year follow-up with 122 million records for 8539 and 1126 unique diagnostic and drug codes, respectively. We observed (1) accurate phenotype prediction by the guided topics, (2) clinically relevant PheCode-guided disease topics, (3) meaningful age-dependent disease prevalence.

@inproceedings{ahmadvand_2019_concet_entity_aware_topic_classification_for_open_domain_conversational_agents,
	abstract = {Identifying the topic (domain) of each user's utterance in open-domain conversational systems is a crucial step for all subsequent language understanding and response tasks. In particular, for complex domains, an utterance is often routed to a single component responsible for that domain. Thus, correctly mapping a user utterance to the right domain is critical. This is a challenging task: users could mention entities like actors, singers or locations to implicitly indicate the domain, which requires extensive domain knowledge to interpret. To address this problem, we introduce ConCET: a Concurrent Entity-aware conversational Topic classifier, which incorporates entity type information together with the utterance content features. Specifically, ConCET utilizes entity information to enrich the utterance representation, combining character, word, and entity type embeddings into a single representation. However, for rich domains with millions of available entities, unrealistic amounts of labeled training data would be required. To complement our model, we propose a simple and effective method for generating synthetic training data, to augment the typically limited amounts of labeled training data, using commonly available knowledge bases as to generate additional labeled utterances. We extensively evaluate ConCET and our proposed training method first on an openly available human-human conversational dataset called Self-Dialogue, to calibrate our approach against previous state-of-the-art methods; second, we evaluate ConCET on a large dataset of human-machine conversations with real users, collected as part of the Amazon Alexa Prize. Our results show that ConCET significantly improves topic classification performance on both datasets, reaching 8-10% improvements compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods. We complement our quantitative results with detailed analysis of system performance, which could be used for further improvements of conversational agents.},

	abstract = {Taxonomy is not only a fundamental form of knowledge representation, but also crucial to vast knowledge-rich applications, such as question answering and web search. Most existing taxonomy construction methods extract hypernym-hyponym entity pairs to organize a "universal" taxonomy. However, these generic taxonomies cannot satisfy user's specific interest in certain areas and relations. Moreover, the nature of instance taxonomy treats each node as a single word, which has low semantic coverage for people to fully understand. In this paper, we propose a method for seed-guided topical taxonomy construction, which takes a corpus and a seed taxonomy described by concept names as input, and constructs a more complete taxonomy based on user's interest, wherein each node is represented by a cluster of coherent terms. Our framework, CoRel, has two modules to fulfill this goal. A relation transferring module learns and transfers the user's interested relation along multiple paths to expand the seed taxonomy structure in width and depth. A concept learning module enriches the semantics of each concept node by jointly embedding the taxonomy and text. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets show that CoRel generates high-quality topical taxonomies and outperforms all the baselines significantly.},

To account for potential hierarchical topic structures, hierarchical topic models generalize flat topic models by incorporating latent topic hierarchies into their generative modeling process. However, due to their purely unsupervised nature, the learned topic hierarchy often deviates from users' particular needs or interests. To guide the hierarchical topic discovery process with minimal user supervision, we propose a new task, Hierarchical Topic Mining, which takes a category tree described by category names only, and aims to mine a set of representative terms for each category from a text corpus to help a user comprehend his/her interested topics. We develop a novel joint tree and text embedding method along with a principled optimization procedure that allows simultaneous modeling of the category tree structure and the corpus generative process in the spherical space for effective category-representative term discovery. Our comprehensive experiments show that our model, named JoSH, mines a high-quality set of hierarchical topics with high efficiency and benefits weakly-supervised hierarchical text classification tasks.},

In these works, latent representation learning and text clustering are performed simultaneously. Although these methods are becoming increasingly popular, they use pure cluster-oriented objectives, which can produce meaningless representations. To alleviate this problem, several improvements have been developed to introduce additional learning objectives in the clustering process, such as models based on contrastive learning. However, existing efforts rely heavily on learning meaningful representations at the instance level. They have limited focus on learning global representations, which are necessary to capture the overall data structure at the cluster level. In this paper, we propose a novel DEC model, which we named the deep embedded clustering model with cluster-level representation learning (DECCRL) to jointly learn cluster and instance level representations. Here, we extend the embedded topic modelling approach to introduce reconstruction constraints to help learn cluster-level representations. Experimental results on real-world short text datasets demonstrate that our model produces meaningful clusters.},

To learn about the major problems, we provide a short but comprehensive survey based on two complementary studies: (1) a literature review where we collect and organize problems known from interviews with workers, and (2) an empirical data analysis where we use topic modeling to mine workers{'} complaints from a new English corpus of workers{'} forum discussions. While literature covers all process phases, problems in the task evaluation are prevalent, including unfair rejections, late payments, and unjustified blockings of workers. According to the data, however, poor task design in terms of malfunctioning environments, bad workload estimation, and privacy violations seems to bother the workers most. Our findings form the basis for future research on how to improve crowdsourcing processes.},

	abstract = {Word composition is a promising technique for representation learning of large linguistic units (e.g., phrases, sentences and documents). However, most of the current composition models do not take the ambiguity of words and the context outside of a linguistic unit into consideration for learning representations, and consequently suffer from the inaccurate representation of semantics. To address this issue, we propose a model-free context-aware word composition model, which employs the latent semantic information as global context for learning representations. The proposed model attempts to resolve the word sense disambiguation and word composition in a unified framework. Extensive evaluation shows consistent improvements over various strong word representation/composition models at different granularities (including word, phrase and sentence), demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

Neural variational inference algorithms are developed to infer model parameters by using the reparameterization of Gamma distribution and the Gaussian approximation of Poisson distribution. Experiments on real-world datasets indicate that our models outperform state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of perplexity and topic coherence. The results also validate that both NB-NTM and GNB-NTM can produce explainable intermediate variables by generating dispersed proportions of document topics.},

The recently proposed Adversarial-neural Topic Model models topics with an adversarially trained generator network and employs Dirichlet prior to capture the semantic patterns in latent topics. It is effective in discovering coherent topics but unable to infer topic distributions for given documents or utilize available document labels. To overcome such limitations, we propose Topic Modeling with Cycle-consistent Adversarial Training (ToMCAT) and its supervised version sToMCAT. ToMCAT employs a generator network to interpret topics and an encoder network to infer document topics. Adversarial training and cycle-consistent constraints are used to encourage the generator and the encoder to produce realistic samples that coordinate with each other. sToMCAT extends ToMCAT by incorporating document labels into the topic modeling process to help discover more coherent topics. The effectiveness of the proposed models is evaluated on unsupervised/supervised topic modeling and text classification. The experimental results show that our models can produce both coherent and informative topics, outperforming a number of competitive baselines.},

	abstract = {Two general approaches are common for evaluating automatically generated labels in topic modeling: direct human assessment; or performance metrics that can be calculated without, but still correlate with, human assessment. However, both approaches implicitly assume that the quality of a topic label is single-dimensional. In contrast, this paper provides evidence that human assessments about the quality of topic labels consist of multiple latent dimensions. This evidence comes from human assessments of four simple labeling techniques. For each label, study participants responded to several items asking them to assess each label according to a variety of different criteria. Exploratory factor analysis shows that these human assessments of labeling quality have a two-factor latent structure. Subsequent analysis demonstrates that this multi-item, two-factor assessment can reveal nuances that would be missed using either a single-item human assessment of perceived label quality or established performance metrics. The paper concludes by suggesting future directions for the development of human-centered approaches to evaluating NLP and ML systems more broadly.},

In this paper, we propose a contrastive fine-tuning objective that enables BERT to produce more powerful phrase embeddings. Our approach (Phrase-BERT) relies on a dataset of diverse phrasal paraphrases, which is automatically generated using a paraphrase generation model, as well as a large-scale dataset of phrases in context mined from the Books3 corpus. Phrase-BERT outperforms baselines across a variety of phrase-level similarity tasks, while also demonstrating increased lexical diversity between nearest neighbors in the vector space. Finally, as a case study, we show that Phrase-BERT embeddings can be easily integrated with a simple autoencoder to build a phrase-based neural topic model that interprets topics as mixtures of words and phrases by performing a nearest neighbor search in the embedding space. Crowdsourced evaluations demonstrate that this phrase-based topic model produces more coherent and meaningful topics than baseline word and phrase-level topic models, further validating the utility of Phrase-BERT.},

By looking at topic discovery through matrix factorization lenses we show that spatial aggregation allows low rank approximation of the original document-word matrix, in which spatially distinct topics are preserved and non-spatial topics are aggregated into a single topic. Our experiments on synthetic data confirm this observation. Our experiments on 4.7 million tweets collected during the Sandy Hurricane in 2012 show that spatial and temporal aggregation allows rapid discovery of relevant spatial and temporal topics during that period. Our work indicates that different forms of document aggregation might be effective in rapid discovery of various types of distinct topics from large collections of documents.},

Existing pattern-based methods extract hypernym-hyponym term pairs and then organize these pairs into a taxonomy. However, by considering each term as an independent concept node, they overlook the topical proximity and the semantic correlations among terms. In this paper, we propose a method for constructing topic taxonomies, wherein every node represents a conceptual topic and is defined as a cluster of semantically coherent concept terms. Our method, TaxoGen, uses term embeddings and hierarchical clustering to construct a topic taxonomy in a recursive fashion. To ensure the quality of the recursive process, it consists of: (1) an adaptive spherical clustering module for allocating terms to proper levels when splitting a coarse topic into fine-grained ones; (2) a local embedding module for learning term embeddings that maintain strong discriminative power at different levels of the taxonomy. Our experiments on two real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TaxoGen compared with baseline methods.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to identify the customers' primary topics of concern regarding online retail brands that are shared among Twitter users. This study collects tweets associated with five leading UK online retailers covering the period from Black Friday to Christmas and New Year's sales. We use a combination of text analytical approaches including topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and network analysis to analyse the tweets. Through the analysis, we identify that delivery, product and customer service are among the most-discussed topics on Twitter. We also highlight the areas that receive the most negative customer sentiments such as delivery and customer service. Interestingly, we also identify emerging topics such as online engagement and in-store experience that are not captured by the existing literature on online retailing. Through a network analysis, we underscore the relationships among those important topics. This study derives insights on how well the leading online retail brands are performing and how their products and services are perceived by their customers. These insights can help businesses understand customers better and enable them to convert the information into meaningful knowledge to improve their business performance. The study offers a novel approach of transforming social media data into useful knowledge about online retailing. The incorporation of three analytical approaches offers insights for researchers to understand the hidden content behind the large collections of unstructured bodies of text, and this information can be used to improve online retailing services and reach out to customers.},

Most of the existing methods consider trust in a person as a value which does not vary across different scenarios without any attention to the distinction of domains or communities where trust is derived. However, the notion of context is a significant and indispensable factor for trust evaluation in practice. Due to the lack of the consideration of context, traditional methods cannot resolve the issue that arises when a highly trustworthy person in one domain is likely to dominate the results of trust assessment in others where the person is in fact less authoritative. To solve this problem, in this paper, we develop a general approach to accomplish topic-sensitive trust evaluation by considering the context of trust. We first propose a general framework which presents the well-organized architecture of topic-sensitive trust evaluation in online communities. Then, a user-topic model is proposed to automatically extract topic data from user-generated content based on the Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LLDA) model. To compare the topic differences between users, we design a topic coverage function for revealing their trust relationships in diverse topics. Moreover, we employ two traditional methods and extend them to accomplish trust prediction for people with multiple domain knowledge. Experiments based on a real-world dataset show that extended topic-sensitive approaches are more adaptive and accurate than those topic-free trust evaluation approaches, especially when the trust application scenario features multiple topics.},

@article{zhou_2022_a_weakly_supervised_graph_based_joint_sentiment_topic_model_for_multi_topic_sentiment_analysis,
	abstract = {Multi-topic sentiment analysis, which aims to identify the topics and classify their corresponding sentiment, is of great value in understanding consumers' behaviour and improving services. Because of the high cost of manual annotation of the datasets, topic model-based approaches that model the joint distributions of both topics and sentiments have been studied previously. Some studies proposed models that leverage the prior knowledge derived from the pre-trained word embeddings and have proven effective. However, most of the existing models are based on the assumption that words and topics are conditionally independent, ignoring the dependency relations among them. Additionally, the fine-tuning of the pre-trained word embeddings to incorporate the contextual information is also neglected in these models. This could result in the ambiguous representations of topics. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised graph-based joint sentiment topic model (W-GJST) that integrates an edge-gated graph convolutional network (E-GCN) into a joint sentiment-topic model. An importance sampling-based training method is proposed to learn the contextual representations of topics and words efficiently. Additionally, a self-training multi-topic classifier is designed for the multi-label topic identification. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed W-GJST compared to the baseline models in terms of topic modelling, topic identification and topic-sentiment identification.},

	abstract = {Research and development activities are regarded as one of the most influencing factors of the future of a country. Large investments in research can yield a tremendous outcome in terms of a country's overall wealth and strength. However, public financial resources of countries are often limited which calls for a wise and targeted investment. Scientific publications are considered as one of the main outputs of research investment. Although the general trend of scientific publications is increasing, a detailed analysis is required to monitor the research trends and assess whether they are in line with the top research priorities of the country. Such focused monitoring can shed light on scientific activities evolution as well as the formation of new research areas, thus helping governments to adjust priorities, if required. But monitoring the output of the funded research manually is not only very expensive and difficult, it is also subjective. Using structural topic models, in this paper we evaluated the trends in academic research performed by federally funded Canadian researchers during the time-frame of 2000--2018, covering more than 140,000 research publications. The proposed approach makes it possible to objectively and systematically monitor research projects, or any other set of documents related to research activities such as funding proposals, at large-scale. Our results confirm the accordance between the performed federally funded research projects and the top research priorities of Canada.},

@article{yang_2021_author_topic_model_for_co_occurring_normal_documents_and_short_texts_to_explore_individual_user_preferences,
	abstract = {The investigation of user preferences through user comments has attracted significant attention. Although topic models have been verified as useful tools to facilitate the understanding of textual contents, they cannot be directly applied to accomplish this task because of two problems. The first problem is the severe data sparsity suffered by user comments because they are generally short. The second problem is the mixture of opinions from both user comments and the original documents the users commented on. To simultaneously solve the data sparsity problem and explore clean user preferences, we propose an author co-occurring topic model (AOTM) for normal documents and their short user comments. By considering authorship, AOTM allows each author of short texts to have a probability distribution over a set of topics represented only short texts. Accordingly, the individual user preferences can be investigated based on these author-level distributions. We verify the performance of AOTM using two news article datasets and one e-commerce dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the AOTM outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in topic learning and topic representation of documents. The potential usage of AOTM in exploring individual user preferences is further illustrated by drawing user portraits and predicting user posting behaviors.},

	abstract = {Other than banks, non-financial companies also continuously monitor and analyze their credit risk exposure to avoid possible counterparty defaults. Credit default swaps are commonly used financial instruments that provide information on a counterparty's creditworthiness. Although this metric can provide crucial insights, the underlying price dynamics often remain unknown and require further explanation. Data-driven decision-making is a key concept for identifying these reasons and supporting and justifying decisions. In this paper, we provide such justifications by applying sentiment and topic analysis to company-related financial analyst reports. While the contents of financial news have been analyzed in the past, analyst reports can offer additional insights, as seasoned analysts use them to disseminate in-depth research to experienced investors. This analysis examines 3386 analyst reports covering constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index in the period from 2009 to 2020. The results suggest that even when established credit risk indicators and financial news are considered, the sentiment and a subset of topics are correlated with changes in the credit default swap spread, indicating a fundamental relationship between quantitative risk metric and analyst reports. We find that analyst reports contain information related to the change in credit default swap spreads, an insight that helps to improve our understanding of existing risk assessments. The outcome indicates that banks or corporate risk managers can benefit from complementing established financial metrics and even financial news data with new insights derived from analyst reports.},

This paper conducts a topic-based bibliometric study to detect and predict the topic changes of KnoSys from 1991 to 2016. A Latent Dirichlet Allocation model is used to profile the hotspots of KnoSys and predict possible future trends from a probabilistic perspective. A model of scientific evolutionary pathways applies a learning-based process to detect the topic changes of KnoSys in sequential time slices. Six main research areas of KnoSys are identified, i.e., expert systems, machine learning, data mining, decision making, optimization, and fuzzy, and the results also indicate that the interest of KnoSys communities in the area of computational intelligence is raised, and the ability to construct practical systems through knowledge use and accurate prediction models is highly emphasized. Such empirical insights can be used as a guide for KnoSys submissions.},

A text corpus of keywords was generated through a deep keyword generation model from abstracts of 346,387 articles published in 296 disciplines from 1917 to 2021. Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression topic modeling, interdisciplinarity indices, and network analysis were employed to analyze the collected corpus. Topic modeling uncovered 15 dominant research topics in the literacy field, as well as their up-and-down trends from 2000 to 2021. For each topic, keywords were then replaced with disciplines, and interdisciplinarity was measured using four indices: variety, balance, disparity, and diversity. Finally, the interdisciplinarity of each topic, connectivity between topics, and topic trends were comprehensively analyzed on the keyword co-occurrence network. Our methodology reaches beyond connectivity limited to a few disciplines and provides insight into the direction of collaboration between disciplines centered on a research domain. Moreover, the study's deep keyword generation model has methodological implications for forming a corpus spanning numerous disciplines as a bottom-up approach.},

	abstract = {Learning topics from short texts has become a critical and fundamental task for understanding the widely-spread streaming social messages, e.g., tweets, snippets and questions/answers. Up to date, there are two distinctive topic learning schemes: generative probabilistic graphical models and geometrically linear algebra approaches, with LDA and NMF being the representative works, respectively. Since these two methods both could uncover the latent topics hidden in the unstructured short texts, some interesting doubts are coming to our minds that which one is better and why? Are there any other more effective extensions? In order to explore valuable insights between LDA and NMF based learning schemes, we comprehensively conduct a series of experiments into two parts. Specifically, the basic LDA and NMF are compared with different experimental settings on several public short text datasets in the first part which would exhibit that NMF tends to perform better than LDA; in the second part, we propose a novel model called ``Knowledge-guided Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Better Short Text Topic Mining'' (abbreviated as KGNMF), which leverages external knowledge as a semantic regulator with low-rank formalizations, yielding up a time-efficient algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on three representative corpora with currently typical short text topic models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed KGNMF. Overall, learning with NMF-based schemes is another effective manner in short text topic mining in addition to the popular LDA-based paradigms.},

A comparative study of consumers' online review behavior and its impact on overall satisfaction and demand in the accommodation-sharing economy and the hotel industry indicates that consumers' perceptions and behavior change gradually with changes in the level of sharing---from no sharing when staying in hotel rooms to intensive sharing when sharing rooms through collaborative consumption. Online consumer reviews focus on product and service attributes, and the influential factors of customer satisfaction and demand differ when consumers are at different accommodation-sharing levels. Not all attributes described in online reviews influence overall customer satisfaction. With a higher level of sharing, consumers' valuation changes from more to less tangible attributes. Consumers at a higher sharing level care more about social interaction and economic value than consumers at a lower sharing level. Transaction costs, particularly the information search and acquisition costs, play an important role in influencing customer purchase decisions in the sharing economy. Consumers refer to direct information for tangible attributes and to previous consumers' online reviews for intangible attributes to familiarize themselves with details before making purchase decisions. Our study provides implications that help platforms and hosts better target consumer segments with different sharing levels and more effectively utilize online reviews to generate positive electronic word of mouth to enhance consumer demand and the performance of platform economics.},

The proposed NHBT model employs a three-level generation framework based on Dirichlet process to study the impact of intrinsic factors on users topic preference. Our study of Facebook data shows that NHBT model is able to draw valuable latent topics (e.g. music band, chemical biology, cosplay) from the open social media environment, and reveal the internal motivation for users topic selection behaviors (e.g. users with low conscientiousness and high extraversion personality prefer topics about campus party). Our experiments also show that NHBT model can identify the intrinsic factors dominating topic preferences for individual users, and provide foundations to predict the intrinsic factors for new user generated contents.},

@article{alp_2018_identifying_topical_influencers_on_twitter_based_on_user_behavior_and_network_topology,
	abstract = {Social media web sites have become major media platforms to share personal information, news, photos, videos and more. Users can even share live streams whenever they want to reach out to many other. This prevalent usage of social media attracted companies, data scientists, and researchers who are trying to infer meaningful information from this vast amount of data. Information diffusion and maximizing the spread of words is one of the most important focus for researchers working on social media. This information can serve many purposes such as; user or content recommendation, viral marketing, and user modeling. In this research, finding topical influential/authority users on Twitter is addressed. Since Twitter is a good platform to spread knowledge as a word of mouth approach and it has many more public profiles than protected ones, it is a target media for marketers. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology, called Personalized PageRank, that integrates both the information obtained from network topology and the information obtained from user actions and activities in Twitter. The proposed approach aims to determine the topical influencers who are experts on a specific topic. Experimental results on a large dataset consisting of Turkish tweets show that using user specific features like topical focus rate, activeness, authenticity and speed of getting reaction on specific topics positively affects identifying influencers and lead to higher information diffusion. Algorithms are implemented on a distributed computing environment which makes high-cost graph processing more efficient.},

We illustrate a potential approach that uses topic modelling to explore: (a) how scientific publications can be used to describe existing priorities in science production; (b) how policy records (in this case here questions posed in the European parliament) can be used as an instance of mapping discourse of social needs; (c) how the comparison between the two may show (mis)alignments between societal concerns and scientific outputs. While this is a technical exercise, we propose that this type of mapping methods can be useful to domain experts for informing strategic planning and evaluation in funding agencies.},

	abstract = {Prevalent usage of social media attracted companies and researchers to analyze its dynamics and effects on user behavior. One of the most intriguing aspects of social networks is to identify influencers who are experts on a specific topic. With the identification of these users within the network, many applications can be built for user recommendation, information diffusion modeling, viral marketing, user modeling and many more. In this paper, we aim to identify topic-based experts using a large dataset collected from Twitter. Our proposed approach has three phases: (1) identification of topics on social media posts (more specifically, tweets), (2) user modeling, based on a group of user specific features, and (3) Influence Factorization to identify topical influencers. The main advantage of the proposed method is to identify future influencers as well as current ones on Twitter. Moreover, it is an easy to implement algorithm using Spark MLlib, which can be easily extended to include other user specific features, and compare with other methodologies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on a large dataset that contains tweets of 180K user over 70 day period. The experimental results show that our proposed method identifies influencers successfully when used with a hybrid user specific feature that contains follower count and authenticity information, and is a highly scalable and extensible algorithm.},

@article{amon_2022_is_it_all_bafflegab____linguistic_and_meta_characteristics_of_research_articles_in_prestigious_economics_journals,
	abstract = {In competitive research environments, scholars have a natural interest to maximize the prestige associated with their scientific work. In order to identify factors that might help them address this goal more effectively, the scientometric literature has tried to link linguistic and meta characteristics of academic papers to the associated degree of scientific prestige, conceptualized as cumulative citation counts. In this paper, we take an alternative approach that instead understands scientific prestige in terms of the rankings of the journals that the articles appeared in, as such rankings are routinely used as surrogate research quality indicators. For the purpose of determining the most important drivers of suchlike prestige, we use state-of-the-art text mining tools to extract 344 interpretable features from a large corpus of over 200,000 journal articles in economics. We then estimate beta regression models to investigate the relationship between these predictors and a cross-sectionally standardized version of SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) in multiple topically homogeneous clusters. In so doing, we also reinvestigate the bafflegab theory, according to which more prestigious research papers tend to be less readable, in a methodologically novel way. Our results show the consistently most informative predictors to be associated with the length of the paper, the span of coreference chains in its full text, the deployment of a personal and moderately informal writing style, the ``density'' of the article in terms of sentences per page, international and institutional collaboration in research teams and the references cited in the paper. Moreover, we identify various linguistic intricacies that matter in the association between readability and scientific prestige, which suggest this relationship to be more complicated than previously assumed.},

During recent years, Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) providers, such as Coursera or edX, are reporting millions of new users signing up on their platforms. Though online review systems are standard among many verticals, no standardized or fully decentralized review systems exist in the MOOC ecosystem. In this vein, we believe that there is an opportunity to leverage available open MOOC reviews in order to build simpler and more transparent reviewing systems, allowing users to really identify the best courses out there. Specifically, in our research we analyze 2.4 million reviews (which is the largest MOOC reviews dataset used until now) from five different platforms in order to determine the following: (1) if the numeric ratings provide discriminant information to learners, (2) if NLP-driven sentiment analysis on textual reviews could provide valuable information to learners, (3) if we can leverage NLP-driven topic finding techniques to infer themes that could be important for learners, and (4) if we can use these models to effectively characterize MOOCs based on the open reviews. Results show that numeric ratings are clearly biased (63% of them are 5-star ratings), and the topic modeling reveals some interesting topics related with course advertisements, the real applicability, or the difficulty of the different courses.},

	abstract = {The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), created by congress in 2011, receives and processes consumer complaints pertaining to various financial services. Every complaint narrative provides insight into problems that consumers are experiencing. With increasing number of the CFPB complaint narratives, manual review of these documents by human experts is not feasible. This requires an intelligent system to analyze narratives automatically and provide insightful knowledge to the experts. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to analyze the CFPB consumer complaints. The proposed approach aims to extract latent topics in the CFPB complaint narratives, and explores their associated trends over time. The time trends will then be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the CFPB regulations and expectations on financial institutions in creating a consumer oriented culture. The technology-human partnership between the proposed approach and the CFPB experts could certainly improve consumer experience by providing more efficient and effective investigations of consumer complaint narratives.},

	abstract = {Document representation plays an important role in the fields of text mining, natural language processing, and information retrieval. Traditional approaches to document representation may suffer from the disregard of the correlations or order of words in a document, due to unrealistic assumption of word independence or exchangeability. Recently, long--short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural networks have been shown effective in preserving local contextual sequential patterns of words in a document, but using the LSTM model alone may not be adequate to capture global topical semantics for learning document representation. In this work, we propose a new topic-enhanced LSTM model to deal with the document representation problem. We first employ an attention-based LSTM model to generate hidden representation of word sequence in a given document. Then, we introduce a latent topic modeling layer with similarity constraint on the local hidden representation, and build a tree-structured LSTM on top of the topic layer for generating semantic representation of the document. We evaluate our model in typical text mining applications, i.e., document classification, topic detection, information retrieval, and document clustering. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the benefit of our innovations over state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

	abstract = {In this work, we cope with the classification of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in Spanish according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). We employ Topic Models representing each document as a probabilistic distribution over topics, offering a low-dimensional representation of documents. The trend is to turn to an embedding text representation, but these approaches require large amounts of textual data. We found Topic Models as a suitable alternative approach to deal with the few resources available for Spanish clinical text mining. Besides, they are interpretable and aid the explainability in artificial intelligence (XAI). We explored two different methods, known as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Partially Labelled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (PLDA), the supervised approach of the former. We assessed the results attained in Spanish with an analogous task in English as a reference. Evaluation methods were applied directly to the representation, with metrics to determine topic coherence and the relationship between topics and ICD labels. We learned that PLDA was able to discover topics associated with the ICD. This finding means that this representation itself can reveal ICD codes previous to classification. Also, this representation was used as predictive features to feed a conventional classifier to show their competence in a downstream task. We conclude that in a context with a lack of big data availability, PLDA emerges as a versatile candidate, able to offer a competitive representation of EHRs. While other works are primarily concerned with supervised categorization and do not pay attention to the representation, LDA and PLDA offer an interpretable approach that can be associated with ICDs. Moreover, compared with those that employ LDA, we demonstrate how its' supervised version, PLDA, can be more intuitive as it shows a closer relation with the ICDs.},

	abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have been widely disseminated due to the arrival of Web 2.0. However, the growth of MOOCs brings some difficulties for students in choosing suitable courses in these ecosystems. In recent years, some recommendation systems emerged to solve this problem but remain limited since they do not identify the student's prior knowledge broadly or the student's goals. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes the Fragmented Recommendation for MOOCs Ecosystems (FReME), a recommendation system to suggest parts of courses from multiple providers (i.e., Khan Academy, Udemy, and edX). FReME is based on the student profile and on the MOOCs ecosystems perspective to balance the ecological environment and strengthen interactions. Moreover, we differ from the current recommendation systems since our method identifies and reduces the students' knowledge gap optimizing the learning process. Experimental results conducted with a dataset integrating 3 MOOCs providers and 19 students demonstrated that the implemented techniques are more consistent than other approaches. Finally, it was verified through precision, utility, novelty, and confidence that our recommendations are 62,24% accurate, 68.89% useful, 72.81% reliable, and present new content in 99.12% of cases. These results validate that FReME supports students in reducing their knowledge gap.},

Although recognition works on mathematical expressions have been explored for four decades, the current literature and trends are varied and frequently influenced by distinct emerging methods and technology. This situation instigates the necessity of an organized review to provide heedful insight into research trends and patterns currently prevailing in the domain of mathematical expression recognition (MER).
Objective
To identify and associate (semantic mapping) the leading research zones, core research areas, and research trends steering in the MER domain. Identifying prominent recognition models based on extracted research areas. To develop the development chart from extracted research trends for directing the future works in this direction.
Method
A manual and automatic search has been performed across the reputed digital libraries for corpus formation. The formulated corpus is used for topic modeling, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation is deployed for information modeling for achieving defined objectives.
Result
The corpus of 325 research papers published from 1967 to 2021 has been processed using LDA. The five major research areas and ten research trends are identified. Leading research area is ``Segmentation and Classification Procedures'', and the trend with the highest related publications is ``Contextual and Graph-based recognition''. ``Attention and Deep Networks'' has emerged as the newborn trend, and the identified newborn, young, and matured trends impetrate more exploration from the MER research community.},

	abstract = {Due to the huge size of the data accumulated on microblogging sites, recently, two fundamental questions have become very popular: 1) What percentage of this accumulated data has positive or negative sentiment polarity? 2) How is the distribution of this accumulated data on different topics? Inspired by these motivated necessities, this paper presents several different algorithms which are based on the Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) in order to handle previously mentioned two fundamentals tasks: sentiment polarity detection task and topic-based text classification task. These algorithms are the Label Propagated- Relevance Frequency Classifier (LP-RFC) and LP-Abstract Frequency Classifier (LP-AFC). These algorithms can be defined as new semantic smoothing classifiers, which take advantage of the semantic connections among terms in the label propagation phase of the LPA. Additionally, another classifier, namely LP-ComRFC+AFC, was built. LP-ComRFC+AFC is actually a weighted summation classifier of the individual LP-RFC and LP-AFC. Furthermore, considering the shortage of labeled data in real-world scenarios, a semi-supervised version of LP-RFC and LP-AFC, namely ``Merging Unlabeled and Labeled Instances with Semantic Values of Terms'' (MULIS), was designed and implemented. For the experiments of the sentiment polarity detection task, three different datasets were use and for the experiments of topic-based text classification task, a self-collected tweet dataset was use. According to the experimental results, the suggested algorithms, and their composite form, LP-ComRFC+AFC, generated higher F1 scores than all of the baseline algorithms at nearly all of the training splits on the datasets.},

@article{goldberg_2022_sourcing_product_innovation_intelligence_from_online_reviews,
	abstract = {In recent years, online reviews have offered a rich new medium for consumers to express their opinions and feedback. Product designers frequently aim to consider consumer preferences in their work, but many firms are unsure of how best to harness this online feedback given that textual data is both unstructured and voluminous. In this study, we use text mining tools to propose a method for rapid prioritization of online reviews, differentiating the reviews pertaining to innovation opportunities that are most useful for firms. We draw from the innovation and entrepreneurship literature and provide an empirical basis for the widely accepted attribute mapping framework, which delineates between desirable product attributes that firms may want to capitalize upon and undesirable attributes that they may need to remedy. Based on a large sample of reviews in the countertop appliances industry, we demonstrate the performance of our technique, which offers statistically significant improvements relative to existing methods. We validate the usefulness of our technique by asking senior managers at a large manufacturing firm to rate a selection of online reviews, and we show that the selected attribute types are more useful than alternative reviews. Our results offer insight in how firms may use online reviews to harness vital consumer feedback.},

@article{gregoriades_2021_supporting_digital_content_marketing_and_messaging_through_topic_modelling_and_decision_trees,
	abstract = {This paper presents a machine learning approach involving tourists' electronic word of mouth (eWOM) to support destination marketing campaigns. This approach enhances optimisation of a critical aspect of marketing campaigns, that is, the communication of the right content to the right consumers. The proposed method further considers aggregate cultural and economic-related information of the tourists' country of origin with topic modelling and Decision Tree (DT) models. Each DT addresses different dimensions of culture and purchasing power and the way these dimensions are associated with the topics discussed in eWOM, thus revealing patterns relating tourists' experiences with potential explanations for their dissatisfaction/satisfaction. The method is implemented in a case study in the context of tourism in Cyprus focusing on two hotel groups (2/3 and 4/5 stars) to account for their differences. Patterns emerged from the extraction of rules from DTs illuminate combinations of variables associated with tourist experience (negative or positive) for each of the two hotel categories and verify the asymmetric relationship between service performance and satisfaction. The approach can be used by management during marketing campaigns to design messages to better address the desires and needs of tourists from different cultural and economic backgrounds, as these emerge from the data analysis.},

@article{wahid_2022_topic2labels_a_framework_to_annotate_and_classify_the_social_media_data_through_lda_topics_and_deep_learning_models_for_crisis_response,
	abstract = {The abundant use of social media impacts every aspect of life, including crisis management. Disaster management needs real-time data to be used in machine learning and deep learning models to aid their decision making. Mostly the data that is newly generated from social media is unstructured and unlabeled. Current text classification models based on supervised deep learning models heavily rely on human-labeled data that very small size and imbalanced in the context of disasters, ultimately affecting the generalization of models. In this study, we propose Topic2labels (T2L) framework which provides an automated way of labeling the data through LDA (latent dirichlet allocation) topic modeling approach and utilize Bert (the bidirectional encoder representation from transformer) embeddings for construction of feature vector to be employed to classify the data contextually. Our framework consists of three layers. In the first layer, we adopt LDA to generate the topics from the data, and develop a new algorithm to rank the topics, and map the highest ranked dominant topic into label to annotate the data. In the second layer, we transform the labeled text into feature representation through Bert embeddings and in the third layer we leveraged deep learning models as classifiers to classify the textual data into multiple categories. Experimental results on crisis-related datasets show that our framework performs better in terms of classification performance and yields improvement as compared to other baseline approaches.},

	abstract = {In the modern world, science and technology jointly determine the evolutionary path of scientific innovation, with an increasingly close relationship between them. Therefore, it is important to study the identification method of the innovation path, based on the linkage of topics in science and technology. This study focuses on connected topics utilizing bibliometric analysis, thereby exploring the identification method for innovation paths based on the linkage of scientific and technological topics. The internal mechanism of knowledge dissemination and the relationship between science and technology are revealed and described in detail by measuring the linkage of knowledge units. For practical bibliometric analyses, research papers and patent literature were used to characterize scientific research and technological research to reveal the innovation path for the interaction of science and technology quantitatively, automatically, and visually. Experimental study shows that analysis of the topic-linked path of science and technology, along with the integration of multi-relationships, can effectively identify important science- and technology-related topics in a field in the evolution process, and help grasp the key points of basic research and applied research.},

Supervised approaches for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis achieve good results for the domain and language they are trained on, but manually labelling data to train supervised systems for all domains and languages is very costly and time consuming. In this work, we describe W2VLDA, an almost unsupervised system based on topic modelling that, combined with some other unsupervised methods and a minimal configuration step, performs aspect category classification, aspect-term and opinion-word separation and sentiment polarity classification for any given domain and language. We evaluate its domain aspect and sentiment classification performance in the multilingual SemEval 2016 task 5 (ABSA) dataset. We show competitive results for several domains (hotels, restaurants, electronic devices) and languages (English, Spanish, French and Dutch).},

@article{kim_2020_word2vec_based_latent_semantic_analysis_w2v_lsa_for_topic_modeling_a_study_on_blockchain_technology_trend_analysis,
	abstract = {Blockchain has become one of the core technologies in Industry 4.0. To help decision-makers establish action plans based on blockchain, it is an urgent task to analyze trends in blockchain technology. However, most of existing studies on blockchain trend analysis are based on effort demanding full-text investigation or traditional bibliometric methods whose study scope is limited to a frequency-based statistical analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new topic modeling method called Word2vec-based Latent Semantic Analysis (W2V-LSA), which is based on Word2vec and Spherical k-means clustering to better capture and represent the context of a corpus. We then used W2V-LSA to perform an annual trend analysis of blockchain research by country and time for 231 abstracts of blockchain-related papers published over the past five years. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to Probabilistic LSA, one of the common topic modeling techniques. The experimental results confirmed the usefulness of W2V-LSA in terms of the accuracy and diversity of topics by quantitative and qualitative evaluation. The proposed method can be a competitive alternative for better topic modeling to provide direction for future research in technology trend analysis and it is applicable to various expert systems related to text mining.},
