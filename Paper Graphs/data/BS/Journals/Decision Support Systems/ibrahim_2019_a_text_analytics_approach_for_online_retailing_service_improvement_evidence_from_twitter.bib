	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to focus on the application and exploitation of Big Data (BD) to create competitive advantage. It presents a framework of application areas, and how they help the understanding of targeting and scoping specific areas for sustainable improvement. Empirical evidence demonstrates the application of BD in practice and tests the framework. Design/methodology/approach An exploratory approach is adopted to the secondary research which examines vendors'offerings. The empirical research used the case study method. Findings The findings indicate that there is opportunity to create sustainable competitive advantage through the application of BD. However there are social, technological and human consequences that are only now beginning to emerge which need to be addressed if true long-term advantage is to be achieved. Research limitations/implications The research develops a framework and tests it only in two dimensions. This should be expanded. The vendor analysis limitations lie within the nature of the information available and the difficulties in mitigating against bias. Practical implications The suggested framework can help academics and managers to identify areas of opportunity to do so, setting new levels of performance and new agendas for business. Originality/value This work contributes to service operations management, building on Kranzberg (1986) and the impact of technology and on Fosso Wamba et al. (2015) by developing a systems application framework to further understanding of BD from a practical perspective to extend their research taxonomy insights. The case studies demonstrate how the use of BD enhances operational performance.},

@article{ramanathan_2017_role_of_social_media_in_retail_network_operations_and_marketing_to_enhance_customer_satisfaction,
	abstract = {Purpose The technology evolution compels retail networks to introduce unique business models to retain customers and to gain a competitive advantage. Customer reviews available through social media need to be taken into account by retail networks to design a model with unique service operations and marketing approaches that will improve loyalty by adding value to customers. Furthermore, the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer spending behaviour is very weak and needs further investigation. Hence the purpose of this paper is to understand how retail network leverage the potential of social media reviews along with unique service operations to satisfy customers. The study analyses the nexus of: a brand, promotional offers, service operations; and their interaction through social media reviews on customer satisfaction levels. Design/methodology/approach The authors develop a conceptual model for the social media era. The authors combine the idea of loyalty- and value-based models of Chatterjee (2013). The authors employed a survey questionnaire method to elicit opinions of retail customer satisfaction based on social media reviews, service operations and marketing efforts. The authors derive measures of the model from existing literature and expert opinion. Findings Social media reviews dramatically impact upon customer satisfaction. Similarly the empirical analysis identifies the significant and positive role played by service operations in customer satisfaction levels. Interestingly the authors did not find unequivocal support for brand satisfaction impacting on customer satisfaction. However, when promotions interact well with service operations, the level of customer satisfaction is significantly affected. Similarly the authors did not observe a positive outcome when there is an interaction between promotion and social media reviews. After reading the reviews, some potential buyers make a visit to store before making final decisions and surprisingly, promotional effects do not change their mind set. Practical implications Research findings confirm the importance of social media reviews, marketing and interaction between promotion and service operations enabling retail networks to build loyalty and value-based models. Based on customer behaviour, the study suggests a need to consider operational efficiencies when promoting sales; through careful planning, customer satisfaction and profitability levels can be increased. This sends a strong message to the retail network to defend their position within a very competitive business market. Originality/value The empirical evidence based on customer experience would be helpful for companies in integrating their operations and marketing efforts enabling them to convert different segment of customers such as ``free riders (higher satisfaction and low profitability)''and ``vulnerable customers (low satisfaction and higher profitability)''into ``star customers (higher satisfaction and high profitability)''. Through a considered approach: combining social media reviews, marketing and operations, businesses will be better-placed to survive in the ultra-competitive social media-influenced era.},

@article{xu_2017_business_intelligence_in_online_customer_textual_reviews_understanding_consumer_perceptions_and_influential_factors,
	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, customers not only shop online---they also post reviews on social media. This user-generated content (UGC) can be useful to understand customers' shopping experiences and influence future customers' purchase intentions. Therefore, business intelligence and analytics are increasingly being advocated as a way to analyze customers' UGC in social media and support firms' marketing activities. However, because of its open structure, UGC such as customer reviews can be difficult to analyze, and firms find it challenging to harness UGC. To fill this gap, this study aims to examine customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction toward attributes of hotel products and services based on online customer textual reviews. Using a text mining approach, latent semantic analysis (LSA), we identify the key attributes driving customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction toward hotel products and service attributes. Additionally, using a regression approach, we examine the effects of travel purposes, hotel types, star level, and editor recommendations on customers' perceptions of attributes of hotel products and services. This study bridges customer online textual reviews with customers' perceptions to help business managers better understand customers' needs through UGC.},

@article{wiener_2018_omnichannel_businesses_in_the_publishing_and_retailing_industries_synergies_and_tensions_between_coexisting_online_and_offline_business_models,
	abstract = {Since the emergence of the Internet, many brick-and-mortar companies from various industries have established an online business model (BM) alongside their traditional offline BM. Despite the increasing coexistence of online and offline BMs within a single company, however, most prior research has focused on studying online and offline BMs in isolation. Consequently, still little is known about the interplay of dual BMs in omnichannel businesses. We address this research gap through an empirical investigation of the synergies and tensions that arise from coexisting online and offline BMs as well as the factors that influence the emergence of such synergies and tensions. Drawing on a series of six case studies with three publishers and three retailers, we identify an extended set of BM synergies and tensions, which concern all major BM dimensions. In addition, our case analysis reveals that companies are able to exploit different synergies, but also face different tensions between their online and offline BMs. The observed differences can be traced back to the level of online-offline BM integration, online-offline product distinctions (e.g., in terms of product content and publication cycles), and general organization context factors (e.g., offline brand strength, organization structure). By uncovering both the benefits and the complexity of running online and offline BMs in parallel, our study contributes to the theoretical understanding of omnichannel businesses, and provides managers with practical guidance on how to design, integrate, and manage their dual BMs successfully.},

	abstract = {This study aims at understanding the role of customer engagement in writing online reviews by shoppers with specific focus on mobile devices for shopping. Mobile devices are becoming first screen for the customers and are being used by marketers to have interactive communication making it more suitable for building customer engagement. The research in this space however is in a very nascent stage. Current study is one of the first few empirical studies exploring the role of customer engagement in writing online reviews. The study explores mediating role of customer engagement in satisfaction - online review intention and trust - online review intention relationships. Further moderating role of trust and satisfaction levels in customer engagement - online review intention is explored. This study contributes to marketing literature in the space of customer engagement, online reviews and mobile shopping behaviour. Further, this study provides a framework to managers for motivating the customers in writing online reviews. Also recommendations for retailers in exploiting customer engagement on mobile platforms are provided to address merchants and advertisers for better management of a new technology.},

@article{sheng_2017_a_multidisciplinary_perspective_of_big_data_in_management_research,
	abstract = {In recent years, big data has emerged as one of the prominent buzzwords in business and management. In spite of the mounting body of research on big data across the social science disciplines, scholars have offered little synthesis on the current state of knowledge. To take stock of academic research that contributes to the big data revolution, this paper tracks scholarly work's perspectives on big data in the management domain over the past decade. We identify key themes emerging in management studies and develop an integrated framework to link the multiple streams of research in fields of organisation, operations, marketing, information management and other relevant areas. Our analysis uncovers a growing awareness of big data's business values and managerial changes led by data-driven approach. Stemming from the review is the suggestion for research that both structured and unstructured big data should be harnessed to advance understanding of big data value in informing organisational decisions and enhancing firm competitiveness. To discover the full value, firms need to formulate and implement a data-driven strategy. In light of these, the study identifies and outlines the implications and directions for future research.},

It has changed the way how online community interacts and somehow has led to a new trend of engagement for online retailers especially on microblogging websites such as Twitter. In this study, we investigated the impact of online retailers' engagement with the online brand communities on users' perception of brand image and service. Firstly, we analysed the overall sentiment trends of different brands and the patterns of engagement between companies and customers using the collected tweets posted on a popular social media platform, Twitter. Then, we studied how different types of engagements affect customer sentiments. Our analysis shows that engagement has an effect on sentiments that associate with brand image, perception and customer service of the online retailers. Our findings indicate that the level, length, type and attitude of retailers' engagement with social media users have a significant impact on their sentiments. Based on our results, we derived several important managerial and practical implications.},

Much of the increase in data quality and application possibilities comes from a mix of new data sources, a smart application of statistical tools and domain knowledge combined with theoretical insights. The importance of theory in guiding any systematic search for answers to retailing questions, as well as for streamlining analysis remains undiminished, even as the role of big data and predictive analytics in retailing is set to rise in importance, aided by newer sources of data and large-scale correlational techniques. The Statistical issues discussed include a particular focus on the relevance and uses of Bayesian analysis techniques (data borrowing, updating, augmentation and hierarchical modeling), predictive analytics using big data and a field experiment, all in a retailing context. Finally, the ethical and privacy issues that may arise from the use of big data in retailing are also highlighted.},
