@inproceedings{alrashdi_2020_robust_domain_adaptation_approach_for_tweet_classification_for_crisis_response,
	abstract = {Information posted by people on Twitter during crises can significantly improve crisis response towards reducing human and financial loss. Deep learning algorithms can identify related tweets to reduce information overloaded which prevents humanitarian organizations from using Twitter posts. However, they heavily rely on labeled data which is unavailable for emerging crises. And because each crisis has its own features such as location, occurring time and social media response, current models are known to suffer from generalizing to unseen disaster events when pretrained on past ones. To solve this problem, we propose a domain adaptation approach that makes use of a distant supervision-based framework to label the unlabeled data from emerging crises. Then, pseudo-labeled target data, along with labeled-data from similar past disasters, are used to build the target model. Our results show that our approach can be seen as a general robust method to classify unseen tweets from current events.},

@inproceedings{chen_2017_automatically_labeled_data_generation_for_large_scale_event_extraction,
	abstract = {Modern models of event extraction for tasks like ACE are based on supervised learning of events from small hand-labeled data. However, hand-labeled training data is expensive to produce, in low coverage of event types, and limited in size, which makes supervised methods hard to extract large scale of events for knowledge base population. To solve the data labeling problem, we propose to automatically label training data for event extraction via world knowledge and linguistic knowledge, which can detect key arguments and trigger words for each event type and employ them to label events in texts automatically. The experimental results show that the quality of our large scale automatically labeled data is competitive with elaborately human-labeled data. And our automatically labeled data can incorporate with human-labeled data, then improve the performance of models learned from these data.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to present an experiment developed in order to produce a corpus with automated annotation, using pre-existing annotated corpus and machine learning classification methods. A search for pre-existing annotated corpora in Brazilian Portuguese was applied, founding six corpora of which one has been selected as the training dataset. A set of tweets was collected in a specific area of Recife (Pernambuco-Brazil) using some keywords related to kinds of crimes and reinforcing some places in that area. Preprocessing tasks were applied over the pre-existing corpus and the tweets' set collected. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was applied for topic modeling followed by Multinomial Na{\"\i}ve Bayes, Linear Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression for the sentiment polarity classification. The results of the cross-validation of the experiment indicated Linear Support Vector Machines as the most accurate classification method among the three considering the specific training set used, and by this method, the new annotated corpus about the selected topic related to public security was created.},

@article{madichetty_2020_classifying_informative_and_non_informative_tweets_from_the_twitter_by_adapting_image_features_during_disaster,
	abstract = {During the crisis, people post a large number of informative and non-informative tweets on Twitter. Informative tweets provide helpful information such as affected individuals, infrastructure damage, availability and resource requirements, etc. In contrast, non-informative tweets do not provide helpful information related to either humanitarian organizations or victims. Identifying informative tweets is a challenging task during the disaster. People often post images along with text on Twitter during the disaster. In addition to tweet text features, image features are also crucial for identifying informative tweets. However, existing methods use only text features but do not use image features to identify crisis-related tweets during the disaster. This paper proposes a novel approach by considering the image features along with the text features. It includes a text-based classification model, an image-based classification model and a late fusion. The text-based classification model uses the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). CNN is used to extract text features from a tweet and the ANN is used to classify tweets based on extracted text features of CNN. The image-based classification model uses the fine-tuned VGG-16 architecture to extract the image features from the image and classify the image in a tweet. The output of the text-based classification model and the image-based classification model are combined using the late fusion technique to predict the tweet label. Extensive experiments are carried out on Twitter datasets of various crises, such as the Mexico earthquake, California Wildfires, etc., to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various parameters to identify informative tweets during the disaster.},
