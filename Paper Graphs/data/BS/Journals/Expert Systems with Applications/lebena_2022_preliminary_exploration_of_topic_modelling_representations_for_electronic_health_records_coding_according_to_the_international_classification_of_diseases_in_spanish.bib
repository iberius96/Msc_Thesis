	abstract = {Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications on real-life textual content require a suitable fit for purpose corpora, which can accommodate the ambiguity of the domain. Researchers in the field managed to synthesize gold-standard corpora in many domains and for varying tasks, assisted by domain experts and linguists. The wealth of information buried in free-text electronic documents in healthcare systems presents itself as a leading contender for NLP applications. In this literature review, the efforts to come up and utilize a clinically annotated corpus in a particular healthcare information extraction task are explored. Those efforts can be more pronounced when done on a new language with limited existing gold-standard clinical references. A great number of people around the globe interact with healthcare systems in languages other than English. Advancing the Clinical NLP research in their languages will propel the general progress in the field and potential healthcare advantages considerably. For the purposes of this review, we considered three major world languages: Spanish, Italian, and Chinese. This led to considering the research question to be about the viability of the creation or utilization of a gold-standard clinical corpus in a language other than English and how it can contribute in performing a complex clinical language mining task. The implementations reviewed in these languages considered varying approaches to overcome complexities in biomedical NLP in these languages. This study managed to highlight novel solutions to complex tasks and found that efforts in these languages can be highly successful if a non-English medical corpus is created from scratch, off-the-shelf tools are used or machine translation is considered to bridge the gap in biomedical NLP domain-specific lingual resources in these languages.},

@inproceedings{devlin_2019_bert_pre_training_of_deep_bidirectional_transformers_for_language_understanding,
	abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

@article{gangavarapu_2020_predicting_icd_9_code_groups_with_fuzzy_similarity_based_supervised_multi_label_classification_of_unstructured_clinical_nursing_notes,
	abstract = {In hospitals, caregivers are trained to chronicle the subtle changes in the clinical conditions of a patient at regular intervals, for enabling decision-making. Caregivers' text-based clinical notes are a significant source of rich patient-specific data, that can facilitate effective clinical decision support, despite which, this treasure-trove of data remains largely unexplored for supporting the prediction of clinical outcomes. The application of sophisticated data modeling and prediction algorithms with greater computational capacity have made disease prediction from raw clinical notes a relevant problem. In this paper, we propose an approach based on vector space and topic modeling, to structure the raw clinical data by capturing the semantic information in the nursing notes. Fuzzy similarity based data cleansing approach was used to merge anomalous and redundant patient data. Furthermore, we utilize eight supervised multi-label classification models to facilitate disease (ICD-9 code group) prediction. We present an exhaustive comparative study to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches using standard evaluation metrics. Experimental validation on MIMIC-III, an open database, underscored the superior performance of the proposed Term weighting of unstructured notes AGgregated using fuzzy Similarity (TAGS) model, which consistently outperformed the state-of-the-art structured data based approach by 7.79% in AUPRC and 1.24% in AUROC.},

@inproceedings{goeuriot_2020_overview_of_the_clef_ehealth_evaluation_lab_2020,
	abstract = {In this paper, we provide an overview of the eight annual edition of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) eHealth evaluation lab. The Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) eHealth 2020 continues our development of evaluation tasks and resources since 2012 to address laypeople's difficulties to retrieve and digest valid and relevant information in their preferred language to make health-centred decisions. This year's lab advertised two tasks. Task 1 on Information Extraction (IE) was new and focused on automatic clinical coding of diagnosis and procedure the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD10) codes as well as finding the corresponding evidence text snippets for clinical case documents in Spanish. Task 2 on Information Retrieval (IR) was a novel extension of the most popular and established task in the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) eHealth on Consumer Health Search (CHS). In total 55 submissions were made to these tasks. Herein, we describe the resources created for the two tasks and evaluation methodology adopted. We also summarize lab submissions and results. As in previous years, the organizers have made data and tools associated with the lab tasks available for future research and development. The ongoing substantial community interest in the tasks and their resources has led to the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) eHealth maturing as a primary venue for all interdisciplinary actors of the ecosystem for producing, processing, and consuming electronic health information.},

	abstract = {Distributed vector representations or embeddings map variable length text to dense fixed length vectors as well as capture prior knowledge which can transferred to downstream tasks. Even though embeddings have become de facto standard for text representation in deep learning based NLP tasks in both general and clinical domains, there is no survey paper which presents a detailed review of embeddings in Clinical Natural Language Processing. In this survey paper, we discuss various medical corpora and their characteristics, medical codes and present a brief overview as well as comparison of popular embeddings models. We classify clinical embeddings and discuss each embedding type in detail. We discuss various evaluation methods followed by possible solutions to various challenges in clinical embeddings. Finally, we conclude with some of the future directions which will advance research in clinical embeddings.},
