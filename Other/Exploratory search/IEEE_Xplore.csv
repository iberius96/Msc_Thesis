"TLATR: Automatic Topic Labeling Using Automatic (Domain-Specific) Term Recognition","C. -O. Truică; E. -S.

Topic labeling is used to assign meaningful labels for the discovered topics. In this paper, we present a new topic labeling method that uses automatic term recognition to discover and assign relevant labels for each topic, i.e., TLATR (Topic Labeling using Automatic Term Recognition). TLATR uses domain-specific multi-terms that appear in the set of documents belonging to a topic. The multi-term having the highest score as determined by the automatic term recognition algorithm is chosen as the label for that topic. To evaluate TLATR, we use two real, publicly available datasets that contain scientific articles' abstracts. The topic label evaluation is done both automatically and using human annotators. For the automatic evaluation, we use Pointwise Mutual Information, Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information, and document similarity. For human evaluation, we employ the average rating method. Furthermore, we also evaluate the quality of the topic models using the Adjusted Rand Index. To prove that our novel method extracts relevant topic labels, we compare TLATR with two state-of-the-art methods, one supervised and one unsupervised, provided by the NETL Automatic Topic Labelling system. The experimental results show that our method outperforms or provides similar results with both NETL's supervised and unsupervised approaches.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3083000","University Politehnica of Bucharest through the PubArt Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439519","Automatic term recognition;automatic topic labeling evaluation;topic labeling;topic modeling","Labeling;Task analysis;Mutual information;Semantics;Indexes;Computational modeling;Bit error rate","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;text analysis","adjusted Rand index;topic modeling;NETL automatic topic labelling system;topic label evaluation;automatic term recognition algorithm;domain-specific multiterms;topic labeling method;latent topics;probabilistic graphical model;TLATR","","","","63","CCBY","24 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When topic models are used for discovery of topics in text collections, a question that arises naturally is how well the model-induced topics correspond to topics of interest to the analyst. In this paper we revisit and extend a so far neglected approach to topic model evaluation based on measuring topic coverage – computationally matching model topics with a set of reference topics that models are expected to uncover. The approach is well suited for analyzing models’ performance in topic discovery and for large-scale analysis of both topic models and measures of model quality. We propose new measures of coverage and evaluate, in a series of experiments, different types of topic models on two distinct text domains for which interest for topic discovery exists. The experiments include evaluation of model quality, analysis of coverage of distinct topic categories, and the analysis of the relationship between coverage and other methods of topic model evaluation. The paper contributes a new supervised measure of coverage, and the first unsupervised measure of coverage. The supervised measure achieves topic matching accuracy close to human agreement. The unsupervised measure correlates highly with the supervised one (Spearman’s  $\rho \geq 0.95$ ). Other contributions include insights into both topic models and different methods of model evaluation, and the datasets and code for facilitating future research on topic coverage.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3109425","European Regional Development Fund(grant numbers:KK.01.1.1.01.0009 (DATACROSS)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9526605","Topic coverage;topic coherence;topic discovery;topic models;topic model evaluation;topic model stability","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Data models;Tools;Stability criteria;Adaptation models","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","reference topics;model topics;model-induced topics;topic coverage approach;topic model evaluation;distinct topic categories;model quality;topic discovery","","1","","98","CCBY","31 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, they only react to predefined wordings and do not actually grasp the user's intent. To overcome this limitation, a system must grasp the topics the user is talking about. Therefore, we apply unsupervised multi-topic labeling to spoken utterances. Although topic labeling is a well-studied task on textual documents, its potential for spoken input is almost unexplored. Our approach for topic labeling is tailored to spoken utterances; it copes with short and ungrammatical input. The approach is two-tiered. First, we disambiguate word senses. We utilize Wikipedia as pre-labeled corpus to train a naïve-bayes classifier. Second, we build topic graphs based on DBpedia relations. We use two strategies to determine central terms in the graphs, i.e. the shared topics. One focuses on the dominant senses in the utterance and the other covers as many distinct senses as possible. Our approach creates multiple distinct topics per utterance and ranks results. The evaluation shows that the approach is feasible; the word sense disambiguation achieves a recall of 0.799. Concerning topic labeling, in a user study subjects assessed that in 90.9% of the cases at least one proposed topic label among the first four is a good fit. With regard to precision, the subjects judged that 77.2% of the top ranked labels are a good fit or good but somewhat too broad (Fleiss' kappa k = 0.27).","","978-1-7281-4125-1","10.1109/HCC46620.2019.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8940820","Topic Labeling, Topic Modeling, Unsupervised Machine Learning, Graph Centrality Measures, Word Sense Disambiguation, DBpedia, Wikipedia, Semantic Annotation, Spoken Language Interfaces, Spoken Language Understanding, Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Understanding","Labeling;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet;Adaptation models","Bayes methods;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;text analysis;Web sites","naïve-bayes classifier;Wikipedia;word sense disambiguation;multiple distinct topics;topic graphs;topic labeling;spoken utterances;unsupervised multitopic labeling","","1","","28","","27 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mining text to discover the hidden semantic structure; topics in a text body is a typical topic modeling application. Numerous techniques fall under topic modeling including Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is considered the most prevalent topic modeling method and has substantially evolved from where it had begun. LDA now has transformed into many variants such as Hierarchical LDA Model (hLDA), Dynamic Topic Model (DTM), Correlated Topic Model (CTM), Pachinko Allocation Topic Model (PAM), and Author Topic Model. Through this paper, LDA, its advancements, and its applications are being assessed and analyzed.","","978-1-6654-9602-5","10.1109/COM-IT-CON54601.2022.9850912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9850912","Topic Modeling;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Evolution of LDA;Hierarchical Topic Model;Dynamic Topic Model;Correlated Topic Model;Pachinko Allocation Topic Model;and Author Topic Model","Text mining;Analytical models;Machine learning algorithms;Correlation;Computational modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Semantics","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;natural language processing;probability;text analysis;unsupervised learning","unsupervised machine learning techniques;mining text;hidden semantic structure;text body;typical topic modeling application;numerous techniques;Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;prevalent topic modeling method;Hierarchical LDA Model;Dynamic Topic Model;Correlated Topic Model;Pachinko Allocation Topic Model;Author Topic Model;topic discovery;digital age;increased data generation;NLP algorithms;smooth data processing;machine learning algorithms;supervised reinforcement learning;unsupervised, reinforcement learning","","","","17","IEEE","15 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An effective approach bi-term topic model(BTM) has been proposed which models the word co-occurrence at the whole corpus directly and performs better than conventional topic models. However, BTM only consider the frequency of bi-term simply and ignore the latent semantic information between bi-terms which cause the words with similar semantic having a great risk of being grouped under different topic.

Common methods of topic modeling usually produce a collection of unlabeled topics where each topic is depicted by a distribution of words. Associating semantic meaning with these word distributions is not always straightforward. Traditionally, this task is left to human interpretation. Manually labeling the topics is unfortunately not always easy, as topics generated by unsupervised learning methods do not necessarily align well with our prior knowledge in the subject domains. Currently, two approaches to solve this issue exist. The first is a post-processing procedure that assigns each topic with a label from the prior knowledge base that is semantically closest to the word distribution of the topic. The second is a supervised topic modeling approach that restricts the topics to a predefined set whose word distributions are provided beforehand. Neither approach is ideal, as the former may produce labels that do not accurately describe the word distributions, and the latter lacks the ability to detect unknown topics that are crucial to enrich our knowledge base. Our goal in this paper is to introduce a semisupervised Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model, Source-LDA, which incorporates prior knowledge to guide the topic modeling process to improve both the quality of the resulting topics and of the topic labeling. We accomplish this by integrating existing labeled knowledge sources representing known potential topics into a probabilistic topic model. These knowledge sources are translated into a distribution and used to set the hyperparameters of the Dirichlet generated distribution over words. This approach ensures that the topic inference process is consistent with existing knowledge, and simultaneously, allows for discovery of new topics. The results show improved topic generation and increased accuracy in topic labeling when compared to those obtained using various labeling approaches based off LDA.","2375-026X","978-1-5090-6543-1","10.1109/ICDE.2017.99","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7929995","","Mathematical model;Labeling;Sports equipment;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet","inference mechanisms;probability;word processing","probabilistic topic models;prior knowledge sources;semantic meaning;word distributions;supervised topic modeling;semisupervised Latent Dirichlet allocation model;Source-LDA model;labeled knowledge sources;probabilistic topic model;knowledge sources;hyperparameters;Dirichlet generated distribution;topic inference process;topic generation;topic labeling","","27","","42","","18 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in the sparse short-text context, many highly related words may never co-occur. BTM may lose many potential coherent and prominent word co-occurrence patterns that cannot be observed in the corpus. To address this problem, we propose a novel relational BTM (R-BTM) model, which links short texts using a similarity list of words computed employing word embeddings.

Topic modeling in Otis context allows for more nuanced categories of crime compared to official UCR categorizations. In this paper we suggest two metrics for the evaluation of crime topic models: coherence and spatial concentration. The importance of space comes into play through Weisburd's law of crime concentration, that states a large percentage of crime occurs in a small area of a city. We investigate the extent to which topic models that improve coherence lead to higher levels of crime concentration. Through analyzing a dataset of crime reports from Los Angeles, CA, we find that Latent Dirichlst Allocation (IDA) generates crime topics with both higher coherence and crime concentration. While NMF improves the coherence compared to UCR categorization, die spatial concentration is not as high. These foldings have important implications for hotspot policing.","","978-1-5386-7848-0","10.1109/ISI.2018.8587384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8587384","Crime topic modeling;LDA;NMF;Crime hotspot;Gini index","Coherence;Indexes;Urban areas;Windows;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","matrix decomposition;police data processing;text analysis","crime report text;official UCR categorizations;crime topic models;spatial concentration;crime reports;topic coherence;spatial crime concentration;nan-negative matrix factorization topic modeling;NAfP;Los Angeles CA;latent dirichlet allocation","","5","","14","","27 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In topic modeling, each document is represented as a collection of words. Labeling appropriate word distributions to the defined topic is a challenging task. Topic modeling using unsupervised algorithm does not align topics with those as it exists in the real world metaphor. This problem of aligning topic with real world objects can be carried out by two different methods-either to use a supervised learning algorithm that assigns individual topic with a label acquired from existing data or to use a predefined set of topics and to match them with the distribution of words. The above said methods have some drawbacks as the former method may match a label which does not convey a semantic meaning with the word distributions whereas the latter lacks the knowledge required to detect the topic from the closed set of topics. In this paper an algorithm called Concept-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Concept-LDA) is proposed which incorporates reinforcement learning for topic modeling which inturn improves the accuracy of resulting topics and of the topic labeling. Experiments were conducted using LDA and Concept-LDA for topic modeling and it is shown that Concept-LDA showing better accuracy than LDA.","","978-1-7281-0211-5","10.1109/COMITCon.2019.8862179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8862179","Documents;Reinforcement learning;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Gamma distribution;Topic modeling;etc.","Feature extraction;Clustering algorithms;Reinforcement learning;Computational modeling;Resource management;Text processing","natural language processing;pattern clustering;supervised learning;word processing","topic modeling;topic labeling;documents clustering;word distributions;supervised learning algorithm;concept-latent Dirichlet allocation;Concept-LDA;reinforcement learning","","1","","15","","11 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed methodology of topic modelling used artificial neural networks to improve the clustering mechanism of similar documents by modelling probabilistic relations between the topics, documents and vocabulary. Currently, while topic modelling and clustering are considered to be manifestations of unsupervised learning, and neural networks on the other hand are used for supervised learning problems, Neural Topic Modelling reformulated topic modelling into a supervised learning task by defining an objective function whose loss function had to be minimized. Custom input embedding layers were designed in order to extract the semantic relationships between the words in the corpus, and the output of the model presented a topic probability distribution for each document. The documents with similar distributions were then bucketed together based on the criteria of meeting the threshold value of a simple distance based similarity metric, such as cosine similarity. The model was implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend and the effectiveness of the clustering was validated on the IMDB Movie dataset and the News Aggregator dataset from UCI. On comparison with other commonly used clustering mechanisms in combination with traditional topic models, the proposed model delivered an improved Silhouette Co-efficient Score and Davies-Bouldin Index, along with an increased data handling capacity, thereby making the solution scalable.","","978-1-5386-9276-9","10.1109/SSCI.2018.8628912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8628912","Deep Learning;Artificial Neural Networks;Topic Modelling;Clustering;Neural Topic Modelling","Computational modeling;Data models;Neural networks;Computer architecture;Probabilistic logic;Task analysis;Linear programming","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern clustering;probability;statistical distributions;text analysis;unsupervised learning","text mining technique;artificial neural networks;clustering mechanism;modelling probabilistic relations;supervised learning problems;supervised learning task;topic probability distribution;document clustering;loss function;topic models;neural topic modelling reformulated topic","","1","","14","","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, despite several existing conventional techniques, they have had limited success when applied directly for filtering and quick comprehension of short-text contents due to text sparseness and noise. Thus, it always has been challenging to discover reliable latent topics from online discussion texts that prevail with low words co-occurrence and availability of large size social media benchmark datasets, even for resource-rich languages. The existing literature lacks such work for Urdu text to unveil niche topics even with conventional topic models, mainly due to the lack of benchmark datasets, limited availability of pre-processing tools/ algorithms, and time and compute limitations on large-sized datasets. This work presents experiments with multiple approaches of topic modeling like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on 0.8 million Urdu tweets. These tweets are collected through Twitter API by giving various hashtags as a query to avoid dominance of single topic in the dataset. In addition, we have pre-processed the text of the tweets, prepared the three variants of the collected dataset, and extracted multiple features to represent documents on different n-grams. Furthermore, all these techniques are compared and evaluated on the dataset variants, using both qualitative and quantitative measures. We have also demonstrated the results of these approaches through visualization methods, graphs depicting tweets size per topic, word clouds, and hashtags analysis, giving insights about algorithms performances on finalized topics. Observed results reveal that NMF outperformed the techniques with TF-IDF feature vectors in Urdu tweets text, while LDA performed best with merging short-text strategy into long pseudo documents.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3112620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9536731","Natural language processing;short-text topic model;topic evaluation;topic modeling;Urdu text processing","Social networking (online);Semantics;Labeling;Blogs;Analytical models;Solid modeling","application program interfaces;feature extraction;matrix decomposition;natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis","hashtags analysis;Urdu tweets text;short-text strategy;NMF topic models;automatic labeling;Social media Platforms;topic modeling methods;quick comprehension;short-text contents;text sparseness;reliable latent topics;online discussion texts;low words co-occurrence;large-size social media benchmark datasets;resource-rich languages;Urdu text;conventional topic models;large-sized datasets;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;latent Dirichlet allocation;nonnegative matrix factorization;Twitter API;collected dataset;visualization methods;tweets size;word clouds","","","","57","CCBY","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The presented Topic Model for Urdu is combined with preprocessing activities, hLDA model, and Gibbs Sampling (GS) algorithm. We present hLDA base topic model called Urdu Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (uhLDA). Empirical study showed that uhLDA effectively learns the topics hierarchies from 5000 Urdu text documents. Furthermore, we evaluated the results using Pointwise Mutual information (PMI) and it shows that uhLDA outperforms as compared to existing standard topic model LDA.","","978-1-8613-7665-7","10.23919/IConAC.2019.8895047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8895047","Hierarchal Topic model;Hierarchal LDA;Urdu Topic Model;Urdu Hierarchal LDA;Natural Language Processing;Gibbs sampling","","Bayes methods;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis","Urdu text documents;Urdu text articles;digital text;social media;Big Data;Urdu text data;Gibbs sampling algorithm;hLDA base topic model;Urdu Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation;hierarchical topic modeling;Internet;nonparametric Bayesian topic model","","2","","18","","11 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional long text topic modeling algorithms (e.g., PLSA and LDA) based on word co-occurrences cannot solve this problem very well since only very limited word co-occurrence information is available in short texts. Therefore, short text topic modeling has already attracted much attention from the machine learning research community in recent years, which aims at overcoming the problem of sparseness in short texts. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of various short text topic modeling techniques proposed in the literature. We present three categories of methods based on Dirichlet multinomial mixture, global word co-occurrences, and self-aggregation, with example of representative approaches in each category and analysis of their performance on various tasks. We develop the first comprehensive open-source library, called STTM, for use in Java that integrates all surveyed algorithms within a unified interface, benchmark datasets, to facilitate the expansion of new methods in this research field.

However, on the one hand, most topic models are aimed at long texts, and cannot show a good performance on short texts because of its semantic sparsity. On the other hand, traditional topic models ignore the time factor of documents. Nevertheless, hot issues on the Internet have an opinion life cycle, topics around an issue tend to emerge, develop and vanish rapidly in a short period of time. As a result, ignoring time factor is not consistent with reality. Besides, traditional topic models are likely to extract topics with unnecessarily repeated keywords because pronouns about the same issue have a high frequency in different posts. To solve these problems, we propose a topic model for short texts about hot issues on Microblog based on Dynamic Topic Model(DTM). By introducing Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF) to extract more characteristic words, TFIDF-DTM could reduce the input dimension for DTM and make the extracted topics more representative in the final. The model is tested on a self-crawled dataset, compared with standard DTM, The extraction process of TFIDF-DTM costs less time, and the result has a higher topic discrimination, as well as more explicit semantics.","","978-1-6654-9544-8","10.1109/ICNLP55136.2022.00092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9885860","Short Texts;DTM;TF-IDF;Topic Model","Training;Computational modeling;Semantics;Blogs;Parallel processing;Natural language processing;Internet","data mining;information retrieval;Internet;natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis;Web sites","time factor;traditional topic models;short texts;hot issues;Microblog;extracted topics;higher topic discrimination;long texts","","","","15","IEEE","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is widely used in topic discovery, information retrieval, and document modeling. In recent years, with the advancement of research about neural networks, topic models using neural networks, such as NVLDA and ProdLDA, have been presented. Since it is easy to use accelerators such as GPUs for training these, topic modeling for large corpora can be done efficiently. Topic models are also used for short texts such as social networking sites and product reviews, where the number of words in a document is often short. This means that the co-occurrence information of words is also extremely less, and it is difficult to infer latent topics for easy understanding by humans when training with only the target corpus. In this paper, we investigated whether trained word embedding vectors on other large corpora such as Wikipedia compensate for the lack of word information in short texts. While previous studies have been conducted on long texts such as newspaper articles, we specifically checked the effect on short texts. As a result, we confirmed that under many conditions, Topic Coherence evaluation using Wikipedia was improved by using word embedding. However, we were not able to achieve stable high performance in terms of topic diversity.

Traditional topic models like Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) behave not well on short texts due to data sparsity problem. One novel model called Biterm Topic Model (BTM) which models unordered word-pairs (i.e., biterms) from whole corpus was proposed to solve this problem. However, both the performance and efficiency of BTM are reduced because of many irrelevant and useless biterms. In this paper, we propose a Multiterm Topic Model (MTM) for short text topic modeling. MTM extracts variable-length and more correlative word patterns (i.e., multiterms) from the whole corpus. By directly modeling the generative process of multiterms, MTM can infer the word distributions of each topic and the topic distribution of each short text to alleviate the sparsity problem in short text modeling. With the the proper amount of flexible multiterms, learning process of MTM is enhanced. Through extensive experiments on two real-world short text collections, we show that MTM is more efficient and outperforms the baseline models in terms of topic coherence and text classification.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-1985-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8852366","Short Text;Topic Model;Text Classification;Multiterm","Computational modeling;Semantics;Companies;Data models;Google;Neural networks;Probabilistic logic","inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","MTM;short text topic modeling;correlative word patterns;topic distribution;short text modeling;real-world short text collections;topic coherence;text classification;flexible word patterns;effective semantic representations;discriminative topics;coherent latent topics;traditional topic models;models unordered word-pairs;biterm topic model;multiterm topic model;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;PLSA;LDA;latent dirichlet allocation","","1","","30","","30 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The topics discovered by these models consist of phrases besides individual words, as phrases are typically more meaningful. However, these models typically require large amounts of data to provide reliable statistics for phrase-based topic modeling, thus limiting their performance in scenarios with limited data. To address this limitation, we propose a knowledge-based topic model that incorporates two types of pre-identified external knowledge for topical phrase discovery: Phrase knowledge, and phrase correlation knowledge. Phrase knowledge guides the discovery of meaningful phrases by leveraging a set of pre-identified exemplary phrases; Phrase correlation knowledge guides the discovery of meaningful topics by exploiting a set of pre-identified pairs of related phrases.

The original LDA takes the Bag-of-Word representation as the input and produces topic distributions in documents as output. The drawback of Bag-of-Word is that it represents each word with a plain one-hot encoding which does not encode the word level information. Later research in Natural Language Processing(NLP) demonstrate that word embeddings technique such as Skipgram model can provide a good representation in capturing the relationship and semantic information between words. In recent studies, many NLP tasks could gain better performance by applying the word embedding as the representation of words. In this paper, we propose Deep Word-Topic Latent Dirichlet Allocation(DWT-LDA), a new process for training LDA with word embedding. A neural network with word embedding is applied to the Collapsed Gibbs Sampling process as another choice for word topic assignment. To quantitatively evaluate our model, the topic coherence framework and topic diversity are the metrics used to compare between our approach and the original LDA. The experimental result shows that our method generates more coherent and diverse topics.","2642-6579","978-1-6654-3831-5","10.1109/JCSSE53117.2021.9493816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9493816","Topic Modeling;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Word Embedding","Training;Measurement;Computer science;Computational modeling;Semantics;Neural networks;Natural languages","deep learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;text analysis","Topic modeling enhancement;Bag-of-Word representation;topic distributions;word level information;word embedding;Word-Topic Latent Dirichlet Allocation;word topic assignment;topic coherence framework;topic diversity;coherent topics;diverse topics","","1","","11","","27 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is an increasingly widespread problem: sifting through an organization’s e-mails, understanding a decade worth of newspapers, or characterizing a scientific field’s research. This monograph explores the ways that humans and computers make sense of document collections through tools called topic models. Topic models are a statistical framework that help users understand large document collections; not just to find individual documents but to understand the general themes present in the collection. Applications of Topic Models describes the recent academic and industrial applications of topic models. In addition to topic models’ effective application to traditional problems like information retrieval, visualization, statistical inference, multilingual modeling, and linguistic understanding, Applications of Topic Models also reviews topic models’ ability to unlock large text collections for qualitative analysis. It reviews their successful use by researchers to help understand fiction, non-fiction, scientific publications, and political texts. Applications of Topic Models is aimed at the reader with some knowledge of document processing, basic understanding of some probability, and interested in many application domains. It discusses the information needs of each application area, and how those specific needs affect models, curation procedures, and interpretations. By the end of the monograph, it is hoped that readers will be excited enough to attempt to embark on building their own topic models. It should also be of interest to topic model experts as the coverage of diverse applications may expose models and approaches they had not seen before.","","9781680833096","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8186621.pdf&bkn=8186620&pdfType=book","Design and Evaluation;Information visualization;Applications of IR;Information categorization and clustering;Natural processing for IR;Summarization;Clustering;Bayesian learning;Dimensionality reduction;Markov chain Monte Carlo","","","","","","","","","15 Dec 2017","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

However, directly applying conventional topic models (e.g. LDA and PLSA) on such short texts may not work well. Therefore, we use BTM (Biterm Topic Model) that is robust even in short texts to estimate topic distribution. Then, it constructs an adversarial neural network to extract topic-agnostic features effectively.

It would also result in a rich user experience. Although the discovery of finding similar users on Twitter is a well-studied problem, this work tries to achieve that result by building an interest matrix for each user from their tweets and thus including an important variable in finding similar users.

A probabilistic topic model extracts a set of hidden topics from a collection of text documents. It defines each topic by a probability distribution over words and describes each document with a probability distribution over topics. In applications, there are often many requirements, such as, for example, problem-specific knowledge and additional data, to be taken into account. Therefore, it is natural for topic modelling to be considered a multiobjective optimization problem. However, historically, Bayesian learning became the most popular approach for topic modelling. In the Bayesian paradigm, all requirements are formalized in terms of a probabilistic generative process. This approach is not always convenient due to some limitations and technical difficulties. In this work, we develop a non-Bayesian multiobjective approach called the Additive Regularization of Topic Models (ARTM). It is based on regularized Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and we show that many of the well-known Bayesian topic models can be re-formulated in a much simpler way using the regularization point of view. We review some of the most important types of topic models: multimodal, multilingual, temporal, hierarchical, graph-based, and short-text. The ARTM framework enables easy combination of different types of models to create new models with the desired properties for applications. This modular “lego-style” technology for topic modelling is implemented in the open-source library BigARTM.","","978-952-68653-2-4","10.23919/FRUCT.2017.8250181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8250181","","Bayes methods;Probabilistic logic;Optimization;Additives;Data models;Mathematical model;Probability distribution","Bayes methods;data mining;maximum likelihood estimation;statistical distributions;text analysis","Additive Regularization of Topic Models;short-text topic model;graph-based topic model;hierarchical topic model;temporal topic model;multilingual topic model;multimodal topic model;BigARTM library;Maximum Likelihood Estimation;non-Bayesian multiobjective approach;probability distribution;text documents;text mining;regularized topic modelling;Bayesian topic models;hidden topics;probabilistic topic model","","11","","74","","11 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

High spatial resolution images enable more accurate analysis and identification of land cover types. However, a higher spatial resolution also brings new challenges to the existing classification methods. In the low-level feature spaces of remote sensing images, it is difficult to improve classification performance by modifying classifiers. Probabilistic topic models can connect low-level features and high-level semantics of remote sensing images. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) models are representatives of probabilistic topic models. However, at present, probabilistic topic models are mainly adopted for scene classification and image retrieval in remote sensing image analysis only. In this study, multiscale segmentation was employed to construct bag-of-words (BoW) representations of high-resolution images. The segmented patches were then utilized as “image documents.” A structural topic model was used with an LDA model to import spatial information from the image documents at two levels: topical prevalence and topical content in the form of covariates.

While these applications were able to successfully identify the general topics, we posit that standard LDA can be augmented with spatial and temporal considerations based on the geo-coordinates and timestamps of social media posts. Towards this effort, we propose a spatial and temporal variant of LDA to better detect more specific topics, such as a particular art exhibit held at a museum or a security incident happening on a particular day.

In particular, hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA) builds a topic tree based on the nested Chinese Restaurant Process (nCRP) or other sampling processes to generate a topic hierarchy that allows arbitrarily large branch structures and adaptive dataset growth. In addition, hierarchical topic models based on the latent tree model, such as Hierarchical Latent Tree Analysis (HLTA), have been developed over the last five years. However, these models do not work well in cases with millions of documents and hundreds of thousands of terms. In addition, the topic trees generated by these models are always poorly interpretable, and the relationships among topics in different levels are relatively simple. The biomedical literature, including Medline abstracts, has large-scale documents in two major categories: biological laboratory research and medical clinical research. We propose a top-down binary hierarchical topic model (biHTM) for biomedical literature by iteratively applying a flat topic model and adaptively processing subtrees of the hierarchy. The biHTM topic hierarchy of complete Medline abstracts with more than 14 topic node levels shows good bimodality and interpretability. Compared to hLDA and HLTA, biHTM shows promising results in experiments assessed in terms of runtime and quality.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2983265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9046786","Topic model;topic hierarchy;binary modality;biomedical literature;text mining","Biological system modeling;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Resource management;Viruses (medical);Probabilistic logic","medical information systems;text analysis;trees (mathematics)","top-down binary hierarchical topic model;Medline abstracts;HLTA;hLDA;nCRP;nested Chinese restaurant process;biHTM topic hierarchy generation;topic node levels;medical clinical research;biological laboratory research;Hierarchical Latent Tree Analysis;latent tree model;adaptive dataset growth;arbitrarily large branch structures;sampling processes;topic tree;hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation;biomedical literature;flat topic model","","","","38","CCBY","25 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Users compare the proposed optimizations to the current model state and preview their effect on the next model iterations, before applying one of them.

Previous work has attempted to tackle this problem with vanilla topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). However, in those methods no prior knowledge for the given image collection is exploited to facilitate object discovery. On the other hand, the topic models used in those methods suffer from the topic coherence issue-some inferred topics do not have clear meaning, which limits the final performance of object discovery. In this paper, prior knowledge in terms of the so-called must-links are exploited from Web images on the Internet. Furthermore, a novel knowledge-based topic model, called LDA with mixture of Dirichlet trees, is proposed to incorporate the must-links into topic modeling for object discovery. In particular, to better deal with the polysemy phenomenon of visual words, the must-link is re-defined as that one must-link only constrains one or some topic(s) instead of all topics, which leads to significantly improved topic coherence. Moreover, the must-links are built and grouped with respect to specific object classes, thus the must-links in our approach are semantic-specific, which allows to more efficiently exploit discriminative prior knowledge from Web images. Extensive experiments validated the efficiency of our proposed approach on several data sets. It is shown that our method significantly improves topic coherence and outperforms the unsupervised methods for object discovery and localization. In addition, compared with discriminative methods, the naturally existing object classes in the given image collection can be subtly discovered, which makes our approach well suited for realistic applications of unsupervised object discovery.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2017.2718667","NSFC(grant numbers:61432014,U1605252,61402348,61672402); Key Industrial Innovation Chain in Industrial Domain(grant numbers:2016KTZDGY-02); National High-Level Talents Special Support Program of China(grant numbers:CS31117200001); NSFC(grant numbers:61629301); NSFC(grant numbers:61503296); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7955010","Object discovery;object localization;topic model;latent Dirichlet allocation","Visualization;Coherence;Image segmentation;Semantics;Resource management;Buildings;Computational modeling","image classification;image retrieval;Internet;object detection;trees (mathematics)","topic model;unsupervised object discovery;dominant object classes;object instances;vanilla topic models;topic coherence issue;inferred topics;must-links;Web images;topic modeling;specific object classes;discriminative prior knowledge;naturally existing object classes;image collection;knowledge-based topic model;latent Dirichlet allocation;LDA;visual words","","18","","40","IEEE","22 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Users' behaviors are typically high dimensional and hard to understand. Therefore, dimension reduction of users' behaviors from high dimensions and explainability are important to help MOs launch operation-friendly marketings. As such, it is natural to exploit topic models to help MOs understand users' intents from users' behaviors (e.g., user-item visits) in case we treat each user as a document and users' behaviors of visiting an item as a word. However, users of low activities and items followed by power law distributions are common in user-item visit data, which pose significant challenges to traditional topic models. We present a social and semantic enhanced topic model (S2TM) for users' intent mining. We optimize the user-intent estimates based on a graph neural network atop of a social network, and optimize the intent-item estimates based on a skip-gram word embedding approach by linking the semantics of items to pre-trained word embeddings. We propose an efficient stochastic vari-ational inference algorithm for the inference of latent variables and learning of parameters. Extensive experiments on real-world data show the effectivenesses of S2TM in terms of perplexities, topic coherence and semantic coherence compared with state-of-the-art topic models.

With this goal in mind, we propose two new fuzzy topic models; FLSA-W and FLSA-V. Both models are derived from the topic model Fuzzy Latent Semantic Analysis (FLSA). After training each model ten times, we use the mean coherence score to compare the different models with the benchmark models Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and FLSA. Our proposed models generally lead to higher coherence scores and lower standard deviations than the benchmark models.

Hence, the wisdom of the crowd (i.e., topic models previously trained based upon other corpora) is abandoned. Since a massive amount of in-domain data, considerable computational cost, and human labour are involved in obtaining a high-quality topic model, training from scratch for each new corpus is a huge waste of resources. In this paper, we propose the novel TopicOcean framework, which aims to integrate well-trained topic models and transfer the knowledge of accumulated topics to new corpora in order to improve the quality of their topic models. We first propose a method of constructing the ever-increasing TopicOcean, and then propose a meta-learning mechanism that transfers the meta-level knowledge (i.e., topics) in TopicOcean to the scenario of topic modeling on new corpora. Comprehensive experiments validate that the TopicOcean framework can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art (53.77% perplexity improvement on a temporal-shift corpus and 29.24% improvement on a domain-shift corpus).

Conventional topic models based on word co-occurrences infer the hidden semantic structure from a corpus of documents. However, due to the limited length of short text, data sparsity impedes the inference process of conventional topic models and causes unsatisfactory results on short texts. In fact, each short text usually contains a limited number of topics, and understanding semantic content of short text needs to the relevant background knowledge. Inspired by the observed information, we propose a regularized non-negative matrix factorization topic model for short texts, named TRNMF. The proposed model leverages pre-trained distributional vector representation of words to overcome the data sparsity problem of short texts. Meanwhile, the method employs the clustering mechanism under document-to-topic distributions during the topic inference by using Gibbs Sampling Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture model. TRNMF integrates successfully both word co-occurrence regularization and sentence similarity regularization into topic modeling for short texts. Through extensive experiments on constructed real-world short text corpus, experimental results show that TRNMF can achieve better results than the state-of-the-art methods in term of topic coherence measure and text classification task.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973207","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702508,61802404); National Social Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:19BSH022); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2019QY1303); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8993771","Topic model;short texts;word embedding;document correlation;non-negative matrix factorization;regularization","Semantics;Data models;Solid modeling;Knowledge based systems;Computational modeling;Correlation;Task analysis","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;matrix decomposition;mixture models;Monte Carlo methods;pattern classification;pattern clustering;text analysis","short text;conventional topic models;nonnegative matrix factorization topic model;topic coherence measure;text classification task;word embedding;document correlation;text mining domains;semantic content;data sparsity problem;regularized nonnegative matrix factorization topic model;pre-trained distributional vector representation;TRNMF;clustering mechanism;document-to-topic distributions;Gibbs sampling Dirichlet multinomial mixture model;word co-occurrence regularization;sentence similarity regularization;real-world short text corpus","","12","","45","CCBY","11 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mobile app developers check their users' reviews frequently to clarify the issues experienced by users or capture the new issues that are introduced due to a recent app update. App reviews have a dynamic nature and their discussed topics change over time. The changes in the topics among collected reviews for different versions of an app can reveal important issues about the app update. A main technique in this analysis is using topic modeling algorithms. However, app reviews are short texts and it is challenging to unveil their latent topics over time. Conventional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) suffer from the sparsity of word co-occurrence patterns while inferring topics for short texts. Furthermore, these algorithms cannot capture topics over numerous consecutive time-slices (or versions). Online topic modeling algorithms such as Online LDA (OLDA) and Online Biterm Topic Model (OBTM) speed up the inference of topic models for the texts collected in the latest time-slice by saving a fraction of data from the previous time-slice. But these algorithms do not analyze the statistical-data of all the previous time-slices, which can confer contributions to the topic distribution of the current time-slice.In this paper, we propose Adaptive Online Biterm Topic Model (AOBTM) to model topics in short texts adaptively. AOBTM alleviates the sparsity problem in short-texts and considers the statistical-data for an optimal number of previous time-slices. We also propose parallel algorithms to automatically determine the optimal number of topics and the best number of previous versions that should be considered in topic inference phase. Automatic evaluation on collections of app reviews and real-world short text datasets confirm that AOBTM can find more coherent topics and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. For reproducibility of the results, we open source all scripts.","2576-3148","978-1-7281-5619-4","10.1109/ICSME46990.2020.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9240699","App review analysis;adaptive topic model;biterm;online algorithm;automatic parameter setting","Analytical models;Adaptation models;Software maintenance;Software algorithms;Inference algorithms;Data models;Mobile applications","data analysis;mobile computing;parallel algorithms;probability;statistical analysis;text analysis","AOBTM;mobile app developers;latent topics;conventional topic models;Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis;Online topic modeling algorithms;topic distribution;topic inference phase;real-world short text datasets;coherent topics;adaptive online biterm topic modeling;mobile app reviews analysis;consecutive time-slices;latent Dirichlet allocation;online LDA;statistical-data analysis;sparsity problem;parallel algorithms;version sensitive short-text analysis","","1","","51","","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The availability of fast-moving sources in the form of short texts, such as social media and blogs, allows aggregation from a vast number of text sources, for an up to date view of trends and business insights. Topic modeling is established as an approach for analysis of large amounts of texts, but the scarcity of statistical information in short texts is considered to be a major problem for obtaining reliable topics from traditional models such as LDA. A range of different specialized topic models have been proposed, but a majority of these approaches rely on rather strong parametric assumptions, such as setting a fixed number of topics. In contrast, recent advances in the field of Bayesian non-parametrics suggest the Dirichlet process as a method that, given certain hyper-parameters, can self-adapt to the number of topics of the data at hand. We perform an empirical evaluation of the Dirichlet process multinomial (unigram) mixture model against several parametric topic models, initialized with different number of topics. The resulting models are evaluated, using both direct and indirect measures that have been found to correlate well with human topic rankings. We show that the Dirichlet Process Multinomial Mixture model is a viable option for short text topic modeling since it on average performs better, or nearly as good, compared to the parametric alternatives, while reducing parameter setting requirements and thereby eliminates the need of expensive preprocessing.","","978-1-5386-9450-3","10.1109/ISCBI.2018.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8638311","text-analysis;topic-modeling;Bayesian-nonparametrics;Dirichlet-process;short-text","Mixture models;Bayes methods;Data models;Training;Informatics;Market research;Analytical models","Bayes methods;commerce;mixture models;social networking (online);text analysis","parametric topic models;human topic rankings;short-text topic modeling;highly competitive business areas;automatic analysis;short texts;social media;blogs;text sources;Dirichlet process multinomial mixture model;statistical information","","2","","15","","10 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a novel topic modeling technique for NGS data analysis using Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). The proposed method has four tasks: NGS dataset construction, preprocessing of data, topic modeling, and text mining using PLSA topic outputs. The NGS data of Salmonella enterica strains were used as the dataset in this procedure. The topic modeling performance is measured using standard clustering comparison measures such as Adjusted Rand Index, Normalized Mutual Information, Normalized Information Distance, and Normalized Variation of Information. The performance of PLSA topic modeling on NGS data was compared with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF) algorithm and existing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. The Evaluations have shown that PLSA outperforms compare with NNMF and LDA topic models.","","978-1-5386-7989-0","10.1109/ICACCP.2019.8882949","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882949","Topic modeling;NGS data;text mining;clustering;genetic diversity","Strain;Mathematical model;Data models;Analytical models;Probabilistic logic;Integrated circuits;Data mining","data analysis;data mining;matrix decomposition;microorganisms;pattern clustering;probability;text analysis","next-generation sequence data analysis;PLSA topic modeling technique;mainstream researchers;biological research problems;medical research problems;NGS technologies;data processing;data mining;text mining;NGS data analysis;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;NGS dataset construction;topic modeling performance;normalized mutual information;normalized information distance;clustering comparison measures;latent Dirichlet allocation;LDA topic models;nonnegative matrix factorization;NNMF algorithm","","","","26","","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These tasks are supported by an interactive visual analytics workspace that uses word-embedding projections to define concept regions which can then be refined. The user-refined concepts are independent of a particular document collection and can be transferred to related corpora. All user interactions within the concept space directly affect the semantic relations of the underlying vector space model, which, in turn, change the topic modeling. In addition to direct manipulation, our system guides the users' decisionmaking process through recommended interactions that point out potential improvements.

First, a total of seven topics were extracted from the Amazon's review data through Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and the topics were mapped, through group discussion, to three smartness elements defined from the literature review. Then, sentiment scores of each topic were calculated using SentiWordNet, which were then used as variables to develop star rating classifiers.

The topic modeling is one of the emerging techniques in text mining; it is based on the discovery of latent data and the search for relationships among text documents. In this paper, the objective of the research is to evaluate a generic methodology based on topic modeling and text network modeling, that allows researchers to gather valuable information from surveys that use open-ended questions. To achieve this, this methodology has been evaluated through the use of a case study in which the responses to a teacher self-assessment survey in an Ecuadorian university have been studied. The main contribution of the article is the inclusion of clustering algorithms in order to complement the results obtained when executing topic modeling. The proposed methodology is based on four phases: (a) Construction of a text database, (b) Text mining and topic modeling, (c) Topic network modeling and (d) The relevance of the identified topics. In previous works, it has been observed that the human interpretative contribution plays an important role in the process, especially in phases (a) and (d). For this reason, the visualization interfaces, such as graphs and dendograms, are of critical importance for researchers in order allow topic to efficiently analyze the results of the topic modeling. As a result of this case study, a compendium of the main strategies that teachers carry out in their classes with the aim of improving student retention is presented.

Due to the length limitation, conventional topic models based on document-level word co-occurrence information often fail to distill semantically coherent topics from short text collections. On the other hand, word embeddings as a powerful tool have been successfully applied in natural language processing. Word embeddings trained on large corpus are encoded with general semantic and syntactic information of words, and hence they can be leveraged to guide topic modeling for short text collections as supplementary information for sparse co-occurrence patterns. However, word embeddings are trained on large external corpus and the encoded information is not necessarily suitable for training data set of topic models, which is ignored by most existing models. In this article, we propose a novel global and local word embedding-based topic model (GLTM) for short texts. In the GLTM, we train global word embeddings from large external corpus and employ the continuous skip-gram model with negative sampling (SGNS) to obtain local word embeddings. Utilizing both the global and local word embeddings, the GLTM can distill semantic relatedness information between words which can be further leveraged by Gibbs sampler in the inference process to strengthen semantic coherence of topics. Compared with five state-of-the-art short text topic models on four real-world short text collections, the proposed GLTM exhibits the superiority in most cases.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2863260","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61632019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425711","Text mining;context modeling;natural language processing;topic model;short text","Semantics;Training;Coherence;Context modeling;Syntactics;Natural language processing;Data models","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;text analysis","real-world short text collections;GLTM;topical information;document-level word co-occurrence information;semantically coherent topics;general semantic information;syntactic information;supplementary information;external corpus;encoded information;global word embedding-based topic model;local word embedding-based topic model;continuous skip-gram model;semantic relatedness information","","16","","31","OAPA","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Check-in data captures the spatial and temporal information of user movements and interests. To model and analyze the spatio-temporal aspect of check-in data and discover temporal topics and regions, we first propose a spatio-temporal topic model, i.e., Upstream Spatio-Temporal Topic Model (USTTM). USTTM can discover temporal topics and regions, i.e., a user's choice of region and topic is affected by time in this model. We use continuous time to model check-in data, rather than discretized time, avoiding the loss of information through discretization. In addition, USTTM captures the property that user's interests and activity space will change overtime, and users have different region and topic distributions at different times in USTTM. However, both USTTM and other related models capture “microscopic patterns” within a single city, where users share POIs, and cannot discover “macroscopic” patterns in a global area, where users check-in to different POIs. Therefore, we also propose a macroscopic spatio-temporal topic model, MSTTM, employing words of tweets that are shared between cities to learn the topics of user interests. We perform an experimental evaluation on Twitter and Gowalla data sets from New York City and on a Twitter US data set. In our qualitative analysis, we perform experiments with USTTM to discover temporal topics, e.g., how topic “tourist destinations” changes over time, and to demonstrate that MSTTM indeed discovers macroscopic, generic topics. In our quantitative analysis, we evaluate the effectiveness of USTTM in terms of perplexity, accuracy of POI recommendation, and accuracy of user and time prediction. Our results show that the proposed USTTM achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models, confirming that it is more natural to model time as an upstream variable affecting the other variables.

In recent years, as topic models like LDA can perform extraction and clustering in one step, most unsupervised and semi-supervised statistical models are LDA-based. These models often treat each short sentence from the review as the training unit. However, LDA is proposed for normal documents without considering the sparse word frequency of short texts, which makes LDA perform poorly on short texts. Instead of using LDA, this paper proposes a Seeded Biterm Topic Model (Seeded-BTM) that models the co-occurred word pairs (i.e., biterms) rather than sentences or whole reviews. And by using seed sets, the model enables unsupervised BTM to discover aspect topics that under the user guidance.

The LDA is also a popular choice to model other datasets spanning a discrete domain, such as population genetics and social networks. However, in order to model data spanning a continuous domain with the LDA, discrete approximations of the data need to be made. These discrete approximations to continuous data can lead to loss of information and may not represent the true structure of the underlying data. We present an augmented version of the LDA topic model, where topics are represented using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), which are multi-modal distributions spanning a continuous domain. This augmentation of the LDA topic model with Gaussian mixture topics is denoted by the GMM-LDA model. We use Gibbs sampling to infer model parameters. We demonstrate the utility of the GMM-LDA model by applying it to the problem of clustering sleep states in electroencephalography (EEG) data.

Each report cites tens of thousands of research papers, which comprise a correlated dataset of temporally grounded documents. We use a custom dynamic topic modeling algorithm to generate topics for both datasets and apply cross-domain analytics to identify the correlations between the IPCC chapters and their cited documents. The approach reveals both the influence of the cited research on the reports and how previous research citations have evolved over time. For the IPCC use case, the report topic model used 410 documents and a vocabulary of 5911 terms while the citations topic model was based on 200K research papers and a vocabulary more than 25K terms.

However, this has limitations when the algorithms cannot be easily adapted to changes, and it is difficult to realize interactivity closely supported by underlying algorithms. Instead, we emphasize the concept of tight integration, which advocates for the need to co-develop interactive algorithms and interactive visual analytic systems in parallel to allow flexibility and scalability. In this article, we describe design goals for efficiently and effectively executing the concept of tight integration among computation, visualization, and interaction for hierarchical topic modeling of text data.

Due to the fact that the forwarding mechanisms are essentially unclear, this paper focuses on the formation and evolution of the external as well as internal driving mechanisms and develops a Gaussian dynamic topic model for forwarding prediction by incorporating all the information of nodes and edges. First, based on the diversity of communities each user located in, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) traditional text modeling method is applied to user following relationships modeling that leads to the initial formation of communities, and user interacting relationships modeling that leads to the evolution of communities. Taking the advantage of LDA topic model in dealing with the problem of polysemy and synonym, we can mine user latent distribution over communities and analyze the external community driving effects. Second, considering the differences in individual habits, time factor is introduced and the dynamic topic model is proposed to model user behavioral attributes. Meanwhile, in regard to continuous user attributes modeling, the parameter of topic-word distribution in the topic model is replaced by multivariate Gaussian distributions, which shown to be effective at capturing the regularities of individual behavioral habits and analyzing the internal individual driving effects. Finally, combining with external and internal factors, a probabilistic graph model is used to modeling forwarding behavior. We propose methods based on Gibbs sampling and an expectation–maximization algorithm to estimate model parameters and fit our model to predict user forwarding actions. Experimental results indicate that the model can not only detect the latent communities but also can improve the performance of forwarding prediction effectively.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2019.2900299","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC0831500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772098); Chongqing Science and Technology Commission(grant numbers:cstc2017jcyjAX0099); Chongqing Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:cstc2017zdcy-zdyfx0002,cstc2017zdcy-zdyfx0092); Chongqing Graduate Education Teaching Reform Project(grant numbers:yjg183081); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8667906","Behavioral habits;communities;forwarding prediction;Gaussian dynamic topic model (GDTM);information propagation","Predictive models;Analytical models;Probabilistic logic;Time factors;Gaussian distribution;Twitter","expectation-maximisation algorithm;Gaussian distribution;graph theory;information retrieval;probability;social networking (online);text analysis","forwarding prediction;social networks;user behavioral attributes;latent communities;user forwarding actions;forwarding behavior;probabilistic graph model;multivariate Gaussian distributions;topic-word distribution;external community driving effects;user latent distribution;LDA topic model;user interacting relationships;user following relationships;latent Dirichlet allocation traditional text modeling method;Gaussian dynamic topic model","","2","","56","IEEE","15 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the large amount of tweets, a key challenge is to automatically model and determine the discussion topics without having prior knowledge of the types and number of topics, or requiring the technical expertise to define various algorithmic parameters. For this purpose, we propose the Clustering-based Topic Modelling (ClusTop) algorithm that constructs various types of word network and automatically determines the discussion topics using community detection approaches. Unlike traditional topic models, ClusTop is able to automatically determine the appropriate number of topics and does not require numerous parameters to be set. The ClusTop algorithm is also able to capture the syntactic meaning in tweets via the use of bigrams, trigrams and other word combinations in constructing the word network graph. Using three Twitter datasets with labelled crises and events as topics, ClusTop has been shown to outperform various baselines in terms of topic coherence, pointwise mutual information, precision, recall and F-score.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8258147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8258147","Topic Modelling;Clustering;Twitter;Microblogs","Twitter;Tagging;Clustering algorithms;Detection algorithms;Image edge detection;Market research;Syntactics","graph theory;pattern clustering;social networking (online);text analysis","traditional topic models;ClusTop algorithm;tweets;word combinations;word network graph;Twitter datasets;topic coherence;topic modelling algorithm;popular microblogging service;popular topics;niche topics;discussion topics;algorithmic parameters;clustering-based topic modelling algorithm;bigrams;trigrams;F-score","","12","","43","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The tweets contain the demonetization hashtag to help us understand sentiments of people about demonetization. This technique can be used by analysts across any industry to understand the pertinent topics revolving around any social issue to take further actions in their organizations. Leveraging this sort of statistical topic modelling can be quite useful to researchers to correctly identify primary components of huge textual corpora for any kind of further analysis.

There are many limitations directly applying common topic models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to short texts. In result of that, many short text topic models were put forward. The Word Network Topic Model (WNTM) is the typical one among them, which transfers sparse document to word space into dense word to word space and then learn topics from it. However, WNTM has its own limitation. The word co-occurrence matrix of the original document is used to construct the word network. This method is simple and intuitive, which can't express the deep meaning between words and words. To solve this problem, we proposed W2V-WNTM, which uses Word2Vec model instead of word co-occurrence to construct word network.

A recent proposal for measuring topical diversity identifies three distributions for assessing the diversity of documents: distributions of words within documents, words within topics, and topics within documents. Topic models play a central role in this approach and, hence, their quality is crucial to the efficacy of measuring topical diversity. The quality of topic models is affected by two causes: generality and impurity of topics. General topics only include common information of a background corpus and are assigned to most of the documents. Impure topics contain words that are not related to the topic. Impurity lowers the interpretability of topic models. Impure topics are likely to get assigned to documents erroneously. We propose a hierarchical re-estimation process aimed at removing generality and impurity. Our approach has three re-estimation components: (1) document re-estimation, which removes general words from the documents; (2) topic re-estimation, which re-estimates the distribution over words of each topic; and (3) topic assignment re-estimation, which re-estimates for each document its distributions over topics. For measuring topical diversity of text documents, our HiTR approach improves over the state-of-the-art measured on PubMed dataset.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2018.2874246","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research(grant numbers:NWO CI # 314.99.108); DiLiPaD; NWO(grant numbers:# 600.006.014); Nederlab(grant numbers:340-6148-t1-6); European Community's Seventh Framework Program(grant numbers:FP7/2007-2013); ENVRI(grant numbers:283465); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8482296","Text diversity;topic models;topic model re-estimation","Impurities;Task analysis;Sociology;Statistics;Mathematical model;Feature extraction;Data models","text analysis","hierarchical topic model re-estimation;text documents;topical diversity measuring;documents diversity;interpretability;document re-estimation;HiTR;PubMed dataset","","2","","33","IEEE","5 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such an approach is benefited by deep representation, easy interpretation, flexible learning and stochastic modeling. This study develops the unsupervised and supervised learning of deep unfolded topic models for document representation and classification. Conventionally, the unsupervised and supervised topic models are inferred via the variational inference algorithm where the model parameters are estimated by maximizing the lower bound of logarithm of marginal likelihood using input documents without and with class labels, respectively. The representation capability or classification accuracy is constrained by the variational lower bound and the tied model parameters across inference procedure. This paper aims to relax these constraints by directly maximizing the end performance criterion and continuously untying the parameters in learning process via deep unfolding inference (DUI). The inference procedure is treated as the layer-wise learning in a deep neural network. The end performance is iteratively improved by using the estimated topic parameters according to the exponentiated updates. Deep learning of topic models is therefore implemented through a back-propagation procedure. Experimental results show the merits of DUI with increasing number of layers compared with variational inference in unsupervised as well as supervised topic models.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2677439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7869412","Deep unfolding;topic model;variational inference;deep neural network;unsupervised/supervised learning","Probabilistic logic;Inference algorithms;Stochastic processes;Graphical models;Biological neural networks;Feature extraction","belief networks;document handling;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","layer-wise learning;deep neural network;estimated topic parameters;deep learning;probabilistic generative models;deterministic neural networks;deep representation;easy interpretation;flexible learning;stochastic modeling;unsupervised learning;deep unfolded topic models;document representation;unsupervised topic models;variational inference algorithm;deep unfolding inference;DUI","","28","","39","IEEE","2 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Users can communicate directly to the chatbot via a short message, after which the chatbot system spontaneously identifies the intent of the message and responds with relevant actions. Unfortunately, the scope of the chatbot knowledge is limited in handling messages by an increasingly varied group of users. The main consequence of such variation is a change in the composition of the intent labels. This paper focuses on topic modeling in dealing with two tasks: first, to find new intents from user messages that are not yet included in any previous intents; and second, to reorganize existing intents by analyzing the topic model generated. In the analysis, two possible changes in intent compositions are intent merging and splitting. The topic modeling approaches used in this research are LDA as a baseline, as well as state-of-the-art Top2Vec and BERTopic.

As patient's data comprises of a huge amount of text documents in a non-standardized format. In order to obtain the relevant data, the text documents pose a lot of challenging issues for data processing. Topic modeling is one of the popular techniques for information retrieval based on themes from the biomedical documents. In topic modeling discovering the precise topics from the biomedical documents is a challenging task. Furthermore, in biomedical text documents, the redundancy puts a negative impact on the quality of text mining as well. Therefore, the rapid growth of unstructured documents entails machine learning techniques for topic modeling capable of discovering precise topics. In this paper, we proposed a topic modeling technique for text mining through hybrid inverse document frequency and machine learning fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm. The proposed technique ameliorates the redundancy issue and discovers precise topics from the biomedical text documents. The proposed technique generates local and global term frequencies through the bag-of-words (BOW) model. The global term weighting is calculated through the proposed hybrid inverse documents frequency and Local term weighting is computed with term frequency. The robust principal component analysis is used to remove the negative impact of higher dimensionality on the global term weights. Afterward, the classification and clustering for text mining are performed with a probability of topics in the documents. The classification is performed through discriminant analysis classifier whereas the clustering is done through the k-means clustering. The performance of clustering is evaluated with Calinsiki-Har-abasz (CH) index internal validation method. The proposed toping modeling technique is evaluated on six standard datasets namely Ohsumed, MuchMore Springer Corpus, GENIA corpus, Bioxtext, tweets and WSJ redundant corpus for experimentation. The proposed topic modeling technique exhibits high performance on classification and clustering in text mining compared to baseline topic models like FLSA, LDA, and LSA. Moreover, the execution time of the proposed topic modeling technique remains stable for different numbers of topics.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2944973","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:22A20130012814); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854068","Topic modeling;biomedical;text mining;bag-of-words;classification;clustering;LDA;LSA","Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Text mining;Probabilistic logic;Task analysis;Redundancy;Biomedical imaging","data mining;document handling;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;natural language processing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;principal component analysis;query processing;text analysis","topic modeling technique;text mining;biomedical text corpora;hybrid inverse documents frequency;text data;biomedical text documents;unstructured documents;hybrid inverse document frequency;local term frequencies;global term frequencies;bag-of-words model;global term weighting;baseline topic models;machine learning fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm;information retrieval;robust principal component analysis;Calinsiki-Har-abasz index internal validation method;Ohsumed;MuchMore Springer Corpus;GENIA corpus;Bioxtext","","14","","56","CCBY","1 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Involving computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), it has become one of the most sophisticated research issues in the artificial-intelligence area. Based on the deep neural network, the neural image caption (NIC) model has achieved remarkable performance in image captioning, yet there still remain some essential challenges, such as the deviation between descriptive sentences generated by the model and the intrinsic content expressed by the image, the low accuracy of the image scene description, and the monotony of generated sentences. In addition, most of the current datasets and methods for image captioning are in English. However, considering the distinction between Chinese and English in syntax and semantics, it is necessary to develop specialized Chinese image caption generation methods to accommodate the difference. To solve the aforementioned problems, we design the NICVATP2L model via visual attention and topic modeling, in which the visual attention mechanism reduces the deviation and the topic model improves the accuracy and diversity of generated sentences. Specifically, in the encoding phase, convolutional neural network (CNN) and topic model are used to extract visual and topic features of the input images, respectively. In the decoding phase, an attention mechanism is applied to processing image visual features for obtaining image visual region features. Finally, the topic features and the visual region features are combined to guide the two-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) network for generating Chinese image captions. To justify our model, we have conducted experiments over the Chinese AIC-ICC image dataset. The experimental results show that our model can automatically generate more informative and descriptive captions in Chinese in a more natural way, and it outperforms the existing image captioning NIC model.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2020.2997034","Major Projects of National Social Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11&ZD189); Innocation Teams in Colleges and Universities in Jinan(grant numbers:2018GXRC014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9122435","Chinese image caption;deep neural network;topic modeling;visual attention","Visualization;Decoding;Semantics;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Natural language processing","computer vision;feature extraction;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;natural languages;neural nets;text analysis","topic modeling;automatic image captioning;image visual content;natural language text;natural language processing;deep neural network;neural image caption model;descriptive sentences;image scene description;generated sentences;specialized Chinese image caption generation methods;visual attention mechanism;topic model;convolutional neural network;topic features;input images;image visual features;image visual region features;Chinese image captions;Chinese AIC-ICC image dataset;informative captions;descriptive captions;existing image;NIC model","China;Language;Natural Language Processing;Neural Networks, Computer;Semantics","2","","56","IEEE","22 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing inference methods are based on variational approximation or Monte Carlo sampling, which often suffers from the local minimum defect. Spectral methods have been applied to learn unsupervised topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), with provable guarantees. This paper investigates the possibility of applying spectral methods to recover the parameters of supervised LDA (sLDA). We first present a two-stage spectral method, which recovers the parameters of LDA followed by a power update method to recover the regression model parameters. Then, we further present a single-phase spectral algorithm to jointly recover the topic distribution matrix as well as the regression weights. Our spectral algorithms are provably correct and computationally efficient. We prove a sample complexity bound for each algorithm and subsequently derive a sufficient condition for the identifiability of sLDA. Thorough experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets verify the theory and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the spectral algorithms. In fact, our results on a large-scale review rating dataset demonstrate that our single-phase spectral algorithm alone gets comparable or even better performance than state-of-the-art methods, while previous work on spectral methods has rarely reported such promising performance.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2682085","National 973 Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2013CB329403); National NSF of China(grant numbers:61620106010,61322308,61332007); NSFC; German Research Foundation (DFG)(grant numbers:NSFC 61621136008,DFC TRR-169); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7879308","Spectral methods;supervised topic models;methods of moments","Tensile stress;Computational modeling;Complexity theory;Analytical models;Maximum likelihood estimation;Algorithm design and analysis;Robustness","document handling;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis","spectral learning;supervised topic models;latent topic structure;inference methods;Monte Carlo sampling;unsupervised topic models;latent Dirichlet allocation;supervised LDA;two-stage spectral method;power update method;regression model parameters;single-phase spectral algorithm;topic distribution matrix;spectral algorithms;sufficient condition","","4","","34","IEEE","15 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent advances in Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) have enabled the development of black-box inference methods for topic modeling in order to alleviate the drawbacks of classical statistical inference. Most existing VAE based approaches assume a unimodal Gaussian distribution for the approximate posterior of latent variables, which limits the flexibility in encoding the latent space. In addition, the unsupervised architecture hinders the incorporation of extra label information, which is ubiquitous in many applications. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised topic model under the VAE framework. We assume that a document is modeled as a mixture of classes, and a class is modeled as a mixture of latent topics. A multimodal Gaussian mixture model is adopted for latent space. The parameters of the components and the mixing weights are encoded separately. These weights, together with partially labeled data, also contribute to the training of a classifier. The objective is derived under the Gaussian mixture assumption and the semi-supervised VAE framework. Modules of the proposed framework are appropriately designated.

This paper presents a hierarchical topic models with incorporated domain knowledge, called Guided Hierarchical Topic Model (GHTM). Specifically, we allocated the prior information from the knowledge to the Dirichlet Forest prior. From the prior adjustment, we obtained the topic tree guided by the domain knowledge. This paper also contributes in enumerating four different knowledge extraction methods and applying the extracted knowledge to GHTM. We evaluated the performance of GHTM in terms of the hierarchical clustering accuracy, and we found a significant improvement of hierarchical clustering measured by F-measures. This improvement is also verified by the perplexity analyses. Additionally, we measured topic quality with KL-divergence and visualization, and these confirm the ability to better separate topic distributions.

In this work, we introduce a topic modeling method of natural language processing into shilling attack detection and propose a shilling group detection method on the basis of hierarchical topic model. First, we model the given dataset to a series of user rating documents and use the hierarchical topic model to learn the specific topic distributions of each user from these rating documents to describe user rating behaviors. Second, we divide candidate groups based on rating value and rating time which are not involved in the hierarchical topic model. Lastly, we calculate group suspicious degrees in accordance with several indicators calculated through the analysis of user rating distributions, and use the k-means clustering algorithm to distinguish shilling groups.

In many applications, vertices of social networks contain textual information, e.g., citation networks, which form a text corpus and can be applied to the typical representation learning methods. The global context in the text corpus can be utilized by topic models to discover the topic structures of vertices. Nevertheless, most existing NRL approaches focus on learning representations from the local neighbors of vertices and ignore the global structure of the associated textual information in networks. In this article, we propose a unified model based on matrix factorization (MF), named collaborative representation learning (CRL), which: 1) considers complementary global and local information simultaneously and 2) models topics and learns network embeddings collaboratively. Moreover, we incorporate the Fletcher–Reeves (FR) MF, a conjugate gradient method, to optimize the embedding matrices in an alternative mode. We call this parameter learning method as AFR in our work that can achieve convergence after a few numbers of iterations. Also, by evaluating CRL on topic coherence and vertex classification using several real-world data sets, our experimental study shows that this collaborative model not only can improve the performance of topic discovery over the baseline topic models but also can learn better network representations than the state-of-the-art context-aware NRL models.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3054422","National Key Development and Research (D&R) Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1600704); The Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR(grant numbers:FDCT/0045/2019/A1,FDCT/0007/2018/A1); Guangzhou Science and Technology Innovation and Development Commission(grant numbers:EF005/FST-GZG/2019/GSTIC); University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2018-00129-FST); Guangdong Science and Technology Department(grant numbers:2019B111106001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9352557","Collaborative representation learning (CRL);global and local contexts;network embeddings;network representation learning (NRL);topic modeling","Context modeling;Collaboration;Learning systems;Electronic mail;Correlation;Data models;Network topology","conjugate gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;natural language processing;network theory (graphs);optimisation;pattern classification;social networking (online);text analysis","collaborative model;baseline topic models;CRL;network embeddings;network representation learning;vertex classification;link prediction;community detection;social networks;citation networks;text corpus;local neighbors;collaborative representation learning;complementary global information;local information;Fletcher-Reeves MF;conjugate gradient method;embedding matrices;parameter learning method;topic coherence;topic modeling;NRL approaches;matrix factorization;context-aware NRL models;textual information","","","","48","IEEE","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The cross-lingual word space mapping allows us to compare words of different languages, and LDA enables us to group words into topics. Both TC-LDA and PM-LDA do not need parallel or comparable corpus and hence have more applicable domains. The effectiveness of both methods is evaluated using UM-Corpus and WS-353. Our evaluation results indicate that both methods are able to identify similar documents written in different language.

We summarize three fundamental characteristics of the short text multimodal social media. The first is that the text of a short social media document generally belong to only one topic. The second is that the attached images can be relevant to multiple topics due to the rich information expressed in the images. The last is that although in most cases, text and images in social media posts are relevant, it should be noted that in a small number of cases, text and pictures are not relevant. However, most of the current multimodal topic models fail to model the these characteristics, and thus may produce low-quality topics. Based on these characteristics, we propose an unsupervised multimodal topic model SMMTM to model the short text multimodal social media documents. In the SMMTM model, only one topic is sampled for the the text while an image can belong to different topics. The correlation of the topics between the text and the images in a document are also formulated in an appropriate way.

"Unsupervised Topic Model Based Text Network Construction for Learning Word Embeddings","S. S. Chung; M.

One recently proposed semi-supervised representation learning method called Predictive Text Embedding (PTE) utilizes both semantically labeled and unlabeled data in information networks to learn the embedding of text that produces state of-the-art performance when compared to other embedding methods. However, PTE uses supervised label information to construct one of the networks and many other possible ways of constructing such information networks are left untested. We present two unsupervised methods that can be used in constructing a large scale semantic information network from documents by combining topic models that have emerged as a powerful technique of finding useful structure in an unstructured text collection as it learns distributions over words. The first method uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to build a topic model over text, and constructs a word topic network with edge weights proportional to the word-topic probability distributions. The second method trains an unsupervised neural network to learn the word-document distribution, with a single hidden layer representing a topic distribution. The two weight matrices of the neural net are directly reinterpreted as the edge weights of heterogeneous text networks that can be used to train word embeddings to build an effective low dimensional representation that preserves the semantic closeness of words and documents for NLP tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our methods.","","978-1-7281-4550-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999053","Topic Model;Unsupervised Text Analysis;Learning Word Embeddings;LDA;Document Clustering;Document Topic Information Network","Task analysis;Semantics;Context modeling;Neural networks;Linear programming;Predictive models;Buildings","matrix algebra;natural language processing;neural nets;statistical distributions;text analysis;unsupervised learning","unsupervised topic model;distributed word embeddings;natural language processing tasks;semisupervised representation learning method;PTE;semantically labeled data;unlabeled data;information networks;supervised label information;unsupervised methods;unstructured text collection;word topic network;edge weights;word-topic probability distributions;unsupervised neural network;word-document distribution;topic distribution;heterogeneous text networks;low dimensional representation;semantic closeness;large scale semantic information network;predictive text embedding;text network construction;word level semantic regularities;word level syntactic regularities;latent Dirichlet allocation;weight matrices","","","","17","","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many studies focus on the content analysis of social platforms, which assists in product promotion and sentiment investigation. On the other hand, online analytical processing (OLAP) has been proven to be very effective for analyzing multidimensional structured data. The key purpose of applying OLAP to text messages, (e.g., tweets), called text OLAP, is to mine and construct the hierarchical dimension based on the unstructured text content. In contrast to the plain texts which text OLAP usually handles, the social media content includes a wealth of social relationship information which can be employed to extract a more effective dimensional hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a topic model called twitter hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation (thLDA). Based on hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation, thLDA aims to automatically mine the hierarchical dimension of tweets' topics, which can be further employed for text OLAP on the tweets. Furthermore, thLDA uses word2vec to analyze the semantic relationships of words in tweets to obtain a more effective dimension. We conduct extensive experiments on huge quantities of Twitter data and evaluate the effectiveness of thLDA. The experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms other current topic models in mining and constructing the hierarchical dimension of tweeters' topics.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2891902","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61472112,61702144); Key Science and Technology Project of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2017C01010); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LY12F02003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8607040","Twitter;online analytical processing;topic modeling;hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation;social media analysis","Twitter;Data models;Data mining;Semantics;Resource management;Analytical models","data mining;social networking (online);text analysis","hierarchical dimension;tweets;twitter data;tweeters;hierarchical topic modeling;online analytical processing;social platforms;content analysis;product promotion;multidimensional structured data;text messages;unstructured text content;plain texts;social media content;social relationship information;topic model;twitter hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation;topic models;dimensional hierarchy;text OLAP","","17","","31","OAPA","10 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we introduced a new sentiment-topic model called the hybrid sentiment-topic model (HST). The HST model is a completely unsupervised sentiment classification method that allows for the topical context of words in documents to be accounted for when classifying sentiment. The only input needed for the model is a list of positive seed words, a list of negative seed words, and the number of topics. The HST model differs from similar models as it ensures that each objective topic discovered has both a positive sentiment-topic and negative sentiment-topic associated with it; other similar models do not guarantee symmetric sentiment-topics. The HST model performs three functions, firstly, it discovers objective topics in a corpus of text; secondly, it finds a positive and negative sentiment-topic for each objective topic; and finally, it performs sentiment classification. The HST model is tested using a dataset consisting of movie reviews and a dataset of social media posts. For each dataset a variety of seed word lists and different numbers of topics are tested; the HST model is then compared against similar sentiment-topic models. In all experiments conducted, the HST model was found to outperform similar sentiment-topic models in terms of classification accuracy by a noticeable margin. Additionally, the HST model was found to converge faster than similar models and the accuracy was found to be more stable during the Gibbs sampling process.","2375-0197","978-1-5386-3876-7","10.1109/ICTAI.2017.00076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8371979","unsupervised classification;topic models;sentiment analysis","Adaptation models;Data models;Context modeling;Mathematical model;Solid modeling;Labeling;Machine learning","pattern classification;sentiment analysis;unsupervised learning;word processing","positive seed words;HST model differs;positive sentiment-topic;negative sentiment-topic;symmetric sentiment-topics;HST model;hybrid sentiment-topic model;unsupervised sentiment classification","","4","","24","","7 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the sparsity of data, however, short-text topic modeling remains a critical yet much-watched challenge in both academia and industry. Research has been devoted to building different types of probabilistic topic models for short texts, among which self-aggregation methods emerged recently to provide informative cross-text word co-occurrences. However, models along this line are still in their infancy and typically yield overfit results and exhibit high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Pseudo-document-based Topic Model (PTM), which introduces the concept of pseudo-document to implicitly aggregate short texts against data sparsity. By modeling the topic distributions of latent pseudo-documents rather than short texts, PTM yields excellent performance in accuracy and efficiency. A word embedding-enhanced PTM (WE-PTM) is also proposed to leverage pre-trained word embeddings, which is essential to further alleviating data sparsity. Extensive experiments with self-aggregation or word embedding-based baselines on four real-world datasets including two online media short texts, demonstrate the high-quality topics learned by our models. Robustness to limited training samples and the explainable semantics of topics are also investigated.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2021.3073195","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71531001,71725002,71901012,U1636210); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9404875","Short Texts;Topic Modeling;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Pseudo-document;Word Embedding","Data models;Computational modeling;Social networking (online);Aggregates;Standards;Probabilistic logic;Training","","","","2","","","IEEE","14 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Hence a need arises to develop an approach to organize such conflicting information generated due to homographs. Topic modeling is an approach through which we can organize the information. Twitter is one such social media site which greatly challenges the researchers to interpret accurate information.

We apply this topic model to a dataset from Oculus (namely VREVIEW), and show that our model can identify some distinct, economically meaningful features for VR applications, e.g., “entertainment and fun,” “challenge,” “immersive,” and “sickness.” Our research provides implications for VR consumer behavior analysis, optimizing user experience in virtual environments, and VR application recommendation.","","978-1-6654-8402-2","10.1109/VRW55335.2022.00046","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72101072,91846201,72171071,71722010); Postdoctoral Research Foundation of China(grant numbers:2021M690852); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JZ2021HGQB0272); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9757535","Virtual Reality;Feature Identification;Topic Model;User Reviews;VR Game;Human-centered computing—Human computer interaction (HCI)—Interaction paradigms—Virtual reality;Computing methodologies—Artificial intelligence—Knowledge representation and reasoning","Solid modeling;Analytical models;Three-dimensional displays;Consumer behavior;Conferences;Virtual environments;Games","consumer behaviour;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;user experience;virtual reality","model inference;VR consumer behavior analysis;VR application recommendation;VR virtual reality applications;general topic model;sparse topic model;user reviews;VREVIEW;online platforms;feature learning;collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm;user experience;virtual environments;feature identification","","","","14","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, we propose a social-period-aware topic model (SPATM) to learn the influence weights of both user interests and her social preferences on making-decision for each check-in time automatically. Especially, we model latent topic by leveraging smaller size of dynamic activities instead of static categories, which can alleviate the data sparsity problem by using more co-occurrent activities information. Moreover, our approach can automatically judge whether a user’s social preference is periodic or aperiodic and learn the periodicity of periodic one. Furthermore, the Alias Sampling based training approach is introduced to improve sampling efficiency. The results demonstrate our proposed model is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

We select six stocks from the Dow Jones list of companies and acquire over 190,000 news published between January 2019 and September 2019. By building text processing and topic modeling pipelines, we can examine (i) the role of daily mean and medium of sentiment scores; and (ii) the influence of topic models on the classification metrics. The results demonstrate that adding a topic model has a positive effect on the model’s accuracy, which reaches higher accuracy in classifying the iv30call of the next business day in five out of six companies.

Previously proposed supervised topic model provides an avenue to associate volatility with news, yet it displays poor resolutions at extreme regions. To address this problem, we propose a novel extreme topic model to provide a better service for market alerts. By mapping extreme events into Poisson point processes, volatile regions are magnified to reveal their hidden volatility-topic relationships.

Among them, the dynamic topic model (DTM) is the most popular time-series topic model for the dynamic representations of text corpora. A major challenge is that the posterior distribution of DTM requires a complex reasoning process with the high cost of computing time in modeling, and even a tiny change of model requires restructuring. For these reasons, the variability and generality of DTM is so poor that DTM is difficult to be carried out. In this paper, we introduce a new method for constructing DTM based on variational autoencoder and factor graphs. This model uses re-parameterization of the variational lower bound to generate a lower bound estimator which is optimized by standard stochastic gradient descent method directly. At the same time, the optimization process is simplified by integrating the dynamic factor graph in the state space to achieve a better model. The experimental dataset uses a journal paper corpus that mainly focuses on natural language processing and spans twenty-five years (1984-2009) from DBLP.

Firstly, the Hybrid LSTM-CNN model is used to classify reviews, and then LDA topic model is used to extract features of positive and negative reviews. The results show that Hybrid LSTM-CNN model has better performance than the classic LSTM and CNN in sentiment classification. The LDA model mines that consumers have the positive attitude towards the products, context and ambiance of physical bookstores, and the negative attitude towards price and service.

The probabilistic topic model (PTM), which focuses on modeling topics, has been proposed to bridge the so-called semantic gap. Conventional PTMs usually model the images with a dense semantic representation and, in general, one topic space is generated for all the different features. However, this approach fails to consider the sparsity of the semantic representation, the classification quality, as well as the time consumption. In this paper, to solve the above problems, a fully sparse semantic topic model (FSSTM) framework is proposed for HSR imagery scene classification. FSSTM, with an elaborately designed modeling procedure, is able to represent the image with sparse but representative semantics. Based on this framework, the topic weights of multiple features are exploited by solving a concave maximization problem, which improves the fusion of the discriminative semantic information at the topic level. Meanwhile, the sparsity and representativeness of the topics generated by FSSTM guarantee that the image is adaptive to the change of a topic number. FSSTM can consistently achieve a good performance with a limited number of training samples, and is robust for HSR image scene classification. The experimental results obtained with three different types of HSR image data sets confirm that the proposed algorithm is effective in improving the performance of scene classification, and is highly efficient in discovering the semantics of HSR images when compared with the state-of-the-art PTM methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2709802","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0504202); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41622107,41371344); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2016CFA029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7959103","Fusion;high spatial resolution (HSR) imagery;limited training samples;probabilistic topic model (PTM);scene classification;sparsity","Semantics;Training;Feature extraction;Probabilistic logic;Visualization;Spatial resolution;Robustness","feature extraction;image classification;image resolution;optimisation;probability","high spatial resolution;HSR;imagery scene classification;probabilistic topic model;PTM;semantic gap;dense semantic representation;classification quality;fully sparse semantic topic model;FSSTM;concave maximization","","29","","48","IEEE","26 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The corpus consists of two sets of texts derived from textbooks on Social science by L.N. Bogolyubov and A.F. Nikitin. For our analysis, we employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Additive regularization of topic models (ARTM). In this paper, we use the grades of educational texts as indicators of text complexity. To identify quantitative measures of text complexity, we analyze the correlation of book grades with topic properties. We also analyze a correlation of a topic's properties with the growth of its proportion in a book of a specific complexity level. The key finding of our research is the identification of statistically significant correlations of educational texts complexity with the revealed topic features, i.e., topic coherence and distance between topic words in a semantic space.

This paper extends single-robot topic models to the domain of multiple robots. The main difficulty of this extension lies in achieving and maintaining global consensus among the unsupervised models learned locally by each robot. This is especially challenging for multi-robot teams operating in communication-constrained environments, such as marine robots. We present a novel approach for multi-robot distributed learning in which each robot maintains a local topic model to categorize its observations and model parameters are shared to achieve global consensus. We apply a combinatorial optimization procedure that combines local robot topic distributions into a globally consistent model based on topic similarity, which we find mitigates topic drift when compared to a baseline approach that matches topics naïvely, We evaluate our methods experimentally by demonstrating multi-robot underwater terrain characterization using simulated missions on real seabed imagery.

There are many recently developed augmented topic modeling methods to utilize metadata information. However, the effect of topic models is still not comparable to humans. We think one key point is that humans have background knowledge, which is essential for topic understanding. Inspired by this, we propose a knowledge base enhanced topic model in this paper. We take knowledge bases as good presentations of human knowledge, with huge collections of entities and their relations. We assume that documents with related entities tend to have similar topic distributions. Based on this assumption, we compute document similarity information via the linked entities and then use it as a constraint for LDA. More specifically, we embed entities in a low-dimensional space via DeepWalk and use Entity Movers Distance to efficiently and effectively measure the similarities between documents. The results of experiments over two real-world datasets show that our method boosts the LDA model on the document classification while no supervision information is needed.","","978-1-7281-8156-1","10.1109/ICBK50248.2020.00061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9194489","Topic Model;LDA;Knowledge Base","Knowledge based systems;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Semantics;Optimization;Resource management;Transforms","data mining;document handling;learning (artificial intelligence);meta data;pattern classification;text analysis","topic distributions;LDA model;knowledge base enhanced topic modeling;background knowledge;augmented topic;latent dirichlet allocation;text mining;DeepWalk;entity movers distance","","","","27","","11 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, it is a vital requirement to evaluate the LDA against the quality of the input. The noise and uncertainty of the content create a negative influence on the topic model. The major contribution of this investigation is to critically evaluate the LDA based on the quality of input sources and human perception. The empirical study shows the relationship between the quality of the input and the accuracy of the output generated by LDA. Perplexity and coherence have been evaluated with three data-sets (RCV1, conference data set, tweets) which contain different level of complexities and uncertainty in their contents. Human perception in generating topics has been compared with the LDA in terms of human defined topics. Results of the analysis demonstrate a strong relationship between the quality of the input and generated topics. Thus, highly relevant topics were generated from formally written contents while noisy and messy contents lead to generate meaningless topics. A considerable gap is noticed between human defined topics and LDA generated topics. Finally, a concept-based topic modeling technique is proposed to improve the quality of topics by capturing the meaning of the content and eliminating the irrelevant and meaningless topics.","","978-1-5386-7325-6","10.1109/WI.2018.00-48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8609635","LDA;content quality;topic modeling","Electrical engineering;Computer science;Coherence","information retrieval;Internet;natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis","topic model;noisy data sources;human perception;concept-based topic modeling technique;latent Dirichlet allocation;online data","","","","22","","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), 36 topic models were built (9 models for each preprocessing option). The research showed that in case of literary texts topic models built without any POS filters are the most interpretable.

Despite potentially bringing richer insights, the use of open-ended questions poses great challenges in terms of extracting useful information while significantly increasing the analysis time. Nevertheless, automatic text analysis techniques speed up the analysis of open-ended responses. In this research, we explore the potential to use techniques in topic modelling [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Supervised LDA (sLDA)] to extract information from open-ended responses. This is compared to the information obtained from closed-ended responses, accomplished using a questionnaire that measures the intention to use shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). Two versions of the questionnaire- Ver_OE and Ver_Lk were used, with open-ended and Likert scales measuring the same attitudes in the alternative versions. Factors were extracted for closed-ended questions. For questions common to both versions of the questionnaire, respondents answering Ver_OE had a higher positive attitude towards autonomous vehicles. These attitudinal questions were placed after the open-ended questions. When evaluating the performance of the models that predict the intention to use SAVs, models estimated using Ver_OE performed better. This increased further with the inclusion of the information extracted from the open-ended responses using both, the unsupervised (LDA) and supervised (sLDA) methods. No improvement was observed in the model for Ver_Lk. These indicate the potential for the use of open-ended questions to measure attitudes and topic modelling to extract information from these responses.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3040904","Short-Term Scientific Mission from COST Action TU1305 of the European Cooperation for Science and Technology and by the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT, IP), Portugal(grant numbers:PD/BD/129394/2017); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288903","Topic modelling;latent dirichlet allocation;supervised latent dirichlet allocation;Likert scales;open-ended questions;travel behaviour research","Data mining;Autonomous vehicles;Resource management;Predictive models;Frequency measurement;Standards;Social networking (online)","mobile robots;social aspects of automation;text analysis","Ver_OE;latent dirichlet allocation;sLDA;supervised LDA;SAV;shared autonomous vehicles;closed-ended questions;Ver_Lk;topic modelling;open-ended responses;automatic text analysis techniques speed;open-ended questions;factor analysis;topic modeling;closed-ended responses","","2","","63","IEEE","9 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike typical methods which only use the context information, we present the basic idea that incorporates the global sense distribution and contextual sense dependency to determine the correct sense. In this paper, we leverage the generative process of the sequence topic model to model the sense distribution from the whole global corpus directly. Since contextual sense dependency is more likely to happen between successive words, we hypothesize that the sense assignment of the target word depends on the sense of the previous word. Hence, the sense dependency could be modeled by the probabilistic topic model with hidden Markov chain assumption. Furthermore, the information in the sense inventory of WordNet is used as prior knowledge for obtaining the non-uniform sense distribution over words. It is notable that the prior knowledge contributes to parameter learning and inference during the Gibbs Sampling procedure, hence we call the proposed method a knowledge-based unsupervised approach.

Such a model assumes that text corpora result from a generative process, in which clusters and topics act as connected latent factors. Essentially, clusters are initially associated with descriptive and actionable topic distributions, that enforce cluster coherence. The individual documents are then assigned to one respective cluster and worded accordingly. Under the devised model, document clustering and topic modeling can be simultaneously performed in an interdependent manner simply by Bayesian reasoning. For this purpose, the mathematical details regarding collapsed Gibbs sampling as well as parameter estimation are derived and implemented into an approximate inference algorithm.

Each patch in SAR images has a scene category, but usually contains multiple land-cover classes or latent properties, which can be represented by topics in the probabilistic topic model (PTM). The representation and selection of discriminative features in PTM have a large impact on the classification results. Most of the existing feature learning methods do not make full use of high-level structure feature and the feature correlation within similar images to mine discriminative features. Therefore, this article proposes a discriminative sketch topic model with structural constraint (C-SSTM) for SAR image classification. In the proposed model, each image patch is characterized by structural and texture features. In particular, the sketch structural feature is based on the sketch map to represent the image local structure pattern. Then, the local image manifold information is preserved in terms of structure and texture. In the structural constraint, the texture and structure of each image patch are combined to learn discriminative latent semantic topics between image patches.

The experimental results tested on synthetic and real SAR images demonstrate that the proposed C-SSTM is able to learn effective structural feature representation from SAR images.

"Hybrid Context-Aware Word Sense Disambiguation in Topic Modeling Based Document Representation","W. Li; E.

Document representation is an essential part of various document based tasks, and word sense disambiguation is to capture the distinctions of word senses in the representation. Traditional methods mainly rely on knowledge libraries for data enrichment; however, semantics division for a word may vary from different domain-specific datasets. We aim to discover more particular word semantic differences for each input dataset and handle the disambiguation problem without data enrichment. The challenge for this disambiguation is to (1) divide various senses for each polysemous word while (2) preserve the differences between synonyms. Most of the existing models are either based on separate context clusters or integrating an auxiliary module to specify word senses. They can hardly achieve both (1) and (2) since different senses of a word are assumed to be independent and their intrinsic relationships are ignored. To solve this problem, we estimate a word sense by both the context in which it occurs and the contexts of its other occurrences. Besides, we introduce the “Bag-of-Senses” (BoS) assumption: a document is a multiset of word senses, and the senses are generated instead of the words. Our experiments on three standard datasets show that our proposal outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy of word sense estimation, topic modeling, and document classification.","2374-8486","978-1-7281-8316-9","10.1109/ICDM50108.2020.00042","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:JP18H03290); China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201706680067); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9338354","document representation, topic model, word sense disambiguation","Adaptation models;Semantics;Estimation;Data models;Proposals;Task analysis;Context modeling","data mining;natural language processing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;text analysis","hybrid context-aware word sense disambiguation;topic modeling;document representation;hybrid context based topic model;document based tasks;data enrichment;polysemous word;word sense estimation;word semantic differences;bag-of-senses;BoS","","1","","47","","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tweets were collected a week following the announcement of Operation Warp Speed and were cleaned and labeled as anti-vaxx and pro-vaxx. Topic modeling was applied separately to these anti-vaxx and pro-vaxx groups of tweets. Anti-vaxx tweets lead to four themes: (i) lack of safety especially due to rushed development, (ii) conspiracy and conflict of interest, (iii) ideology, globalism and new world order, and (iv) loss of personal choice and freedom. Pro-vaxxers hope to convince skeptics by touting prior success of immunizations and express concern at the rise of anti-vaxx movement on Facebook and Twitter. Furthermore, they accuse anti-vaxxers of spreading falsehoods and misinformation. In addition to these concerns, however, pro-vaxxers mock, ridicule and insult anti-vaxxers in unflattering, disrespectful and derogatory tones.

For these services, it is assumed that the interests of users gradually change and narrow down during browsing. Then, when the users decide the product to purchase, it is considered that their interests converge on a specific subject. Therefore, it is important to implement appropriate marketing strategies depending on the degree of convergence of user interests to increase effectiveness. Therefore, a method that can analyze changing user interests over time from browsing history data is desired. In this study, we propose a Time Window Topic Model that can analyze changes in user interests by considering the interests as latent topics.

In this paper, we propose a novel topic model for short text called GPU-BTM, which incorporates Generalized Pólya Urn technique into Biterm Topic Model. GPU-BTM utilizes the similarity information and the co-occurrence pattern of words simultaneously to handle the sparsity problem. Specifically, the GPU module considers the similarity information among words, so that GPU-BTM generates more coherent topics. On the other hand, BTM module tries to capture the co-occurrence pattern of words so that the enriched contexts relieve the data sparsity problem. In the experiment part, the results demonstrate that GPU-BTM model outperforms four latest comparison models on two real world short text datasets.","","978-1-7281-9558-2","10.1109/DSC50466.2020.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172425","short text;topic model;auxiliary information","","data mining;text analysis;word processing","data sparsity problem;similarity information;GPU-BTM model;topic information extraction;biterm topic model;auxiliary information;generalized Polya Urn technique;real world short text datasets","","","","28","IEEE","21 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Topic modeling is an area of Text Mining which is being used in various areas e.g. summarization, searching, semantics, and many other. Topic Modeling is used to uncover the hidden topics from large collection of documents or text. It is also equally important for many other interesting research areas like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), statistics etc. In order to fulfill the goal of topic model, a lot of models have been proposed, in literature, for variety of languages such as English and Arabic etc. All of the models differ in their various nature, theories, and implementation strategies as all languages has their own morphological structure, semantics and syntax. The motivation behind this work is that there is no such work is available for Urdu language to extract topics from documents. Although some standard Topic Models has been proposed such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), there is still a need of development of comprehensive model to cater Topic Model specific for Urdu text. In this research, we have proposed an effective topic model for Urdu language to cope with the challenges of Urdu morphological structure. The proposed Topic Model for Urdu is a framework that combine pre-processing techniques, LDA model and Gibbs sampling. This proposed Topic Model for Urdu used the standard LDA model therefore we named it Urdu Latent Dirichlet Allocation (ULDA).

Each document is generated using one of the topic proportion vectors and language-specific word distributions. By inferring a topic proportion vector used for each document, we can allocate documents in different languages into common clusters, where each cluster is associated with a topic proportion vector. Documents assigned into the same cluster are considered to be matched. We develop an efficient inference procedure for the proposed model based on collapsed Gibbs sampling.

Existed Expert Identification work is mainly based on traditional information retrieval, or standard topic models. Experts finding still faces a lot of problems, such as the missing of semantic information or the inaccuracy without changes over time taken into consideration. This paper presents a domain Expert Identification method with the improved dynamic LDA algorithm which solves these shortcomings of existed methods. Based on the standard LDA model, this method divides the corpus with large time span according to time to apply the dynamic LDA model and combines profile modelling and file modelling for expert modelling. In addition, this method considers both the semantic information of the domain and expert authority. Experiments show its feasibility and effectiveness, and its advantage over the traditional static topic model. It has opened up new application fields of dynamic topic model.","","978-1-5386-4210-8","10.1109/DSC.2018.00141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8411962","Expert Identification;LDA;dynamic topic model;expert modelling","Semantics;Analytical models;Data models;Standards;Predictive models;Heuristic algorithms;Probabilistic logic","identification;information retrieval;text analysis","human society;information society;knowledge society;semantic information;file modelling;expert authority;expert modelling;expert finding;information retrieval;topic models;expert identification method;dynamic LDA algorithm;profile modelling","","3","","23","","19 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This type of sharing is widespread and is sometimes the first communication of topics of public discussion. Therefore, research on identifying public opinion topics on social networks is of great significance. However, social network posts are short, sparse and noisy, which creates challenges for this research. To overcome these challenges, we propose a spatial-temporal emergency topic model (ST-ETM) to identify public opinion topics in social networks. By introducing spatial-temporal features into the topic model to construct spatial-temporal regions for focusing on topics, the ST-ETM can alleviate the sparsity problem of context in social networks and succeed in focusing on public opinion topics. Moreover, to automatically identify public opinion topics, we introduce the burstiness of the words as a priori in the model, and binary switch variables are combined to automatically identify public opinion topics in social networks. Based on a real Sina Weibo dataset, several comparative experiments are designed to evaluate the performance of our ST-ETM.

However, for finding shots with certain semantic content in these videos, it is still a problem to annotate video shots by labels. Some existing approaches train models with annotated shots which cost a lot in labeling manually. Some other methods in solving this kind of task assume that the content of a video is only limited in the labels of the video. They ignore that the labels of a video are too coarse-grained to cover all content of the video. In this paper, we propose a multi-label, multi-instance topic model to annotate video shots by video labels. In a multi-label, multi-instance framework, video shots can be regarded as instances and shot labels are learned from labels in video level which makes the cost of labeling cheaper. On the other hand, our model learns label semantics by controlling the relationship between video labels and shots to solve coarse-grained problem. Furthermore, we also learn keywords for every video. The experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset show that our model outperforms other baseline models substantially.","","978-1-7281-6597-4","10.1109/CSCWD49262.2021.9437805","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9437805","video shots annotating;multi-label multi-instance;topic model;time-sync video comments","Computers;Training;Visualization;TV;Computational modeling;Semantics;Collaborative work","learning (artificial intelligence);video retrieval;video signal processing","video labels;multiinstance multilabel topic model;video shots;movie videos;annotated shots;multiinstance topic model;multiinstance framework;shot labels;video level;label semantics","","","","19","","28 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We argue that community users’ views of a paper may also provide insights at the time of recommendation. For example, if a paper on fake image detection has been cited heavily by machine learning papers, such a feature should be absorbed in the embedding of this paper, so that it can be recommended for future query on machine learning. In this paper, we present a Graph Convolutional Network-strengthened Topic Modeling (GCN-TM) method, which employs GCN technique to refine topic modeling of scientific papers. A citation-oriented knowledge graph is constructed, and topic modeling is mapped to feature embedding of the comprising papers. On top of its own topics carried in its content, each paper learns topics from its neighbors and revise its embedding accordingly.

In contrast to simple activities such as walking that involve single, indivisible repeated actions, recognizing complex activities such as ""having dinner"" is a harder sub-problem that may be composed of multiple interleaved or concurrent simple activities with different orderings each time. Most of prior work has focused on recognizing simple activities, used hand-crafted features, or did not perform classification using a state-of-the-art neural networks model. In this paper, we propose CARTMAN, a complex activity recognition method that uses Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models to generate smartphone sensor features that capture the latent representation of complex activities. These LDA features are then classified using a DeepConvLSTM neural network with self-attention. DeepConvLSTM auto-learns the spatio-temporal features from the sensor data while the self-attention layer identifies and focuses on the predictive points within the time-series sensor data.

As a result, ride-hailing service providers utilize social media for capturing customers' opinions and marketing their services. If customers' statements about ride-hailing services are analyzed further, service providers can get insight for evaluating their services to meet customers' satisfaction. Text mining approach can be useful to analyze large number of posts and various writing styles to extract hidden information. Furthermore, by applying topic modeling, service providers can identify the important points that were spoken by customers without previously giving label or category to the text. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used in this study to extract topics based on the posts from ride-hailing customers published on Twitter. This study used 40 parameter combinations for LDA to get the best one to obtain the topics. Based on the perplexity value, there were 9 topics discussed by customers in their posts including the top words in each topic.

With an increase in unstructured data around us, it is very difficult to analyse the data very easily. There is a need for some methods that can be applied to the data to get the sensitive and semantic information from the corpus. Text classification is categorization of text in organised way for the interpretation of sensitive information from the text, while Topic modelling is finding the abstract topic for the collection of text or document. Topic modelling is used frequently to find semantic information from the textual data. In this paper we applied Parsing techniques on various websites to extract the HTML and XML data which includes the textual data and also applied Preprocessing techniques to clean the data. For the text classification purpose some of the Machine learning based classifiers that we have used in our experiment are Naive Bayes and also Logistic Regression Classifier. The models of the document are built using three different topic modelling methods which are Latent Semantic Analysis, Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. In the further experiment we have done analysis and also comparison based upon the performance of the models and classifiers on the processed textual data.","","978-1-6654-1836-2","10.1109/GCAT52182.2021.9587459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9587459","Text Classification;Naive Bayes;Logistic Regression;Topic Modelling;Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA);Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA);Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA);Parsing.","Analytical models;Semantics;Text categorization;XML;Machine learning;Predictive models;Feature extraction","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis;text analysis;XML","processed textual data;Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis;different topic modelling methods;text classification purpose;abstract topic;semantic information;sensitive information;unstructured data;text analysis;web extracted data","","","","22","IEEE","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, topic models have been widely adopted to discover the underlying semantic themes (i.e., topics). Supervised topic models have emerged to leverage discovered topics for predicting the response of interest (e.g., product quality and sales). However, supervised topic modeling remains a challenging problem because of the need to prespecify the number of topics, the lack of predictive information in topics, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised topic model, Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-based Inverse Regression (HDP-IR). HDP-IR characterizes the corpus with a flexible number of topics, which prove to retain as much predictive information as the original corpus. Moreover, we develop an efficient inference algorithm capable of examining large-scale corpora (millions of documents or more). Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the predictive performance over major e-commerce benchmark testbeds of online reviews. Overall, HDP-IR outperformed existing state-of-the-art supervised topic models. Particularly, retaining sufficient predictive information improved predictive R-squared by over 17.6 percent; having topic structure flexibility contributed to predictive R-squared by at least 4.1 percent.

One challenge, common to all topic models, is the determination of the number of latent topics (aka model determination). Determining the correct number of topics is important: underestimating the number of topics results in a poor topic separation, under-fitting, while overestimating leads to noisy topics, over-fitting. Here, we introduce SeNMFk, a semantic-assisted NMF-based topic modeling method, which incorporates semantic correlations in NMF by using a word-context matrix, and employs a method for determination of the number of latent topics. SeNMFk first creates a random ensemble of matrices based on the initial TF-IDF matrix and a word-context matrix, and then applies a coupled factorization to acquire sets of stable coherent topics that are robust to noise. The latent dimension is determined based on the stability of these topics. We show that SeNMFk accurately determines the number of high-quality topics in benchmark text corpora, which leads to an accurate document clustering.","","978-1-7281-8470-8","10.1109/ICMLA51294.2020.00060","Los Alamos National Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9356214","NMF;Topic models;Document clustering;NLP","Semantics;Benchmark testing;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Stability analysis;Matrix decomposition;Noise measurement","knowledge representation;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;natural language processing;pattern clustering;random processes;text analysis","coupled factorization;matrix random ensemble;over-fitting;under-fitting;matrix decomposition;document clustering;latent dimension;semantic correlations;text corpus;semantic nonnegative matrix factorization;semantic-assisted NMF-based topic modeling;TF-IDF matrix;word-context matrix;SeNMFk;latent topics;low-rank nonnegative matrices;term frequency-inverse document frequency representation;automatic model determination","","1","","42","","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many topic modeling approaches have been developed under the premise that each topic has a characteristic anchor word that only appears in that topic. The anchor-word assumption is fragile in practice, because words and terms have multiple uses; yet it is commonly adopted because it enables identifiability guarantees. Remedies in the literature include using three- or higher-order word co-occurrence statistics to come up with tensor factorization models, but such statistics need many more samples to obtain reliable estimates, and identifiability still hinges on additional assumptions, such as consecutive words being persistently drawn from the same topic. In this work, we propose a new topic identification criterion using second order statistics of the words. The criterion is theoretically guaranteed to identify the underlying topics even when the anchor-word assumption is grossly violated. An algorithm based on alternating optimization, and an efficient primal-dual algorithm are proposed to handle the resulting identification problem. The former exhibits high performance and is completely parameter-free; the latter affords up to 200 times speedup relative to the former, but requires step-size tuning and a slight sacrifice in accuracy. A variety of real text corpora are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the approach, where the proposed anchor-free method demonstrates substantial improvements compared to a number of anchor-word based approaches under various evaluation metrics.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2827377","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1608961,IIS-1247632); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671411,U1709219,61374020); Fundamental Research Funds; National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LR15F010002); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1526078,CMMI-1727757); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:15RT0767); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8338424","Topic modeling;identifiability;anchor free;sufficiently scattered;non-convex optimization;nonnegative matrix factorization","Correlation;Biological system modeling;Analytical models;Optimization;Data models;Games;Tensile stress","convergence of numerical methods;data mining;matrix decomposition;optimisation;statistical analysis;tensors;text analysis;word processing","anchor-free correlated topic modeling;anchor-word assumption;higher-order word co-occurrence statistics;tensor factorization models;topic identification criterion;anchor-word based approaches;second order statistics;alternating optimization;primal-dual algorithm","","8","","39","IEEE","16 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Through a manual analysis of extracted topics, we identified the situation in the country during a selected period and how it has impacted the vegetable prices.

However, all travel histories of a user are regarded as one document drawn from a set of static topics, ignoring the evolving of topics and travel preferences. In this paper, we propose a dynamic topic model (DTM) and matrix factorization (MF)-based travel recommendation method. A DTM is used to obtain the temporally fine-grained topic distributions (i.e., implicit topic information) of users and locations. In addition, a large amount of explicit information is extracted from the metadata and visual contents of CCGPs, check-ins, and point of interest categories datasets. The information is used to obtain user-user and location-location similarity information, which is imposed as two regularization terms to constraint MF.

Different from other knowledge-based topic models which extract the knowledge information directly from the train dataset itself or even from the human judgements, for our work, we take advantage of the prior knowledge from the external knowledge base (Freebase 1, in our experiment).

First, despite intense efforts toward nonparametric/post-training methods, the search for the optimal number of topics K remains a fundamental question in topic modeling and warrants input from domain experts. Second, with the development of more sophisticated models, topic modeling is now ironically been treated as a black box and it becomes increasingly difficult to tell how research findings are informed by data, model specifications, or inference algorithms. Based on about 120,000 newspaper articles retrieved from three major Canadian newspapers (Globe and Mail, Toronto Star, and National Post) since 1977, we employ five methods with different model specifications and inference algorithms (Latent Semantic Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Principal Component Analysis, Factor Analysis, Nonnegative Matrix Factorization) to identify discussion topics. The optimal topics are then assessed using three measures: coherence statistics, held-out likelihood (loss), and graph-based dimensionality selection.

Then with this, it becomes increasingly difficult to find what to look for and what is needed. At this time the tools to search, organize, and understand a large amount of collected information will be expensive and a lot of time to do the research. With some structured data and unstructured data, it will be difficult to get relevant information as desired. One of the techniques in this field is text mining, also known as text mining, one of which is topic modeling.Based on the results of testing conducted on four nationally accredited information technology journals, the resulting group of topics is topics discussed in several theories and implementation of information technology, especially in the field of information systems and informatics. The use of lemmatization and Term Frequency for research with Indonesian data on topic modeling is quite effective as seen from the results of preprocessing text data. Most relevant topics generated from each iteration of terms do not exceed the value of 50% for each topic, meaning that their relevance is not too dominant in specific discussions about information technology but in certain data cases that cause evenly the composition of terms in each journal topic document.","","978-1-6654-4402-6","10.1109/ICWT52862.2021.9678424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678424","Lemmatization;Text Mining;Topic Modeling;Indonesian Journal;Most Relevance Topic","Text mining;Wireless communication;Vocabulary;Social networking (online);Telematics;Data models;Information technology","","","","","","11","","18 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Motivated by the intuitive assumption that different words have varying degree of discriminative power in delivering the objective sense or the subjective sense with respect to their assigned topics, a model named as identified objective-subjective latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (iosLDA) is proposed in this paper. In the iosLDA model, the simple Pólya urn model adopted in traditional topic models is modified by incorporating it with a probabilistic generative process, in which the novel “Bag-of-Discriminative-Words” (BoDW) representation for the documents is obtained; each document has two different BoDW representations with regard to objective and subjective senses, respectively, which are employed in the joint objective and subjective classification instead of the traditional Bag-of-Topics representation. The experiments reported on documents and images demonstrate that: 1) the BoDW representation is more predictive than the traditional ones; 2) iosLDA boosts the performance of topic modeling via the joint discovery of latent topics and the different objective and subjective power hidden in every word; and 3) iosLDA has lower computational complexity than supervised LDA, especially under an increasing number of topics.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2626379","National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2015CB352300); NSFC(grant numbers:U1509206,61572431,61472353); China Knowledge Centre for Engineering Science and Technology; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7820202","Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA);latent variable model;supervised learning;topic modeling","Predictive models;Color;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Visualization;Resource management;Probabilistic logic","computational complexity;document image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability;text analysis;vocabulary","topic modeling;distinct words;objective identification;subjective words identification;Pólya urn model;lower computational complexity;supervised LDA;images demonstration;objective-subjective latent Dirichlet allocation;bag-of-topics representation;novel bag-of-discriminative-words;BoDW representation;subjective classification;joint objective;probabilistic generative process;iosLDA model;discriminative power;subjective sense;objective sense","","13","","45","IEEE","17 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Generally, the difference in generative topic models is how these mixtures of topics are generated. We propose looking at topic models in a new way, as topic-noise models. Our topic-noise model defines a document as a mixture of topics and noise. Topic Noise Discriminator (TND) estimates both the topic and noise distributions using not only the relationships between words in documents, but also the linguistic relationships found using word embeddings. This type of model is important for short, sparse social media posts that contain both random and non-random noise. We also understand that topic quality is subjective and that researchers may have preferences. Therefore, we propose a variant of our model that combines the pre-trained noise distribution from TND in an ensemble with any generative topic model to filter noise words and produce more coherent and diverse topic sets. We present this approach using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and show that it is effective for maintaining high quality LDA topics while removing noise within them. Finally, we show the value of using a context-specific noise list generated from TND to remove noise statically, after topics have been generated by any topic model, including non-generative ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of all three of these approaches that explicitly model context-specific noise in document collections.","2374-8486","978-1-6654-2398-4","10.1109/ICDM51629.2021.00017","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679037","generative topic modeling;topic noise model","Codes;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Linguistics;Data models;Resource management;Noise measurement","random noise;social networking (online);text analysis","topic-Noise models;modeling topic;noise distributions;generative topic model;topic-noise model;Topic Noise Discriminator;nonrandom noise;topic quality;pre-trained noise distribution;noise words;coherent topic sets;diverse topic sets;explicitly model context-specific noise","","1","","29","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Incorporating such meta information directly into the generative process of topic models can improve modelling accuracy and topic quality, especially in the case where the word-occurrence information in the training data is insufficient. In this paper, we present a topic model, called MetaLDA, which is able to leverage either document or word meta information, or both of them jointly. With two data argumentation techniques, we can derive an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm, which benefits from the fully local conjugacy of the model. Moreover, the algorithm is favoured by the sparsity of the meta information. Extensive experiments on several real world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves comparable or improved performance in terms of both perplexity and topic quality, particularly in handling sparse texts.

So the significance of extracting knowledge from these data is invaluable for various sectors. However, the number of works in this field is inadequate because of the lack of proper datasets, tools, and applications. Therefore, preparing a convenient dataset in Bangla can be a great help for topic modeling as well as for other NLP related research. In this paper, we have addressed some of those complications by creating a proper dataset. Also, we have demonstrated a method of observing the Bangla media trend by applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on newspaper articles.

It is important to identify these different topics and sentiments in order to gauge public opinion, use the insights to develop policies, and make necessary adjustments or actions to improve public image and reputation of the administering agency and the COVID-19 vaccines themselves. This paper proposes a semi-supervised machine learning pipeline to perform topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and an analysis of vaccine brand reputation to obtain an in-depth understanding of national public opinion of Filipinos on Facebook. The methodology makes use of a multilingual version of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers or BERT for topic modeling, hierarchical clustering, five different classifiers for sentiment analysis, and cosine similarity of BERT topic embeddings for vaccine brand reputation analysis. Results suggest that any type of COVID-19 misinformation is an emergent property of COVID-19 public opinion, and that the detection of COVID-19 misinformation can be an unsupervised task. Sentiment analysis aided by hierarchical clustering reveal that 21 of the 25 topics extrapolated by topic modeling are negative topics. Such negative comments spike in count whenever the Department of Health in the Philippines posts about the COVID-19 situation in other countries. Additionally, the high numbers of laugh reactions on the Facebook posts by the same agency-without any humorous content-suggest that the reactors of these posts tend to react the way they do, not because of what the posts are about but because of who posted them.","2325-6516","978-1-6654-3418-8","10.1109/ICSC52841.2022.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9736280","COVID-19;vaccine brand reputation;vaccine hesitancy;sentiment analysis;topic modeling","COVID-19;Analytical models;Sentiment analysis;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Bit error rate;Pipelines","learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);text analysis","vaccine hesitancy;complaints;Philippines;public image;COVID-19 vaccines;topic modeling;national public opinion;hierarchical clustering;BERT topic embeddings;vaccine brand reputation analysis;COVID-19 misinformation;COVID-19 public opinion;negative topics;COVID-19 situation;clade-assisted sentiment analysis;COVID-19 vaccine-related Facebook comments","","1","","15","IEEE","23 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We can comprehend users activity in more detail than self check-in based data. The main purpose of this research is to extract and interpret user preferences from big geospatial data. Because the auto-detected data is big and spatial, it is necessary to process and analyze it for transformation to a value. Firstly, we extract the spots where people visited and stayed from raw geodata. Next, we categorize spots using the spot information to reduce the dimension. Finally, we interpret user preferences by applying a topic model to the matrix of users and the categorized spot. Our results show that we can interpret user preferences as topics from big geospatial data using dimension reduction and a topic model.

A probabilistic topic model (PTM) finds a set of hidden topics from a collection of text documents. It defines each topic as a probability distribution over words and describes each document as a probability mixture of topic distributions. Learning algorithms for topic models are usually based on Bayesian inference or log-likelihood maximization. In both cases, EM-like algorithms are used. In this paper, we propose to replace the logarithm in the log-likelihood by an arbitrary smooth loss function. We prove that such a modification preserves both the structure of the algorithm and compatibility with any regularizers in terms of additive regularization of topic models (ARTM). Moreover, in the case of a linear loss, the Estep becomes much faster due to the omission of a normalization. We study combinations of the fast and usual E-steps and compare them to regularization using different number of topics in both offline and online versions of EM-algorithm. For an empirical comparison of the algorithms, we estimate perplexity, coherence, and learning time. We use an efficient parallel implementation of the EM-algorithm from the BigARTM open-source library. We show that in most cases the two-stage strategy wins, which uses fast E-steps at the beginning of iterations, then proceeds with usual E-steps.","2305-7254","978-952-69244-2-7","10.23919/FRUCT48808.2020.9087559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9087559","","Training;Technological innovation;Text analysis;Probabilistic logic;Inference algorithms;Probability distribution;Libraries","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);maximum likelihood estimation","topic modeling;probabilistic topic model;topic distributions;arbitrary smooth loss function;additive regularization of topic models;EM-algorithm;BigARTM open-source library","","1","","21","","7 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider an elementary step of this scenario in which the search intent can be expressed by a long text query. For this case, we develop an exploratory search engine based on probabilistic topic modeling. Topic model gives a low-dimensional sparse interpretable vector representation (topical embedding) of a text. The search engine uses these embeddings for ranking documents by their similarity to the query. We show that performing only one query, the topic-based search engine achieves better precision and recall that human assessors do spending up to one hour in a conventional browse-refine loop. We use additive regularization for topic modeling (ARTM) to make the model simultaneously sparse, decorrelated, n-gram, multimodal and hierarchical. We show experimentally that each of these features of the model is important to achieve precision and recall higher than 90%. Topical hierarchy emulates a natural human strategy to focus on subtopics gradually discarding unnecessary information. Also we show that increasing the number of levels in the hierarchy improves the search quality and makes it possible to enrich the model with a larger number of topics. We use the fast parallel implementation of the regularized EM-algorithm from BigARTM open source project.

It is widely recognized that sentiment lexicon as a useful prior knowledge is crucial in sentiment analysis or opinion mining. However, many existing sentiment lexicons are constructed ignoring the variability of the sentiment polarities of words in different topics or domains. For example, the word “amazing” can refer to causing great surprise or wonder but can also refer to very impressive and excellent. In TaSL, we solve this issue by jointly considering the topics and sentiments of words. Documents are represented by multiple pairs of topics and sentiments, where each pair is characterized by a multinomial distribution over words. Meanwhile, this generating process is supervised under hierarchical supervision information of documents and words. The main advantage of TaSL is that the sentiment polarity of each word in different topics can be sufficiently captured. This model is beneficial to construct a domain-specific sentiment lexicon and then effectively improve the performance of sentiment classification. Extensive experimental results on four publicly available datasets, MR, OMD, semEval13A, and semEval16B were presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach. The results have shown that TaSL performs better than the existing manual sentiment lexicon (MPQA), the topic model based domain-specific lexicon (ssLDA), the expanded lexicons(Weka-ED, Weka-STS, NRC, Liu's), and deep neural network based lexicons (nnLexicon, HIT, HSSWE).","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2019.2892232","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61822601,61773050,61632004); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:Z180006); Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission(grant numbers:Z181100008918012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8607058","Sentiment analysis;topic model;sentiment lexicon construction;opinion mining;text mining","Speech processing;Sentiment analysis;Modeling;Probabilistic logic;Sun;Neural networks;Motion pictures","data mining;pattern classification;probability;sentiment analysis","sentiment lexicon construction;topic-adaptive sentiment lexicon;sentiment analysis;opinion mining;hierarchical supervision information;sentiment classification;hierarchical supervision topic model;multinomial distribution","","18","","48","IEEE","10 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In these approaches, the documents in the collection are all about one topic. However, user's interests can be diverse and the documents in the collection often involve multiple topics. Topic modeling is useful for the area of machine learning and text mining. It generates models to discover the hidden multiple topics in a collection of documents and each of these topics are presented by distribution of words. But its effectiveness in information filtering has not been so well explored. Patterns are always thought to be more discriminative than single terms for describing documents. The major challenge found in frequent pattern mining is a large number of result patterns. As the minimum threshold becomes lower, an exponentially large number of patterns are generated. To deal with the above mentioned limitations and problems, in this paper, a novel information filtering model, EFITM (Enhanced Frequent Itemsets based on Topic Model) model is proposed. Experimental results using the CRANFIELD dataset for the task of information filtering show that the proposed model outperforms over state-of-the-art models.","","978-1-5090-5507-4","10.1109/ICIS.2017.7959986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7959986","Topic Modeling;Pattern Mining;Information Filtering;User Interest Modeling;Text Documents","Itemsets;Information filtering;Semantics;Resource management;Probabilistic logic;Computational modeling","data mining;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","information filtering;machine learning;text mining;enhanced frequent itemsets based on topic model;EFITM","","4","","25","","29 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since, gene expression data have large numbers of variables, high dimensional clustering methods are required for analysis. The objectives of this study were to understand the effectiveness of different clustering methods in gene expression data analysis based on biological relatedness and study of the advantages and disadvantages of different clustering strategies in gene expression analysis. The data was obtained from the GSE19830 dataset and the brain tumor data (TCGA project). To test the hard clustering, hierarchical clustering and fuzzy clustering, the K-means algorithm, HClust and topic modeling were used respectively. Prior knowledge about the dataset was required to define the number of clusters (K). Initially, the GSE19830 (Brain, Lung, Liver tissue mixture) dataset was used for developing the clusters. All models clustered the observations similar to the physical tags in the dataset. Secondly, Clustering methods were developed with the brain tumor dataset consisting of 202 samples (four specified physically categorized tumors). According to hierarchical clustering and topic modeling, when analyzing similar tissues, gene expression tumor subtypes (clusters) were not aligned with physical categorization. Finally, 81 cancer genes were filtered and generated a topic model. In order to understand the biological relevance of the final model, Reactome and PCViz tools were used. Reactome results supported topics developed from topic modeling. According to the results, in high dimensional data analysis, topic modeling was found to be a promising approach for gene expression based clustering while K-means was found to be inappropriate for gene clustering.","","978-1-6654-2000-6","10.1109/ICITR54349.2021.9657380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9657380","Topic modeling;clustering;gene expression","Analytical models;Data analysis;Clustering methods;Biological system modeling;Clustering algorithms;Lung;Brain modeling","bioinformatics;biological tissues;brain;cancer;data analysis;fuzzy set theory;genetics;liver;medical computing;pattern clustering;tumours","gene expression tumor subtypes;cancer genes;gene clustering;topic modeling method;high dimensional gene expression data analysis;high dimensional clustering methods;GSE19830 dataset;brain tumor data;hard clustering;hierarchical clustering;fuzzy clustering;brain tumor dataset;k-means algorithm;HClust;Reactome tool;PCViz tool","","","","7","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Secondly, the documents are topic modeled to use the document-topic score as features into the classification model. The concerned graph is constructed using Point-Wise Mutual Information (PMI) between pair of word co-occurrences and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) score for words in the documents for word co-occurrences.

Extraction of topic keywords from these unstructured social media texts play a significant role in building any application for emergency management. Topic models have the ability to discover latent topics and latent feature representations of words in a document collection and can be used for this purpose. The main aim of this paper is twofold: to explore topic model implementations and look at its effectiveness on short messages (as short as 140 characters); and to perform an exploratory data analysis on short texts related to crises collected from Twitter, and look at different visualizations to understand the commonality and differences between topics and different crisis related data.","","978-1-5386-4652-6","10.1109/IRC.2018.00078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8329942","topic models;LDA;machine learning;tweets;short texts","Twitter;Floods;Libraries;Hurricanes;Heating systems;Data models","data analysis;emergency management;social networking (online);text analysis","crisis data;social media platforms;emergency management;unstructured social media texts;topic model implementations;short messages;exploratory data analysis;short texts;topic keyword extraction","","2","","27","","5 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Landscape Studies Initiative and Data Science Institute at the University of Virginia have partnered together to construct a SQL aided application (Flask) that will assist in deep annotation of scholarly texts. Our goal was to utilize machine learning techniques, specifically named entity recognition models (NER) and topic models (TM), not only to optimize the annotation process, but also to provide a fresh perspective on the text through a new index. In this paper, we will look at the training system, design, and architecture of several different NER models, including Python's spaCy, Stanford's Named Entity Recognizer, and IBM Bluemix's Natural Language Understanding tool, and compare their accuracies. Additionally, this paper aims to explore topic modeling from different tools and techniques, such as the Python libraries Gensim and Mallet in order to compare and contrast the relevance of those models to our dataset. The impact that these techniques have on the humanities fields can be astoundingly influential, but severely limited by the availability, size, and domain of the training dataset.

Assigning topic labels to contents, that accurately capture the meaning and contextual information, is a fundamental problem in organizing unstructured data. The usage of manually-assigned tags for this purpose introduces inconsistencies because of different ""surface forms"". On the other hand, existing automated approaches either use hierarchical multi-label classification, or are unsupervised and rely on (undirected) graph measures leveraging taxonomies. While the former requires large training data set to learn the characteristics of each topic class, the latter lacks the flexibility to learn broad range of related topics and are less accurate.We propose a novel framework, ANNOTATE based on a small set of features and directed traversal of taxonomies to learn a broad spectrum of related topics using limited training data. We also show that our approach provides accurate labels for several domains without the need for re-training. For instance, the framework, trained on a small set of BBC news articles, exhibits close matches to user-generated tags for Quora documents. Experimental results, on the same model, for news classification and identifying aspects of Amazon product reviews, based on Amazon Mechanical Turk evaluation show our approach to be significantly better than state-of-the-art.We further present real-life case studies of our proposed framework for automatically tagging Quora posts, and topically segmenting, indexing and linking related YouTube videos (using our publicly available Chrome browser extension).","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622647","","Taxonomy;Labeling;Semantics;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet","Big Data;graph theory;indexing;information retrieval;Internet;online front-ends;pattern classification;social networking (online)","unstructured multimodal data;contextual information;fundamental problem;unstructured data;manually-assigned tags;automated approaches;hierarchical multilabel classification;graph measures;taxonomies;training data set;topic class;accurate labels;user-generated tags;news classification;identifying aspects;indexing;unstructured contents;big data paradigm;surface forms;Amazon Mechanical Turk evaluation;Quora posts;YouTube videos;BBC news articles;topic labels;ANNOTATE","","","","44","","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To tackle this problem, a novel discriminative joint-feature topic model (DJTM) with dual constraints is proposed to classify multiple abnormalities in WCE images. We first propose a joint-feature probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) model, where color and texture descriptors extracted from same image patches are jointly modeled with their conditional distributions. Then the proposed dual constraints: visual words importance and local image manifold are embedded into the joint-feature PLSA model simultaneously to obtain discriminative latent semantic topics. The visual word importance is proposed in our DJTM to guarantee that visual words with similar importance come from close latent topics while the local image manifold constraint enforces that images within the same category share similar latent topics. Finally, each image is characterized by distribution of latent semantic topics instead of low level features. Our proposed DJTM showed an excellent overall recognition accuracy 90.78%.

Consequently, shortened time to knowledge discovery is a challenge when investigating new methods, developing new tools, or integrating datasets. The challenge for a domain scientist particularly lies in the actions to obtain guidance through query of massive information from diverse text corpus comprising of a wide-ranging set of topics. In this paper, we propose a novel ""domain-specific topic model"" (DSTM) that can drive conversational agents for users to discover latent knowledge patterns about relationships among research topics, tools and datasets from exemplar scientific domains. The goal of DSTM is to perform data mining to obtain meaningful guidance via a chatbot for domain scientists to choose the relevant tools or datasets pertinent to solving a computational and data intensive research problem at hand. Our DSTM is a Bayesian hierarchical model that extends the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to infer latent patterns within a specific domain in an unsupervised manner. We apply our DSTM to large collections of data from bioinformatics and neuroscience domains that include hundreds of papers from reputed journal archives, hundreds of tools and datasets. Through evaluation experiments with a perplexity metric, we show that our model has better generalization performance within a domain for discovering highly specific latent topics.","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622309","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622309","Topic Model;Theoretical Model for Big Data;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Multi-disciplinary Knowledge Discovery;Computation and Data Intensive Applications","Tools;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Bioinformatics;Data models;Neuroscience;Mathematical model","Bayes methods;Big Data;bioinformatics;data analysis;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;natural sciences computing;query processing;text analysis;Web services","conversational agents;Data intensive scientific communities;machine learning techniques;Big Data analytics;data intensive communities;bioinformatics;neuroscience domain sciences;innovative advances;domain communities;multidisciplinary knowledge discovery;cross-domain collaborations;shortened time;integrating datasets;domain scientist;diverse text corpus comprising;DSTM;latent knowledge patterns;exemplar scientific domains;computational data;Bayesian hierarchical model;Latent Dirichlet Allocation model;latent patterns;neuroscience domains;highly specific latent topics;domain-specific topic model","","5","","17","","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, topic modeling of microblogs is relatively an unexplored area. A prime challenge is to automatically segregate the data into the abstract topics that they belong to, so that a user need not manually search for posts of his/her delight, but can easily move to the particular topic which provides the sets of related records.

Generative methods, designed to model common occurring patterns, could potentially advance the understanding of this disease, but have not been fully explored for AD characterization. Moreover, the introduction of a supervised component into the generative process can constrain the model for more discriminative characterization. In this study, we propose an original method based on supervised topic modeling to characterize AD from a generative perspective, yet maintaining discriminative power at differentiating disease populations.

It can take the time that may not be acceptable for many IoT applications and requires resources that may not be available in many IoT devices. A categorisation of these services into their application domains can reduce the search space and offer an efficient and scalable service search. Recently, in many fields, such as short text messages and categorisation of IoT service specifications, generative probabilistic models, like Topic modelling, are being used. Generally, IoT service descriptions are short and sparse. Existing work on IoT services categorisation is based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), but it does not perform well in short and sparse texts. Also, IoT services categorisation has few specific issues, which are not well addressed by existing short texts-specific topic modelling approaches. In this paper, we identify these issues and quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate how well a set of selected short texts-specific topic modelling approaches perform as IoT service categorisers against these issues. The results show that these approaches do not perform well in a corpus of noisy APIs descriptions and heterogeneous service descriptions. Also, they do not support domain identification of services, which is essential in domain-based service search. We conclude that integrating an appropriate and comprehensive knowledge base (i.e., domain ontology) could minimise noise and address IoT's APIs and service descriptions' heterogeneity. More importantly, it can identify the domains of those APIs and services.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3071009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395093","Large-scale IoT;service discovery;service oriented computing;topic modelling","Computational modeling;Ontologies;Probabilistic logic;Internet of Things;Resource management;Noise measurement;Task analysis","application program interfaces;Internet of Things;ontologies (artificial intelligence);probability;text analysis;Web services","IoT service specifications;IoT service descriptions;IoT services categorisation;sparse texts;IoT service categorisers;heterogeneous service descriptions;domain-based service search;multidomain services space;IoT devices;search space;short text messages;generative probabilistic models;latent Dirichlet allocation;LDA;noisy APIs descriptions;domain identification;knowledge base;domain ontology;IoT API;service description heterogeneity;short texts-specific topic modeling","","","","48","CCBY","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To make sense of this textual data, topic modelling is frequently used as a text-mining tool for the discovery of hidden semantic structures in text bodies. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a commonly used topic model that aims to explain the structure of a corpus by grouping texts. LDA requires multiple parameters to work well, and there are only rough and sometimes conflicting guidelines available on how these parameters should be set. In this paper, we contribute (i) a broad study of parameters to arrive at good local optima for GitHub and Stack Overflow text corpora, (ii) an a-posteriori characterisation of text corpora related to eight programming languages, and (iii) an analysis of corpus feature importance via per-corpus LDA configuration. We find that (1) popular rules of thumb for topic modelling parameter configuration are not applicable to the corpora used in our experiments, (2) corpora sampled from GitHub and Stack Overflow have different characteristics and require different configurations to achieve good model fit, and (3) we can predict good configurations for unseen corpora reliably.

Today, it is becoming increasingly important in order to annotate large-scale social media images from content-sharing websites and social networks. These social images are usually annotated by user-provided low-quality tags. The topic model is considered as a promising method to describe these weak-labeling images by learning latent representations of training samples. The recent annotation methods based on topic models have two shortcomings. First, they are difficult to scale to a large-scale image dataset. Second, they can not be used to online image repository because of continuous addition of new images and new tags. In this paper, we propose a novel annotation method based on topic model, namely local learning-based probabilistic latent semantic analysis (LL-PLSA), to solve the above problems. The key idea is to train a weighted topic model for a given test image on its semantic neighborhood consisting of a fixed number of semantically and visually similar images. This method can scale to a large-scale image database, as training samples involved in modeling are a few nearest neighbors rather than the entire database. Moreover, this proposed topic model, online customized for the test image, naturally addresses the issue of continuous addition of new images and new tags in a database. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art especially in terms of overall metrics.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2989200","Liaoning Natural Science Foundation Projects(grant numbers:2019-ZD-0182); Creative Research Talents from Universities of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:LR2016071); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9075224","Automatic image annotation;image retrieval;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;topic model","Training;Semantics;Image annotation;Visualization;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Probabilistic logic","image representation;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);statistical analysis;visual databases","semantically images;visually similar images;large-scale image database;training samples;local semantic space;automatic image annotation;image understanding;large-scale social media images;social networks;social images;user-provided low-quality tags;weak-labeling images;large-scale image dataset;online image repository;annotation method;local learning-based probabilistic latent semantic analysis;weighted topic model","","8","","32","CCBY","21 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Topic models enable one to mine cross-sectional patient comorbidity data (e.g., electronic health records) and construct disease subtypes-each with its own temporally evolving prevalence and co-occurrence of phenotypes-without requiring aligned longitudinal phenotype data for all patients. However, the dimensionality of topic models makes interpretation challenging, and de facto analyses provide little intuition regarding phenotype relevance or phenotype interrelationships. PhenoLines enables one to compare phenotype prevalence within and across disease subtype topics, thus supporting subtype characterization, a task that involves identifying a proposed subtype's dominant phenotypes, ages of effect, and clinical validity. We contribute a data transformation workflow that employs the Human Phenotype Ontology to hierarchically organize phenotypes and aggregate the evolving probabilities produced by topic models. We introduce a novel measure of phenotype relevance that can be used to simplify the resulting topology. The design of PhenoLines was motivated by formative interviews with machine learning and clinical experts. We describe the collaborative design process, distill high-level tasks, and report on initial evaluations with machine learning experts and a medical domain expert.

Although 4th IR relevant technologies may have positive impacts in many fields, they may also create harmful impacts, just as every previous industrial revolution has. Most studies dealing with the 4th IR have focused on its positive impacts; the present research concentrates on its negative impacts and suggests technological opportunities to hedge against expected risks in the future. To this end, future societal topics are first identified through latent Dirichlet allocation based topic modeling using textual information of futuristic data, which is retrieved from the website, including information on future-related insights. Second, the risk topics related to the future are selected with the help of a weighting score using predefined risk keywords and sentiment analysis. Finally, safe technological opportunities are identified based on textual information derived from patent data related to risk topics with the perspectives on risk analysis that have prior (prediction, prevention) and posterior perspectives (response, recovery). To illustrate technology relevant to the 4th IR, artificial intelligence (AI) is selected. As a result, 36 topics related to future society and six future risk-related topics are suggested that reflects security-relevant properties of AI and three types of threats.

In this paper, we investigate the relationships among time, location and organizer in EBSNs, and propose a Spatial-Temporal Topic Model (STTM) for cold-start event recommendation. STTM can capture user's interests on content and geographical space changing over time, and users have different event and venue topic distributions at different times in STTM.

This paper proposes a multi-task learning framework which jointly learns a sentiment classifier and a topic model by making the word-level latent topic distributions in the topic model to be similar to the word-level attention vectors in sentiment classifiers through mutual learning.

Many theoretical and practical tasks, such as dimensional reduction, document clustering, and link prediction, could benefit from this revealed knowledge. However, existing relational topic models are based on an assumption that the number of hidden topics is known a priori, which is impractical in many real-world applications. Therefore, in order to relax this assumption, we propose a nonparametric relational topic model using stochastic processes instead of fixed-dimensional probability distributions in this paper. Specifically, each document is assigned a Gamma process, which represents the topic interest of this document. Although this method provides an elegant solution, it brings additional challenges when mathematically modeling the inherent network structure of typical document network, i.e., two spatially closer documents tend to have more similar topics. Furthermore, we require that the topics are shared by all the documents. In order to resolve these challenges, we use a subsampling strategy to assign each document a different Gamma process from the global Gamma process, and the subsampling probabilities of documents are assigned with a Markov Random Field constraint that inherits the document network structure. Through the designed posterior inference algorithm, we can discover the hidden topics and its number simultaneously. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world network datasets demonstrate the capabilities of learning the hidden topics and, more importantly, the number of topics.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2016.2636182","Australian Research Council (ARC)(grant numbers:DP140101366); China Scholarship Council; National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61471232); Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology International Cooperation Foundation(grant numbers:16550720400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7775071","Text mining;network analysis;topic model;Bayesian nonparametric","Bayes methods;Data models;Stochastic processes;Indexes;Electronic mail;Probability distribution;Social network services","belief networks;data mining;Markov processes;text analysis","Bayesian nonparametric relational topic model;dependent gamma processes;stochastic processes;fixed-dimensional probability distributions;subsampling strategy;Markov random field;posterior inference algorithm;text mining","","15","","46","IEEE","6 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most existing topic models neglect semantic or syntactic information and lack readable topic descriptions. To exploit semantic and syntactic information, Language Models (LMs) have been applied in many supervised NLP tasks. However, there are still no extensions of LMs for unsupervised topic clustering. Moreover, it is difficult to employ general LMs (e.g., BERT) to produce readable topic summaries due to the mismatch between the pretraining method and the summarization task. In this paper, noticing the similarity between content and summary, first we propose a Language Model-based Topic Model (LMTM) for Topic Clustering by using an LM to generate a deep contextualized word representation. Then, a new method of training a Topic Summarization Model is introduced, where it is not only able to produce brief topic summaries but also used as an LM in LMTM for topic clustering. Empirical evaluations of two different datasets show that the proposed LMTM method achieves better performance over four baselines for JC, FMI, precision, recall and F1-score.

In this scenario, analysis of emergent and widely reported topics/themes/issues and associated sentiments from various countries can help us better understand the COVID-19 pandemic. In our research, the database of more than 100,000 COVID-19 news headlines and articles were analyzed using top2vec (for topic modeling) and RoBERTa (for sentiment classification and analysis). Our topic modeling results highlighted that education, economy, US, and sports are some of the most common and widely reported themes across UK, India, Japan, South Korea.

Uninformative content is mainly based on personal opinions and is more suitable for sentimental analysis. Whereas informative content is based on facts, figures, and reports; therefore, it is beneficial to gain a more in-depth understanding for a better strategic response to COVID-19. Despite knowing this fact, there is still a lack of study performed to investigate the aspects of informative content to gain an in-depth understanding of COVID-19 discussed topics. We aim to fill this gap through the study presented in this paper. We used the dataset containing 4719 “informative” and 5281 “uninformative” labeled tweets to realize informative aspects. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) are popular topic modeling techniques. However, since both are based on an unsupervised approach, it is still unknown whether LDA or LSA effectively categorizes documents and how an appropriate number of topics can be determined. Therefore, we used both techniques to analyze tweets' content. Results show that LDA outperforms LSA by achieving a topic coherence score of 0.619 on uninformative and 0.599 on informative. In addition, based on LDA's results, it is also observed that most of the words that form informative content are death, case, coronavirus, people, confirmed, total, positive, tested, number, reported indicating tested, and death cases are the most concerned topics. On the other hand, words like immunity, fatality, protocol, thread, tourist, queue, blockade, eradication, prediction, detention, concerned are most likely to form uninformative content.","","978-1-6654-2899-6","10.1109/IICAIET51634.2021.9573878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9573878","topic modeling;informative;latent semantic analysis;uninformative;latent dirichlet allocation;machine learning","COVID-19;Analytical models;Protocols;Social networking (online);Pandemics;Semantics;Coherence","data mining;social networking (online);text analysis","identifying informative;uninformative content;COVID-19 tweets;COVID19 pandemic forms informative;general information;informative content;COVID-19 discussed topics;5281 uninformative labeled tweets;informative aspects;popular topic modeling techniques;topic coherence score;concerned topics","","1","","23","","28 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One effective strategy for analyzing acoustic scenes is to characterize them as a combination of acoustic words. An acoustic topic model (ATM) is one of the techniques, which models the process generating multiple acoustic words. Here, an acoustic word corresponds to a sound category, while it has a homogenous time duration and is defined time frame by time frame. In the ATM, it is assumed that all acoustic words are observed, and therefore, it cannot be applied if any acoustic observations are missing. However, acoustic observations may sometimes be missing because of poor recording conditions, transmission loss, or privacy reasons. In the proposed method, focusing on the fact that acoustic words are temporally correlated, we consider the transition of acoustic words in two ways: First, by modeling the temporal transition of acoustic words directly using a Markov process and finally, by modeling the temporal transition of hidden states that generate acoustic words using a hidden Markov model. We then incorporate each transition model in a process generating acoustic words based on the ATM. The proposed method allows us to analyze acoustic scenes from acoustic words by restoring missing acoustic words. In our experiments, the proposed method exhibited a classification accuracy of acoustic scenes close to that for the case of no missing observations even when 50% of the observations were missing. Moreover, the model considering the hidden-state transition can classify acoustic scenes more accurately than the model considering the acoustic word transition directly.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2018.2879855","Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(grant numbers:16H01735); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8526312","Acoustic scene analysis;missing data analysis;Markov model;acoustic topic model","Acoustics;Hidden Markov models;Analytical models;Image analysis;Data models;Speech processing;Privacy","acoustic signal processing;hidden Markov models","acoustic scenes;acoustic topic model;multiple acoustic words;acoustic word corresponds;acoustic observations;missing observations;acoustic word transition;acoustic scene analysis","","7","","34","OAPA","7 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This research can be further improved by incorporating sentiment analysis methods for short texts, classifying emoticons and non-textual components such as videos or images, and optimizing data collection and preparation methods.","2158-3412","978-1-7281-5480-0","10.1109/ISTAS48451.2019.8937859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8937859","Sentiment Analysis;Topic Modeling;Hurricane Irma;County-based analysis;Big Data;Tweet Analytics","Hurricanes;Storms;Sentiment analysis;Analytical models;Coherence;Social networking (online);Time series analysis","emergency management;Internet;sentiment analysis;social networking (online);storms","disaster response;sentiment trends;Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling;natural disasters;sentiment analysis methods;data collection;disaster resilience;geotagged Twitter data;emoticons classification;storm totality;social media attention;Hurricane Irma","","4","","39","","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analytical solutions for Bayesian inference of such models, however, are usually intractable, hindering the proposition of highly expressive text models. In this scenario, Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), where an inference network (the encoder) is used to approximate the posterior distribution, became a promising alternative for inferring latent topic distributions of text documents. These models, however, also pose new challenges such as the requirement of continuous and reparameterizable distributions which may not fit so well the true latent topic distributions. Moreover, inference networks are prone to component collapsing, impairing the collection of coherent topics. To overcome these problems, we propose two new text topic models based on the categorical distribution Gumbel-Softmax (GSDTM) and on mixtures of Logistic-Normal distributions (LMDTM). We also provide a study on the impact of different modeling choices on the generated topics, observing a trade-off between topic coherence and document reconstruction. Through experiments using two reference datasets, we show that GSDTM largely outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines when considering three different evaluation metrics.","2161-4407","978-1-5090-6014-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489778","","Neural networks;Mathematical model;Adaptation models;Data models;Task analysis;Coherence;Standards","Bayes methods;belief networks;natural language processing;normal distribution;text analysis","unlabeled data;text documents;continuous distributions;reparameterizable distributions;text topic models;categorical distribution Gumbel-Softmax;Logistic-Normal distributions;document reconstruction;NLP-related tasks;Bayesian inference network;variational auto-encoders;posterior distribution approximation;topic coherence;probabilistic topic models;latent topic distributions;LMDTM;GSDTM;VAEs;logistic-normal mixture distributions","","3","","22","","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Branch of NLP that deals with it, is automatic text summarizer. Automatic text summarizer does the task of converting the long textual document into short fluent summaries. There are generally two ways of summarizing text using automatic text summarizer, first is using extractive text summarizer and another abstractive text summarizer. This paper has demonstrated an experiment in contrast with the extractive text summarizer for summarizing the text. On the other hand topic modelling is a NLP task that extracts the relevant topic from the textual document. One such method is Latent semantic Analysis (LSA) using truncated SVD which extracts all the relevant topics from the text. This paper has demonstrated the experiment in which the proposed research work will be summarizing the long textual document using LSA topic modelling along with TFIDF keyword extractor for each sentence in a text document and also using BERT encoder model for encoding the sentences from textual document in order to retrieve the positional embedding of topics word vectors.

This paper presents an unsupervised forum understanding model, namely the temporal emotion-topic model (TETM), to model time jointly with emotions and topics. This model is applied to track the evolutionary trends of pairs of {emotion, topic}, i.e., emot-topics. Especially, for each emotion, the most significant topic can be extracted and tracked across a semester. Finally, we investigate the emot-topics differences of different achievement levels of students, and examine the dynamics of emot-topics over course weeks to gain some insights about the relationship between time, emotion and learning achievement. The tracking of emot-topics could be valuable if users are informed of what students are concerned about and how these topics evolve in courses.","2166-0549","978-1-5386-9603-3","10.1109/EITT.2018.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8719452","Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs);discussion forum;topic model;emotion analysis;evolutionary trends","Analytical models;Electronic learning;Psychology;Market research;Probabilistic logic;Discussion forums","computer aided instruction;educational courses;Internet;teaching","blended learning;unsupervised forum understanding model;emot-topics differences;SPOC discussion forums;temporal emotion-topic modeling approach;small private online courses","","1","","8","","23 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the limited length of each short text, word co-occurrence information in this type of documents is sparse. Conventional topic models based on word co-occurrence are unable to distill coherent topics on short texts. A state-of-the-art strategy is self-aggregated topic models which implicitly aggregate short texts into latent long documents. But these models have two problems. One problem is that the number of long documents should be defined explicitly and the inappropriate number leads to poor performance. Another problem is that latent long documents may bring non-semantic word co-occurrence which brings incoherent topics. In this article, we firstly apply the Chinese restaurant process to automatically generate the number of long documents according to the scale of short texts. Then to exclude non-semantic word co-occurrence, we propose a novel probabilistic model generating latent long documents in a more semantically way. Specifically, our model employs a pitman-yor process to aggregate short texts into long documents. This stochastic process can guarantee that the distribution between short texts and long documents following a power-law distribution which can be found in social media like Twitter.

Previous studies have focused on the quantitative aspects of individuals' contribution in collaborative writing, while the quality aspect has received less attention. In this paper, we propose a new model to measure not only quantitative input but also the quality of the content that has been contributed to a document written collaboratively in Spanish language. Based on topics-modeling techniques, we use an adaptive non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model to extract topics from the content of the document, and grade higher students making those contributions. Using Google documents submitted by students to the academic system of our university as part of their projects, experimental results show that compared to other baseline methods such as edits or words count, our model provide a better approximation to the scores given by human reviewers. Therefore, our model can be used as part of an automatic grading subsystem within the academic system, to provide a baseline score of students' contribution in collaborative documents.

However, there are no explicit constraints for the training of embeddings, leading to a larger optimization space. Also, a clear description of the changes in embeddings and the impact on model performance is still lacking. In this paper, we propose an embedding regularized neural topic model, which applies the specially designed training constraints on word embedding and topic embedding to reduce the optimization space of parameters. To reveal the changes and roles of embeddings, we introduce uniformity into the embedding-based neural topic model as the evaluation metric of embedding space. On this basis, we describe how embeddings tend to change during training via the changes in the uniformity of embeddings. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of changes in embeddings in embedding-based neural topic models through ablation studies. The results of experiments on two mainstream datasets indicate that our model significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of the harmony between topic quality and document modeling.

Extracting useful themes from a large article corpus manually is infeasible, text mining techniques such as topic modelling provide a mechanism to automatically infer themes from a corpus of text. Exploring the coverage of a single election period uncovers topical discourse that is relevant to current affairs in that election period. Analysing two consecutive election periods allows one to analyse the evolution of discourse from one period to another. Articles published by News24 were sourced to conduct the analysis and answer the research questions set forth. The articles were cleaned and topic models were built to identify 20 latent topics. The articles are classified with their topic before a pairwise cosine similarity comparison is applied on topic corpora to identify similar topics between election periods. The results of this study provide important insights relating to the two election periods, some of these include: coverage of corruption- related content is consistent between the two election periods and most political-themed articles in this corpus address problematic themes.","2640-0146","978-1-7281-4577-8","10.1109/ISCMI47871.2019.9004342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9004342","natural language processing;elections;topic modelling;cosine similarity","Text mining;Natural language processing;Semantics;Information retrieval;Text analysis","data mining;information resources;information retrieval;pattern classification;politics;text analysis","topic modelling;corruption-related content;pairwise cosine similarity;News24 articles;current affairs;text mining;election discourse information;South Africa;topical discourse;news articles;political-themed articles","","1","","10","","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the modern automatic image annotation methods are based on the learning by example paradigm. In those methods building the training examples, that is, pairs of images and related tags, is the first critical step. We have shown in our previous studies that hashtags accompanying images in social media and especially the Instagram provide a reach source for creating training sets for AIA. However, we concluded that only 20% of the Instagram hashtags describe the actual content of the image they accompany, thus, a series of filtering steps need to apply in order to identify the appropriate hashtags. In this paper we apply graph based topic modelling on Instagram hashtags in order to predict the subject of the related images and we propose an innovative image retrieval scheme that can be used in the context of Instagram with minimal training requirements.","","978-1-7281-5919-5","10.1109/SMAP49528.2020.9248465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9248465","Topic modelling;Instagram hashtags;automatic image annotation;learning by example;image retrieval","Training;Adaptation models;Social networking (online);Multimedia Web sites;Image retrieval;Semantics;Image annotation","graph theory;image annotation;image retrieval;learning by example;social networking (online)","topic modelling;Instagram hashtags;AIA;digital images;automatic image annotation methods;graph based topic;innovative image retrieval scheme;minimal training requirements;social media;learning by example paradigm","","1","","27","","9 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we conducted research on how product review classification can assist in resolving the issue of comments on incorrect items. The method used in this research consists of 4 steps which are, data acquisition, data pre-processing, topic modeling, and text classification. Where Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used as our topic modeling technique, and for text classification we used Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers. We found out that by combining both topic modeling and text classification, a powerful tool for handling this kind of problem was developed. Adding the topic modeling can improve the model's accuracy performance from 0.61 to 0.78.

Most of these techniques suffer from two main drawbacks. First, they model the mortality prediction problem as a binary classification problem, while ignoring the time of death as continuous values. Second, they use topic models to analyze the notes, while ignoring the relationship between measurements, notes and mortality/discharge outcomes. In this paper we propose a novel model called the survival topic model (SVTM), which models patients' measurements, notes and mortality/discharge jointly, and predicts the probability of mortality/discharge as functions of time. The idea is that each patient has a latent distribution of disease conditions, which we call topics. These conditions generate the measurements and notes and determine the patients' mortality. We derive a mean-field variational inference algorithm for this model. We fitted the SVTM with two outcomes on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) trauma patients data and obtained some important topics.

To this end, we propose a novel topic model named Semantic-based Bidirectional Adversarial Neural Topic Model (SNTM), which introduces semantic information into Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGAN) by adding the word embedding and BiLSTM-Attention mechanism. This improvement makes the encoder network in our model generate a distribution closer to the real document-topic distribution.

In our model, ES-LDAext, which is the extended version of our previous model, we utilize the word embedding to supplement the RDF data before applying entity summarization. In addition, in the model presented here, we use RDF literals as a very good source of information to create more reliable and representative summaries for entities. To do that, we use the Named Entity Recognition approach to extract entities within literals before feeding them into the word embedding model to enrich the RDF data.

It is very useful to simplify the management of a large volume of textual data by assigning each text to one or more categories. This operation is challenging when it is a multi-label classification. For Arabic text, this task becomes more challenging due to the complex morphology and structure of Arabic language. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a classification system for the Mowjaz Multi-Topic Labelling Task. The objective of this task is to classify Arabic articles according to the 10 topics predefined in Mowjaz. The proposed system is based on AraBERT, a pre-trained BERT model for the Arabic language. The first step of this system consists in tokenizing and representing the input articles using the AraBERT model. Then, a fully connected neural network is applied on the output of the AraBERT model to classify the articles according to their topics. The experimental tests conducted on the Mowjaz dataset showed an accuracy of 0.865 for the development set and an accuracy of 0.851 for the test set.","2573-3346","978-1-6654-3351-8","10.1109/ICICS52457.2021.9464540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9464540","Arabic text classification;Multi-label classification;AraBERT","Communication systems;Text categorization;Neural networks;Bit error rate;Morphology;Labeling;Task analysis","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;text analysis","multitopic labeling;Arabic content;natural language processing;textual data;multilabel classification;Arabic text;Arabic language;Mowjaz multitopic labelling task;Arabic articles;pretrained BERT model;AraBERT model;Mowjaz dataset;BERT-based system","","3","","8","","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, the Indian buffet process provides the BNP prior on a binary matrix for an infinite latent feature model consisting of a flat layer of topics. The nested model paves an avenue to construct a tree model instead of a flat-layer model. This paper presents the nested Indian buffet process (nIBP) to achieve the sparsity and flexibility in topic model where the model complexity and topic hierarchy are learned from the groups of words. The mixed membership modeling is conducted by representing a document using the tree nodes or dishes that a document or a customer chooses according to the nIBP scenario. A tree stick-breaking process is implemented to select topic weights from a subtree for flexible topic modeling. Such an nIBP relaxes the constraint of adopting a single tree path in the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP) and, therefore, improves the variety of topic representation for heterogeneous documents. A Gibbs sampling procedure is developed to infer the nIBP topic model. Compared to the nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nhDP), the compactness of the estimated topics in a tree using nIBP is improved. Experimental results show that the proposed nIBP reduces the error rate of nCRP and nhDP by 18% and 8% on Reuters task for document classification, respectively.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2017.2779862","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 103-2221-E-009-078-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8141927","Topic model;Bayesian nonparametrics (BNPs);hierarchical model;sparse model;text mining","Data models;Atomic measurements;Bayes methods;Mixture models;Feature extraction;Speech;Speech processing","Bayes methods;catering industry;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;natural language processing;nonparametric statistics;text analysis;trees (mathematics)","Bayesian nonparametric learning;BNP;hierarchical topics;sparse topics;infinite latent feature model;tree model;flat-layer model;nested Indian buffet process;model complexity;topic hierarchy;mixed membership modeling;tree nodes;tree stick-breaking process;topic weights;flexible topic modeling;single tree path;nested Chinese restaurant process;topic representation;nIBP topic model;nested hierarchical Dirichlet process","","8","","36","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These were collected through Malasakit, an e-participation platform designed by University of California, Berkeley and National University (Philippines) to engage community participation in gathering qualitative and quantitative data. Analyses were conducted through biterm topic modeling (BTM) and word embedding using gensim. For better accuracy, data preprocessing was performed to remove irrelevant or noisy data. Based on the BTM result, we identified the following important codes: preparedness, disaster, awareness, community, help, seminars, kanal (canal), linisin (clean), drainage, garbage, basura (garbage). Analyses of the topic models show that disaster preparedness is an integral part in disaster risk reduction by improving solid waste management, providing seminars for public awareness and evacuation preparation. A word intrusion test was conducted where BTM scored 55.71% which implies strong cohesion of the words with their topics. For word embedding, we drilled down on the following words: community, preparedness, emergency, barangay (village), help, kanal (drainage), basura (garbage), awareness, seminars, information. The word2vec results has a cosine similarity score of 0.902 which implies strong relatedness of each word.

This paper proposes a supervised text sentiment classification method with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to improve the classification performance of review text with fuzzy sentiment boundaries. Taking the review text of crowdsourcing participants on the Zhubajie platform as the data set, using N-gram, Word2vec, and TF-IDF algorithms to extract text features. The LDA topic model is applied to expand the number of text features and extract eight topics that affect employers’ sentiment tendencies. Text classifiers are constructed based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GDBT), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms, and the effectiveness of the sentiment classification methods are verified by ten-fold cross-validation and confusion matrix. Experimental results show that using the LDA topic model to extend the features of review text can effectively alleviate the problem that the classifier is difficult to distinguish the sentiment categories of different emotion polarity words coexisting text, and enhance the ability of emotion boundary fuzzy text classification. Based on TF-IDF and LDA to extract and expand text features, the GBDT text sentiment classifier with the accuracy of 0.881; the F1-measure of the second, third, fourth, and fifth categories samples are 0.462, 0.571, 0.278, and 0.647 respectively, which is better than SVM, RF, and XGBoost classifiers and has the best classification performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3101565","Scientific Research Projects of Zhejiang Education Department(grant numbers:Y202045307); Jiangxi Social Science Fund Project(grant numbers:19GL25); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61806204); Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:19YJA630123); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9502605","Sentiment analysis;text classification;LDA topic model;crowdsourcing participants","Crowdsourcing;Feature extraction;Dictionaries;Support vector machines;Sentiment analysis;Classification algorithms;Text categorization","decision trees;natural language processing;pattern classification;support vector machines;text analysis;Web sites","GBDT text sentiment classifier;emotion boundary fuzzy text classification;sentiment classification methods;text classifiers;LDA topic model;text features;classification performance;supervised text sentiment classification method;review text;crowdsourcing participants","","","","26","CCBY","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Twitter is popular for its micro-blogging service, as it has millions of active users interacting through it. Using the Twitter stream for natural disasters detection is a quick and useful detection method for SOS, TV News and disaster relief organization. However, a tweets text is unstructured, sparse, has no exact defined schema and may contain a lot of noise. In addition, after the latest Twitter update, historical data longer than 14 days is no longer accessible which limits the effectiveness of supervised learning techniques. This paper discusses results of using the Latent Dircherilet Allocation LDA topic modelling technique to detect tweets related to the 2011 Japan Tsunami. A training set of 6700 tweets and a test set of 196 tweets were filtered from a total set of collected 700,000 tweets. Accuracy results achieved was 76% using 10-fold cross validation. To evaluate how well the model fits the documents, the perplexity statistical function is compared for different values of K. Starting at K > 1 and K <; 10 resulted in having K = 2 with the lowest perplexity of 7.5125 for training data and 60.594 for testing data. The gap between the training and testing data means that as the training data increases, the perplexity decreases and the accuracy of detection will improve. Eliminating model over fitting and creating a more generative model will positively influence the accuracy level of the prediction.","","978-1-5386-2085-4","10.1109/EECS.2017.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8412033","LDA;micro blogging;Twitter;topic modeling;machine learning;latent;Dircherilet;Allocation","Twitter;Data mining;Tsunami;Data models;Training;Feature extraction;Computer science","disasters;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);tsunami","topic modelling;microblogging service;social media users;opinions;Twitter stream;quick detection method;useful detection method;disaster relief organization;tweets text;exact defined schema;historical data;supervised learning techniques;Latent Dircherilet Allocation;2011 Japan Tsunami;training set;test set;collected 700 tweets;000 tweets;10-fold cross validation;perplexity statistical function;testing data;generative model;natural disasters detection;Twitter update","","5","","25","","19 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The investigated combinations are compared with state-of-the-art approaches applied on the same data. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of both the meaning and the order of the word on topic modeling. This has often been overlooked in previous work as neither were taken into consideration where in some others only one was taken.

Whenever it detects an anomaly situation, it generates a bug report and sends it to the software developer or maintenance center. However, the newly reported bug can be an already existing issue that was reported earlier and may have a solution in the master report repository. This condition brings an avalanche of duplicate bug reports, posing a big challenge to the software development life cycle. Thus, early detection of duplicate bug reports has become an extremely important task in the software industry. To address this issue, this work proposes a double-tier approach using clustering and classification, whereby it exploits Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic-based clustering, multimodal text representation using Word2Vec (W2V), FastText (FT) and Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe), and a unified text similarity measure using Cosine and Euclidean metrics. The proposed model is tested on the Eclipse dataset consisting over 80,000 bug reports, which is the amalgamation of both master and duplicate reports. This work considers only the description of the reports for detecting duplicates. The experimental results show that the proposed two-tier model achieves a recall rate of 67% for Top-N recommendations with 3 times faster computation than the conventional one-on-one classification model.","2577-1655","978-1-7281-8526-2","10.1109/SMC42975.2020.9283289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283289","Bug report detection;topic modeling;information retrieval;natural language processing;machine learning","Computational modeling;Operating systems;Computer bugs;Software;Resource management;Task analysis;Monitoring","document handling;pattern classification;program debugging;software maintenance;text analysis;word processing","duplicate bug reports;software developer;software development life cycle;LDA-based topic modeling;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;topic-based clustering;multimodal text representation;Word2Vec;Top-N recommendations;classification model;operating system;bug tracking system;W2V;FastText;Global Vectors;text similarity measure;Euclidean metrics","","1","","20","","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The straightforward solution of this matter can be managed by using a feature selection method capable of reducing the features space effectively. This work describes how to utilize the supervised topic model Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation for feature selection, as well accelerating AdaBoost.MH learning for multi-label text categorization.

Service clustering technology can narrow the retrieval range of service discovery and improve the efficiency of service discovery. However, due to the short text features with few words and difficult feature extraction in service description text, the traditional text clustering model can not get effective clusters. In this paper, a web service clustering method based on word vector and BTM (Biterm Topic Model) is proposed. Firstly, the sparse feature problem of short text is alleviated by expanding the word vector. Secondly, the extended service description text is modeled by the BTM based on Gibbs sampling. Finally, the k-means algorithm is used to cluster web services. Compared with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and BTM, this method improves the F-Measure of clustering index.

Motivated by the intuitive assumption that different words have varying degrees of discriminative power in delivering the objective sense or the subjective sense with respect to their assigned topics, a model named as discriminatively objective-subjective LDA (dosLDA) is proposed in this paper. The essential idea underlying the proposed dosLDA is that a pair of objective and subjective selection variables are explicitly employed to encode the interplay between topics and discriminative power for the words in documents in a supervised manner. As a result, each document is appropriately represented as “bag-of-discriminativewords” (BoDW). The experiments reported on documents and images demonstrate that dosLDA not only performs competitively over traditional approaches in terms of topic modeling and document classification, but also has the ability to discern the discriminative power of each word in terms of its objective or subjective sense with respect to its assigned topic.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2017.2658571","National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2015CB352300); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U1611461,61572431,61672456); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation (ZJNSF)(grant numbers:LZ17F020001); China Knowledge Centre for Engineering Sciences and Technology; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7833066","Topic modeling;latent Dirichlet allocation;objective and subjective classification;bag-of-discriminative-words representation","Computational modeling;Visualization;Data models;Analytical models;Vocabulary;Semantics;Bayes methods","document handling;pattern classification;statistical analysis","bag-of-discriminative-words representation;BoDW representation;topic modeling;order Hemiptera;degrees-of-discriminative power variation;objective-subjective LDA;latent Dirichlet allocation;objective-subjective latent Dirichlet allocation;objective selection variables;subjective selection variables;document classification","","10","","53","IEEE","25 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to address the novel recommendation issue, this paper proposes a semi-supervised novel recommendation algorithm with tag-topic model. In the paper, we build a tag list set, finds sample data containing test data tag elements in the sample set, and performs topic model training on the text content of the sample data to obtain the topic distribution vector.

However, there are two problems that may affect their applications. One is that common words shared among all documents with low representational meaning may reduce the representation ability of learned topics. The other is introducing supervision information to hierarchical topic models to fully utilize the side information of documents that is difficult. To address these problems, in this article, we first propose deep diverse latent Dirichlet allocation (DDLDA), a deep hierarchical topic model that can yield more meaningful semantic topics with less common and meaningless words by introducing shared topics. Moreover, we develop a variational inference network for DDLDA, which helps us to further generalize DDLDA to a supervised deep topic model called max-margin DDLDA (mmDDLDA) by employing max-margin principle as the classification criterion. Compared to DDLDA, mmDDLDA can discover more discriminative topical representations. In addition, a continual hybrid method with stochastic-gradient MCMC and variational inference is put forward for deep latent Dirichlet allocation (DLDA)-based models to make them more practical in real-world applications. The experimental results demonstrate that DDLDA and mmDDLDA are more efficient than existing unsupervised and supervised topic models in discovering highly discriminative topic representations and achieving higher classification accuracy. Meanwhile, DLDA and our proposed models trained by the proposed continual learning approach cannot only show good performance on preventing catastrophic forgetting but also fit the evolving new tasks well.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2020.3044915","Program for Young Thousand Talent by Chinese Central Government; Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:B18039); NSFC(grant numbers:61771361); NSFC for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:61525105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9380180","Continual learning;deep latent Dirichlet allocation (DLDA);deep supervised topic model;max-margin principle;Weibull variational encoder (WVE)","Probabilistic logic;Nonhomogeneous media;Task analysis;Semantics;Resource management;Data models;Computational modeling","image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;unsupervised learning","max-margin deep diverse latent Dirichlet allocation;probabilistic aspect models;document analysis;semantic information;descriptive topics;common words;low representational meaning;representation ability;learned topics;supervision information;hierarchical topic models;deep hierarchical topic model;meaningful semantic topics;meaningless words;shared topics;variational inference network;supervised deep topic model;max-margin DDLDA;mmDDLDA;max-margin principle;discriminative topical representations;continual hybrid method;deep latent Dirichlet allocation-based models;unsupervised topic models;highly discriminative topic representations;achieving higher classification accuracy;continual learning approach","Models, Statistical;Semantics","","","59","IEEE","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most of the modern automatic image annotation methods are based on the learning by example paradigm. In those methods building the training examples, that is, pairs of images and related tags, is the first critical step. We have shown in our previous studies that hashtags accompanying images in social media and especially the Instagram provide a reach source for creating training sets for AIA. However, we concluded that only 20% of the Instagram hashtags describe the actual content of the image they accompany, thus, a series of filtering steps need to apply in order to identify the appropriate hashtags. In this paper we apply topic modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on Instagram hashtags in order to predict the subject of the related images. Since a topic is composed by a set of related terms, the identification of the visual topic of an Instagram image, through the proposed method, provides a plausible set of tags to be used in the context of training AIA methods.","","978-1-5386-8225-8","10.1109/SMAP.2018.8501887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8501887","Topic modelling;Instagram hashtags;automatic image annotation;learning by example","Twitter;Tagging;Training;Visualization;Analytical models;Data models;Image annotation","image annotation;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online)","digital images;topic modelling;Instagram image;AIA methods;automatic image annotation methods;Instagram hashtags;social media;Latent Dirichlet Allocation","","10","","23","","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given a text collection, Gibbs MedLDA generates topics as a summary of the text collection. We design a scatter plot to display documents and topics simultaneously to show the topic information, and this helps users explore the text collection structurally and find labels for creating. After labeling documents, Gibbs MedLDA is applied to the text collection with labels again, and it generates both the topic and classification information. We also provide a scatter plot with the classifier boundary and a matrix view to present weights of classifiers. Users can iteratively label documents to refine each classifier.

We expanded the uncertainty term list by applying topic model Word2Vec to identify similar terms to original uncertainty ontologies. The teaching files were quantified into 5 uncertainty level classes by the sum of the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) of the expanded uncertainty terms list. Results from topic modelling were used to produce features. The product of TF-IDF results of uncertainty terms in teaching files and the topic model results were then used to train classifiers to predict the uncertainty level in medical reports. Our exhaustive experimental analysis showed that Decision Tree can classify uncertainty level of medical reports at overall accuracy 82%, which is higher than K-nearest Neighbor (80%) and Naive Bayes (75%).

To focus on specific subsets of large document corpora, a user may specify various criteria to identify documents of interest before extracting topics from the documents. In this paper, we aim to accelerate the computation of topic models for documents that satisfy range queries. Our strategy is to create indexes for identifying documents, and pre-compute the topic models for certain subsets of documents. The indexes enable to efficiently identify the exact set (called the Canonical Set) of documents that fall within the user-specified range. The target topic model is computed by combining the pre-computed models associated with the Canonical Set of documents. In contrast, the best known approach based on Octrees only allows identifying an estimated set of documents in relation to user's query. Because of the inexact identification of the document sets, the existing approach does not offer an effective error bound on the resulting model. Moreover, for a collection of n d-dimensional documents, the Octree approach requires O(n1-1/d) time in the worst case to search for the relevant documents, whereas our new approach guarantees to find the exact set in O(lgdn) time in the worst case. Because the new approach can identify the exact set of documents and the right pre-trained topic models to combine, it offers a much improved solution. The new scheme can also be parallelized with ease, including the building of the indexes, the pre-computing of the topic models, and the query processing.","","978-1-5386-3408-0","10.1109/IPDPSW.2017.113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7965215","probabilistic topic model;social media;spatiotemporal documents;range queries;range trees;parallel processing for social media","Computational modeling;Octrees;Data models;Indexes;Semantics;Data mining;Pipelines","computational complexity;octrees;query processing;text analysis","topic exploration acceleration;multidimensional documents;multidimensional text data;topic modelling;unstructured document set learning;document identification;document topic extraction;topic model computation acceleration;range queries;document canonical set;user-specified range;octrees;user query;document set identification;d-dimensional documents;pretrained topic models;query processing","","","","50","","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our analysis of the programs is static in the sense that the contents of the said programs are looked at and their representations are constructed without executing the programs. More precisely, assembly language opcodes are extracted from the programs in the dataset and concatenated in order to construct documents representing these programs. Opcodes being words, we then employ Natural Language Processing tools and techniques for analysis of the documents. Mainly, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm is used to model documents as weighted mixtures of a fixed number of topics. A topic is a collection of words grouped together for their ability to capture meaningful attributes about the documents. We note that the weight distribution of topics within documents of the same family (visually) shows a common pattern that seemingly varies from one family to another. This, therefore, aids in justifying the use of the LDA technique as a feature extraction method, with the features here being the weights of the topics representing each and every document.

These methods require feature engineering by hand, which will construct features of limited expressiveness. To overcome these methods' shortcomings, we introduced a deep learning topic model called document neural autoregressive distribution estimation (DocNADE) into urban functional regions mining.

In these systems, recognizing relevant source files among a large number of source files for a given bug report is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task for software developers. To tackle this problem, information retrieval methods have been widely used to capture either the textual similarities or the semantic similarities between bug reports and source files. However, these two types of similarities are usually considered separately and the historical bug fixings are largely ignored by the existing methods. In this paper, we propose a supervised topic modeling method (STMLOCATOR) for automatically locating the relevant source files for a given bug report. In particular, the proposed model is built upon three key observations. First, supervised modeling can effectively make use of the existing fixing histories. Second, certain words in bug reports tend to appear multiple times in their relevant source files. Third, longer source files tend to have more bugs. By integrating the above three observations, the proposed STMLOCATOR utilizes historical fixings in a supervised way and learns both the textual similarities and semantic similarities between bug reports and source files. We further consider a special type of bug reports with stack-traces in bug reports, and propose a variant of STMLOCATOR to tailor for such bug reports. Experimental evaluations on three real data sets demonstrate that the proposed STMLOCATOR can achieve up to 23.6% improvement in terms of prediction accuracy over its best competitors, and scales linearly with the size of the data. Moreover, the proposed variant further improves STMLOCATOR by up to 76.2% on those bug reports with stack-traces.","2374-8486","978-1-5386-9159-5","10.1109/ICDM.2018.00076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8594885","Bug Localization;Bug Report;Supervised topic modeling","Computer bugs;Semantics;Software;History;Maintenance engineering;Correlation;Data mining","information retrieval;program debugging;software engineering;supervised learning","historical bug fixings;bug tracking systems;source files;supervised topic modeling;software bugs report;labor-intensive task;software developer;information retrieval method;textual similarity;semantic similarity;STMLOCATOR","","4","","34","","30 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, how to discover the topics of streaming short texts has become an important task for many content analysis applications. Conventional topic models such as Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) will suffer from sparsity problem when we infer the latent topics from short texts with them. The reason is that they derive topics from document-level word co-occurrence by modeling each document as a mixture of topics. Different from the above idea, Biterm Topic Model (BTM) discovers topics in short texts by directly modeling the generation of word co-occurrence patterns in the whole corpus. But semantic information is lacking for short texts. In this paper, in order to alleviate the sparsity problem, keep the semantic information of documents and get the latent topic information of streaming short texts immediately, we propose a joint topic model for Chinese streaming short texts (CTM) based on the online algorithms of LDA and BTM. Experiments on short texts from Sina Weibo show that our joint topic model can discover more precise topics and carry out more applications. In addition, considering the preprocessing in Chinese text is different from English and errors in extracting key phrases, we use a combined word method to extend the length of short texts and reduce errors in extracting key phrases.","2161-4407","978-1-5090-6014-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489770","streaming chinese short texts;topic discovery;topic models;online algorithms","Semantics;Tagging;Task analysis;Twitter;Analytical models;Probabilistic logic","data mining;inference mechanisms;natural language processing;probability;social networking (online);text analysis","latent topic information;joint topic model;Chinese streaming short texts;Sina Weibo;key phrases;PLSA;BTM;LDA;semantic information;document-level word co-occurrence;sparsity problem;latent Dirichlet allocation;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;content analysis applications;social media;CTM;Web;topic discovery;biterm topic model","","1","","26","IEEE","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers' coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants' reflections. In one section of an undergraduate Introduction to Educational Technology course offered at a large university in Western Canada, n = 139 pre-service teachers wrote a short reflection on their experience following a 20 h Accelerated Intro to Computer Science Code.org course. Topics were identified by analyzing contextual trends in participants' written reflections.

To be specific, the topics of text features (i.e., a concrete description of documents) and the topics of label sets (i.e., a summarization of documents) can be obtained from training data by topic model before building models for multi-label classification. After that, hybrid topics can be used in existing approaches to improve the performance of MLTC. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework is general and effective when taking text features and label sets into consideration simultaneously.

To solve these problems, we propose EntityLDA, a topic model which jointly models structured and unstructured parts of KG in order to get complete descriptions of entities. It also bridges the vocabulary gap between users and KG by connecting related words with shared topics. We further propose a retrieval solution based on EntityLDA to retrieve entities under different circumstances. Experimental results show that EntityLDA outperforms baselines in both quantity and quality.","","978-1-7281-8156-1","10.1109/ICBK50248.2020.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9194463","Knowledge Graph;entity retrieval;topic model","Conferences","graph theory;query processing;text analysis","EntityLDA;topic model;knowledge graph;encoding great;popular data source;information retrieval;entity retrieval task;structured triples;unstructured texts;unified form;vocabulary gap;unstructured parts;shared topics;retrieval solution;online KG","","","","13","","11 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developing and creating recommendation models are important and hot issues in EBSNs in recent years, such as event recommendation to users. Although several recommendation models have been proposed, event attendees recommendation models are not fully studied. In this paper, we study the event attendees recommendation problem through empirical experiments. Because of the nature of new events and severe data sparsity in EBSNs, traditional recommender systems work less efficiently for event attendees recommendation problem. To solve this problem, we propose a new location-based topic model that is based on scores of users computed from three major factors extracted from previously attended events, namely content, location and time. The proposed model includes two phases. The first phase uses the topic modeling Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Jensen Shannon divergence to compute the similarity of events based on their contents. The spatial and temporal factors are also calculated. The scores of previous events with an upcoming event are computed from a combination of these three factors. Previous events with high scores are selected, then users who are extracted from the selected events are scored by temporal factors of these events in the second phase. Finally, we recommend users with top scores to the upcoming event. A series of experiments were conducted on real data collected from Meetup Event and the results have demonstrated the improvement of our model over baseline methods.","2162-786X","978-1-5386-9313-1","10.1109/RIVF.2019.8713716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8713716","Social Networks;EBSNs;Recommendation Systems;LDA","Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Resource management;Twitter;Sampling methods;Recommender systems","location based services;recommender systems;social networking (online);statistical distributions","event attendees recommendation problem;new location-based topic model;EBSNs;event attendees recommendation models;event-based social networks;meetup event;topic modeling Latent Dirichlet Allocation;LDA;Jensen Shannon divergence","","3","","14","","16 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The knowledge learned through past experience is utilized to produce better results for future datasets. Generally the learning procedure consists of an evaluation criterion that measures the confidence in a rule and a threshold that provides the par value. The existing LML based topic models learn rules with measures of co-occurrence from statistics which limits it to learning syntagmatic rules only. However, rules consisting of paradigmatic words are ignored as they do not co-occur. They are usually word synonyms and are alternately used. The proposed ParaSyn-LMLTM model learns paradigmatic rules as well while improving syntagmatic rules with techniques from linguistics.

It uses a statistical model, most commonly Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to discover abstract topics that occur in the document collection. However, the LDA-based topic modeling procedure is based on a randomly selected initial configuration as well as a number of parameter values than need to be chosen. This induces uncertainties on the topic modeling results, and visualization methods should convey these uncertainties during the analysis process. We propose a visual uncertainty-aware topic modeling analysis. We capture the uncertainty by computing topic modeling ensembles and propose measures for estimating topic modeling uncertainty from the ensemble. Then, we propose to enhance state-of-the-art topic modeling visualization methods to convey the uncertainty in the topic modeling process. We visualize the entire ensemble of topic modeling results at different levels for topic and document analysis.

Topics in a topic model generated from a user’s documents can be used to represent the user’s information interest. However, the quality of a topic model generated from a document collection is not always accurate because the topics of the topic model might contain meaningless or ambiguous words. This ambiguity problem can affect the performance of IFs which use a topic model to represent user information interest. Hence, a topic evaluation method to assess the quality of topics in a topic model is important for ensuring the effectiveness of utilizing the topic model in text mining applications. One method in measuring the quality of a topic model is to match the topical words of the model to concepts in an ontology. However, a limitation of this method is that some topical words in an examined topic cannot be found in the mapping ontology. In this study, we propose a new model to evaluate the quality of topics by matching concepts in an ontology. In particular, word embedding technique is applied to dealing with the ambiguity problem by finding similar concept words based on word embeddings. The assessed topics are then used in an information filtering system for filtering relevant documents for a user. The proposed model was evaluated against some state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of term-based, phrase-based, and topic-based user interest representations, and also some topic evaluation models.

The interest in efficiently solving these image and video applications has led researchers to develop methods to expertly drive the corresponding processing to conspicuous regions that either depend on the context or are based on specific requirements. In this paper, we propose a general hierarchical probabilistic framework, independent of the application scenario, and relied on the most outstanding psychological studies about attention and eye movements which support that guidance is not based directly on the information provided by early visual processes but on a contextual representation that arose from them. The approach defines the task of context-driven visual attention as a mixture of latent sub-tasks, which are, in turn, modeled as a combination of specific distributions associated to low-, mid-, and high-level spatio-temporal features. Learning from fixations gathered from human observers, we incorporate an intermediate level between feature extraction and visual attention estimation that enables to obtain comprehensively guiding representations. The experiments show how our proposal successfully learns particularly adapted hierarchical explanations of visual attention in diverse video genres, outperforming several leading models in the literature.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2019.2909427","Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports FPU(grant numbers:FPU13/04904); National Grants(grant numbers:TEC2014-53390-P,TEC2014-61729-EXP,TEC2017-84395-P); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8681393","Top-down visual attention;hierarchical probabilistic framework;context-aware model;latent topic models","Visualization;Task analysis;Adaptation models;Feature extraction;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic;Context modeling","computer vision;feature extraction;probability;psychology;video signal processing","psychological studies;eye movements;contextual representation;high-level spatio-temporal features;visual attention estimation;probabilistic topic model;context-driven visual attention understanding;visual data;video applications;hierarchical probabilistic framework;modern computer vision","","2","","59","IEEE","4 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The future topics should mimic past topics of interest yet there should be some novelty in them. We develop a keyword-based topic model that dynamically selects a subset of keywords to be used to collect future documents. The generative process first selects keywords and then the underlying documents based on the specified keywords. The model is trained by using a variational lower bound and stochastic gradient optimization. The inference consists of finding a subset of keywords where given a subset the model predicts the underlying topic-word matrix for the unknown forthcoming documents. We compare the keyword topic model against a benchmark model using viral predictions of tweets combined with a topic model.

In response, this paper suggests an approach to identify product opportunities from customer reviews in social media. This approach employs topic modeling to identify the product topics discussed by customers from largescale review posts related to a given product. A keygraph is then constructed based on the co-occurrences among the topics contained in each post.

Existing recommendation methods, however, typically focus on predicting missing rating values via analyzing user-item dualistic relationship, which neglect an important fact that the latent interests of users can influence their rating behaviors. Moreover, traditional recommendation methods easily suffer from the high dimensional problem and cold-start problem. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a PBUED (PLSA-Based Uniform Euclidean Distance) scheme, which utilizes topic model and uniform Euclidean distance to recommend the suitable items for users. The solution first employs probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) to extract users' interests, users with different interests are divided into different subgroups. Then, the uniform Euclidean distance is adopted to compute the users' similarity in the same interest subset; finally, the missing rating values of data are predicted via aggregating similar neighbors' ratings. We evaluate PBUED on two datasets and experimental results show PBUED can lead to better predicting performance and ranking performance than other approaches.","1673-5447","","10.1109/CC.2017.8233650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8233650","recommendation system;topic model;user interest;uniform euclidean distance","Euclidean distance;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Probabilistic logic;Matrix decomposition;Feature extraction;Maximum likelihood estimation","Big Data;collaborative filtering;probability;recommender systems","topic model integrated uniform euclidean distance;recommendation system;user-item dualistic relationship;cold-start problem;PLSA-Based Uniform Euclidean Distance;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;big data","","7","","","","22 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Besides, since users are the target of the music market, it is also important to show their relationships within and their connections with songs. Showing songs and users by knowledge maps based on data including both music and user sides will be useful for analyzing songs, users as well as the whole music market. To achieve this goal, we extract effective representations of songs and users by applying a probabilistic topic model to the real-world user-song-listening records and generate knowledge maps for songs and users. Moreover, we propose a way of matching two maps together to show the connection between both.

In this paper, we focus on the binning problem, which is to group reads into clusters that highly represent a taxonomic group. The result of this step serves as a crucial input for the next one of a metagenomic project such as assembly and annotation. Because metagenomic reads does not have explicit features, it is not easy to divide them into distinct groups. The solutions for this binning problem can be categorized as supervised and unsupervised approaches. Supervised ones need a reference database, which is unfortunately about 1% of the microorganisms in nature. This prevents these approaches from working well with the dataset that contain unknown species. In this paper we follow an unsupervised approach. Our proposed method is to combine the result from another technique named BiMeta, which based on a biological signature assumption that reads of a same taxonomic label have a same k-mer distribution, and topic modelling as a way of reducing the dimensions of the dataset. Our method shows better results (by precision, recall, and F-measure) than BiMeta on most datasets. Although following BiMeta, LDABiMeta out- performs it with the new proposed ideas. Moreover, our method is equiv- alent to MetaProb, which is the most successful method at present time, for the short-read datasets.","","978-1-7281-9982-5","10.1109/GTSD50082.2020.9303095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9303095","Metagenomic binning;topic modelling;short reads.","Urban areas;DNA;Genomics;Sustainable development;Natural language processing;Databases;Computer science","biology computing;genomics;microorganisms;pattern clustering","novel binning algorithm;topic modelling;k-mer frequency;short reads;metagenomics;microorganisms;traditional culturing methods;binning problem;taxonomic group;metagenomic project;assembly;explicit features;distinct groups;supervised approaches;unsupervised approaches;reference database;unknown species;unsupervised approach;biological signature assumption;taxonomic label;k-mer distribution;LDABiMeta;MetaProb","","","","27","","29 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, very little is known about what are the main service quality attributes they care about respectively. Thus, in this paper, Europe and China, two representative markets in the tourism industry, are selected to conduct research. An experimental study is conducted and a sample of 515,738 reviews from booking.com and 10,000 reviews from ctrip.com are used. Besides, this study selects a biterm topic model that is suitable to deal with short review texts to mine the main attributes. Finally, seven categories of attributes are found. Results demonstrate that European customers care more about environment, facility, price, and food, while Chinese customers pay more attention to cleanness.

Poetry in India has its strong roots with world famous and excellent poets, amongst few renowned poets are “Universal Poet” Rabindranath Tagore, “Nightingale of India” Sarojini Naidu and “Swami” Vivekananda. Poetry style varies from country to country depending on the author. Author’s poetry topics, words and style depends on the circumstances they raised in, situations they faced, and their mind set. Many authors who belongs to India but settled in western countries and written their poems, in this context automatically identifying a poem’s author is a challenging task for the literary scholars who analyze the poetry. In this work authors proposed a method based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) topic modeling to classify the poetry written by Indian or western(American)poet based on the distribution of topics per document. The experiment is performed on 3 data sets 128, 1600 and author wise poems respectively. This experiment is performed based on semantic features.

In this paper, we expand our work by investigating: a second task (developer identification), the effects of including different changeset parts in the model, the repository characteristics that affect the accuracy of our approach, and the effects of the time invariance assumption on evaluation results. Our results demonstrate that our approach is as accurate as the standard approach for projects with most changes localized to a subset of the code, but less accurate when changes are highly distributed throughout the code. Moreover, our results demonstrate that context and messages are key to the accuracy of changeset-based models and that the time invariance assumption has a statistically significant effect on evaluation results, providing overly-optimistic results.

Most of existing algorithms detect the bursty events either by discovering the co-occurrent bursty words or the emerging topics, ignoring the association between bursty and topics. Meanwhile, these algorithms are not able to cope with short text data like Weibo and Twitter. This paper proposes two novel probabilistic generative models (TBE/TBEP). TBE model can detect bursty events on long articles which can simultaneously consider the co-occurrent relationships among bursty words as well as the co-occurrent relationships among occurrent words and the underlying topics which generate the bursty events. TBEP model captures the assumption: one post are always have the one topic, which can handle the bursty events on Weibo and Twitter. The Gibbs sampling technique is adopted to estimate the model parameters. Extensive experiments are performed on three real data sets and the promising results, compared with the state-of-the-art Hot-Bursty-Event detection algorithms, have demonstrated that the proposed approach can: (1) achieve better model performance with respect to the evaluation criteria; (2) achieve more accurate bursty evnets on long/short text data.","","978-1-5386-3016-7","10.1109/SPAC.2017.8304365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8304365","Bursty Event detection;Topic Model;Social Media;Gibbs Sampling","Event detection;Feature extraction;Probabilistic logic;Gaussian distribution;Security;Pattern analysis;Cybernetics","probability;social networking (online)","probabilistic topic model based approach;co-occurrent bursty words;bursty topics;probabilistic generative models;co-occurrent relationships;bursty events detection;social media data;social networks;TBEP model;Weibo;Twitter;Gibbs sampling technique","","1","","16","","1 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Contemporary software systems contain voluminous and complex information stored in software repositories. Software maintenance professionals spend significant amount of time in search and exploration of these repositories for common maintenance tasks like bug fixing, feature enhancements, code refactoring and reengineering. Therefore, tools and methods to facilitate search in software repositories can aid software maintenance professionals to have faster access to required information and increase productivity. A domain-specific lexical resource is an important tool to bridge the semantic gap existing between the information need and search query. In this work, we investigate the use of information retrieval (IR) based topic models (like LSI and LDA) to infer semantically related terms for a software context specific lexical resource. We perform our experiments on Google Chromium - a widely popular open-source browser - issue tracker system which contains 134,000+ bug reports. We divide our study into two parts - (1) In the first part, we apply our IR models on free form natural language textual data present in defect tracking systems. We perform qualitative analysis on the obtained output and uncover semantically related terms in the Google Chromium software context. We observe that we are able to infer semantically similar term pairs in four different contexts of English language, Software, Google Chromium and Code details. (2) In second part of this study, we utilize the semantically inferred terms obtained from the output of IR models to facilitate the software maintenance task of duplicate bug report detection. Our results demonstrate that the use of IR based topic models on defect tracking systems to automatically infer semantically related terms can help build a software domain-specific lexical resource and reduce the vocabulary gap.","2572-6129","978-1-5386-3077-8","10.1109/IC3.2017.8284329","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8284329","Automated Software Engineering;Issue Tracking System;Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA);Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI);Mining Software Repositories;Software Maintenance","Computer bugs;Google;Chromium;Software maintenance;Large scale integration;Semantics","information retrieval;program debugging;public domain software;software maintenance","software maintenance professionals;open-source browser - issue tracker system;software repositories;contemporary software systems;software development life-cycle;software-specific semantic related term pairs;software domain-specific lexical resource;IR based topic models;software maintenance task;semantically inferred terms;semantically similar term pairs;Google Chromium software context;defect tracking systems;IR models;software context specific lexical resource;semantically related terms;information retrieval based topic models","","","","16","","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analyzing these short texts can help companies discover what topics users are complaining about. It is critical to locate and respond to these complaints timely so that companies can improve users’ satisfaction and loyalty. As the data volume is large, topic model can help discover key complaint topics quickly. The complaint data are in the form of short texts and streams, traditional topic models like LDA and BTM are not suitable in this scenario, for the reason that LDA is designed for long texts and BTM can not handle streams. This paper firstly proposes an improved shorttext topic model called PMITI-BTM to generate topics from user complaint data statically, and then further extends this algorithm into a dynamic one to suit the streaming feature of data. To further analyze the topic evolution, we finally propose a clustering algorithm called TDWAP to acquire the evolution process of these topics in different time slices. For each algorithm, we do several experiments to prove its efficiency.

Existing topic models for short texts mainly focus on relieving the sparse problem to enhance the accuracy performance of topic modeling. However, most previous topic modeling approaches introduce external corpus word embeddings to enrich the global semantic information in the topic modeling process, ignoring the local association information of the target corpus. And the global semantic information provided by word embedding may not be entirely suitable for the target corpus. In most cases, the noise will be introduced to interfere with the reasoning of the topic. This paper proposes a novel topic model for short text called the Dual View Biterm Topic Model (DV-BTM). Specifically, DV-BTM constructs two views while learning local information from the target corpus and global information to auxiliarily infer about the topic. The semantic similarity view provides global information obtained by introducing pre-trained word embeddings on an external corpus. The Wordnet view is constructed based on the target corpus itself, mainly providing local information about the corpus. Finally, through the collaborative optimization of the dual views, the consistency of the extracted topics is improved. The DV-BTM experiments on two real-world short text datasets demonstrate that DV-BTM has the best performance among the comparison methods in topic coherence and text classification aspects.","","978-1-6654-7480-1","10.1109/DSC55868.2022.00028","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900168","Topic Model;Short Texts;Semantic Similarity View;WordNet View","Social networking (online);Semantics;Text categorization;Cyberspace;Collaboration;Coherence;Data science","","","","","","23","IEEE","29 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of this paper is twofold: it first shows that normalizing the weights in the vector space, for the document-term matrix of the text documents, dramatically improves the quality of clusters and hence the accuracy of clustering when using k-means algorithm. The results are compared to a recent study on clustering Arabic text documents. Second, it shows that the combined method is superior in terms of clustering quality for Arabic text documents according to external measures, such as purity, F-measure, entropy, accuracy, and other measures. It is shown in this paper that the purity of the combined method is 0.933 compared to 0.82 for k-means algorithm, and these figures are higher in comparison to a recent similar study. This is also confirmed by the other used validation measures.

Cyber-criminals often use information-sharing social media platforms such as paste sites (e.g., Pastebin) to share vast amounts of plain text content related to Personally Identifiable Information (PII), credit card numbers, exploit code, malware, and other sensitive content. Paste sites can provide targeted Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) about potential threats and prior breaches. In this research, we propose a novel Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to categorize pastes automatically. Our proposed BERT-LDA model leverages a neural network transformer architecture to capture sequential dependencies when representing each sentence in a paste. BERT-LDA replaces the Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach in the conventional LDA with a Bag-of-Labels (BoL) that encompasses class labels at the sequence level. We compared the performance of the proposed BERT-LDA against the conventional LDA and BERT-LDA variants (e.g., GPT2-LDA) on 4,254,453 pastes from three paste sites. Experiment results indicate that the proposed BERT-LDA outperformed the standard LDA and each BERT-LDA variant in terms of perplexity on each paste site. Results of our BERT-LDA case study suggest that significant content relating to hacker community activities, malicious code, network and website vulnerabilities, and PII are shared on paste sites. The insights provided by this study could be used by organizations to proactively mitigate potential damage on their infrastructure.","","978-1-6654-3838-4","10.1109/ISI53945.2021.9624765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9624765","Paste sites;Pastebin;topic modeling;transformers;BERT;malicious content;exploit code;cyber threat intelligence","Codes;Social networking (online);Bit error rate;Standards organizations;Neural networks;Organizations;Transformers","computer crime;data mining;data privacy;Internet;invasive software;public domain software;security of data;social networking (online);text analysis","paste site;neural topic modeling approach;malicious cyber activities;information-sharing social media platforms;credit card numbers;Cyber Threat Intelligence;BERT-LDA model leverages;BERT-LDA variant","","1","","27","","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To do so, we introduce an original topic model, Time Series Impact Through Topic Modeling (TSITM), that includes contextual data by coupling Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with linear regression, using an elastic net prior to set to zero the impact of uncorrelated topics. The resulting topics act as explanatory variables for the regression of the numerical time series, which allows us to understand the time series movements based on the events described on the text data. We have tested our model on two datasets: first, we used political news to explain the US president’s disapproval ratings; then, we considered a corpus of economic news to explain the financial returns of 4 different multinational corporations. Our experiments show that an appropriate selection of hyperparameters (via repeated random subsampling validation and Bayesian optimization) leads to significant correlations: both an intrinsic baseline and state of the art methods were significantly outperformed by TSITM in MSE, MAE and out-of-sample  $R^{2}$ , according to our hypothesis tests.

In order to grasp the characteristics of the topic, we visualized the change of the frequency of the occurrence and the top words on a monthly basis. In order to calculate similarity between topics, we used cosine similarity in which the frequency of word occurrence per topic was used.

Faced with the increasing numbers of Web services and service users, researchers in the services computing field have attempted to address a challenging issue, i.e., how to quickly find the suitable ones according to user queries. Many previous studies have been reported towards this direction. In this paper, a novel Web service discovery approach based on topic models is presented. The proposed approach mines common topic groups from the service-topic distribution matrix generated by topic modeling, and the extracted common topic groups can then be leveraged to match user queries to relevant Web services, so as to make a better trade-off between the accuracy of service discovery and the number of candidate Web services. Experiment results conducted on two publicly-available data sets demonstrate that, compared with several widely used approaches, the proposed approach can maintain the performance of service discovery at an elevated level by greatly decreasing the number of candidate Web services, thus leading to faster response time.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2712744","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2014CB340404); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0800400); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61272111,61373037,61672387); Wuhan Yellow Crane Talents Program for Modern Services Industry; Strategic Team-Building of Scientific and Technological Innovation in Hubei Province, C-type Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939969","Common topic group;Web service discovery;topic model;query response time","Web services;Ontologies;Semantics;Time factors;Service computing;Computational modeling","data mining;open systems;query processing;Web services","Web service discovery approach;common topic groups extraction;abstraction;interoperability;heterogeneous software systems;distributed software applications;Internet;user queries;topic models;common topic group mining;service-topic distribution matrix;topic modeling","","25","","39","OAPA","6 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The biggest challenges of TDT are the sparsity and complexity of data, organization of topic granularity, unexpectedness of emergency topics, and the unpredictability of topics evolution. This paper proposes a new TDT method based on event ontology for hierarchical topic detection and tracking topic evolution, named TDTEO. As domain-oriented event knowledge base, the event ontology provides event classes hierarchy based on domain common sense, as well a set of scenario models that describe the occurrence and evolution of different types of emergency events. The proposed method solves the problem that new emerging events are easy to be missed in the process of topic detection, and solves the problem that the topic model is easy to result in semantics drift due to the dynamic evolution of topic, and it can effectively improve the accuracy of topic detection and tracking. Experiments show our models achieve satisfactory performance of topic detection with a maximum macro-F1 value of 85.25%, and the (CDet)Norm of topic tracking in the datasets is as low as 0.1028.

Usually, TM algorithms rely on unigrams as the basic text generation unit, whereas the quality and intelligibility of the identified topics would significantly benefit from the detection and usage of topical phrasemes. Following on from previous research, in this paper we propose the first iterative algorithm to extend STM with n-grams, and we test our solution on textual data collected from four well-known ToR drug marketplaces. Significantly, we employ a STM-guided n-gram selection process, so that topic-specific phrasemes can be identified regardless of their global relevance in the corpus. Our experiments show that enriching the dictionary with selected n-grams improves the usability of STM, allowing the discovery of key information hidden in an apparently ""mono-thematic"" dataset.","","978-1-5386-4408-9","10.1109/ICSC.2018.00048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8334471","STM;N-grams;Tor;Markets","Drugs;Semantics;Compounds;Cryptography;Computational modeling;Organizations;Iterative methods","data mining;drug delivery systems;information retrieval;iterative methods;natural language processing;text analysis;word processing","generative model;multiword structural topic modelling;thematic organization inference;text generation unit;topic-specific phrasemes;n-gram selection process;iterative algorithm;TM algorithms;topic mining algorithm;document-level covariate information;text corpora;ToR drug marketplaces;STM","","2","","14","","12 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the one hand, the multispectral instrument (MSI), carried by S2, provides high spatial resolution images. On the other hand, the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), one of the instruments of S3, captures the Earth's surface at a substantially coarser spatial resolution but using smaller spectral bandwidths, which makes the OLCI data more convenient to highlight specific spectral features and motivates the development of synergetic fusion products. In this scenario, the approach presented here takes advantage of the proposed constrained probabilistic latent semantic analysis (CpLSA) model to produce intersensor vegetation estimations, which aim at synergically exploiting MSI's spatial resolution and OLCI's spectral characteristics. Initially, CpLSA is used to uncover the MSI reflectance patterns, which are able to represent the OLCI-derived vegetation. Then, the original MSI data are projected onto this higher abstraction-level representation space in order to generate a high-resolution version of the vegetation captured in the OLCI domain. Our experimental comparison, conducted using four data sets, three different regression algorithms, and two vegetation indices, reveals that the proposed framework is able to provide a competitive advantage in terms of quantitative and qualitative vegetation estimation results.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2019.2903231","Generalitat Valenciana(grant numbers:APOSTD/2017/007); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad(grant numbers:ESP2016-79503-C2-2-P,TIN2015-63646-C5-5-R); Junta de Extremadura(grant numbers:GR18060); European Union under the H2020 EOXPOSURE project(grant numbers:734541); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8674589","Constrained probabilistic latent semantic analysis (CpLSA);Sentinel-2;Sentinel-3;topic models;vegetation estimation","Vegetation mapping;Spatial resolution;Estimation;Analytical models;Instruments;Probabilistic logic;Semantics","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image colour analysis;image fusion;image resolution;probability;regression analysis;vegetation;vegetation mapping","multispectral instrument;high spatial resolution images;MSI reflectance patterns;OLCI-derived vegetation;Sentinel-3 intersensor vegetation estimation;constrained topic modeling;fused vegetation maps;Sentinel-2 intersensor vegetation estimation;ocean and land color instrument;spectral features;constrained probabilistic latent semantic analysis;regression algorithms","","14","","21","IEEE","26 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, the paper proposes a hybrid method for recommending test cases in two steps by using the above data. As the thirst step, it recommends test cases which are highly-similar to the manually-selected ones. Then, as the second step, the method recommends the remaining test cases in decreasing order of priority computed by using the test history.

Identifying relevant and trending societal matters is important, and often done for traditional social media channels such as Twitter. In this paper we explore whether this type of analysis can also be used for introspection of the software world, by looking at the thriving scene of Scratch programmers. The educational programming language Scratch is not only used for teaching programming concepts, but also offers a platform for young programmers to express and share their creativity on any topics of relevance. By automatically analyzing titles and project comments in a dataset of 106.032 Scratch projects, we explore which topics are common in the Scratch community, whether socially relevant events are reflected, and how the sentiment in the comments discussing these topics is. It turns out that the diversity of topics within the Scratch projects makes the analysis process challenging. Our results nevertheless show that topics from pop and net culture are present, and even recent societal events such as the Covid-19 pandemic or BLM are to some extent reflected in Scratch. The tone in the comments is mostly positive with catchy youth language. Hence, despite the challenges, Scratch projects can be studied in the same way as social networks, which opens up new possibilities to improve our understanding of the behavior and motivation of novice programmers. Analyzing the content and emotions within a social network provides insights on how software engineers communicate and what they talk about. The Scratch programming environment is extremely popular with young, learning programmers. In this paper we investigate whether social network analysis in terms of automatically identifying topics and sentiments can also be ap-plied to Scratch. We analyze the topics of the projects that young programmers create and share, and determine the tone of their conversations. Although the process turns out to be technically challenging, we encounter pop and net culture references but also societal matters, and the overall tone of communication is positive.","","978-1-6654-9594-3","10.1145/3510458.3513021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793995","Scratch;topic modeling;sentiment analysis;social network","Analytical models;Sentiment analysis;Social networking (online);Pandemics;Education;Oral communication;Software","computer aided instruction;computer science education;programming;programming languages;social networking (online);software engineering;teaching","software engineers;Scratch programming environment;social network analysis;young programmers;topic modeling;sentiment analysis;SCRATCH projects;Matter movement influence software engineering;identifying relevant;trending societal matters;traditional social media channels;Scratch programmers;educational programming language Scratch;teaching programming concepts;titles;project comments;Scratch community;socially relevant events;Scratch projects;recent societal events","","","","35","","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instagram, Facebook, VKontakte, and other popular social networks contain a vast amount of valuable data. This information reflects individual stories of people and the background of the city, its events, and current activities in different areas and places of attraction. City events have essential attributes like the time of occurrence, geographical coverage, audience, and often expressed interests or topics. Owning the subject of events, you can solve a whole range of tasks - from individual recommendation systems for leisure activities for citizens and tourists to providing services in the field of food (food trucks) and transport (taxis). To determine the topic (subject) of events, it is necessary to solve two crucial tasks: to identify the events themselves from a variety of city posts and to develop an approach based on modern natural language processing methods for identifying events topics. To determine the events, we suggest an improved algorithm that we had previously developed that integrates time window and area coverage strategy. However, the focus of the work is on the analysis of different approaches to identifying topics, considering the heterogeneity of posts, both in semantic meaning and in size and structure. The focus of this paper is the importance of using post hashtags in various variations to set up more accurate models. In addition, the analysis of features for different language groups was carried out.","","978-1-6654-4337-1","10.1109/ICMLA52953.2021.00255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9680257","Topic modeling;Hashtag;Text clustering;Social media;Event detection","Social networking (online);Conferences;Urban areas;Semantics;Multimedia Web sites;Machine learning;Natural language processing","natural language processing;recommender systems;social networking (online)","essential aspect;topic modeling;city events;social media;digital information;popular social networks;current activities;essential attributes;expressed interests;individual recommendation systems;leisure activities;city posts;modern natural language processing methods;events topics;integrates time window;area coverage strategy;identifying topics;post hashtags","","","","27","","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

People extensively use those platforms during the outbreak of the COVID-19 to cope with social distancing and isolation by expressing their opinions, views, and issues they are facing. The study used Twitter as the social media platform to discover the emotional perspective of Sri Lankans during the outbreak. The emotion analysis was conducted based on 8-scale emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust) provided by the NRC Emotion Lexicon. The extraction of noteworthy topics propagated in different domains of COVID-19 helps to identify the perception of society during the pandemic. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was applied to explore relevant and accurate topics. Furthermore, the wordcloud was generated by representing the most insightful data points which help to keep track of social concerns or viewpoints. Our experiment shows that people discuss under three major themes of ""COVID-19 Immunization"", ""Government rules and regulations to prevent the spread of COVID-19"" and ""COVID-19 related health statistics"". Furthermore, the ""fear"" is dominated among eight emotions followed by ""anticipation"" and ""sadness"" when Sri Lankans express their thoughts and feelings related to COVID-19. There is a noticeable decrease in ""joy"" which is the least expressed emotion followed by ""trust"". Hence, clearly defined, these findings support in predicting the COVID-19 related outcomes and addressing the concerns, emotions, and reactions of citizens by the government and the policymakers.","","978-1-6654-0741-0","10.1109/ICARC54489.2022.9753866","Ministry of Higher Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9753866","COVID-19;emotion;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;NRC Emotion Lexicon;social media;topic modelling;Tweets","COVID-19;Analytical models;Social networking (online);Pandemics;Government;Blogs;Social factors","emotion recognition;epidemics;social networking (online)","Twitter messages;COVID-19 pandemic;Sri lanka;topic modelling;emotion analysis;rapid dissemination;influenceable communication tool;outbreak;social distancing;social media platform;emotional perspective;8-scale emotions;NRC Emotion Lexicon;noteworthy topics;relevant topics;accurate topics;social concerns;COVID-19 Immunization;COVID-19 related health statistics;expressed emotion;COVID-19 related outcomes","","","","32","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We define a fake retweeter as a Twitter account that retweets spammy tweets, retweets an abnormally large amount of tweets in a short period, or misuses a trending hashtag to promote events irrelevant to the topic of discussion. We introduce an up-to-date, temporally diverse, trend-oriented labeled dataset to address the problem of fake retweeter detection. We develop a novel classifier, called HawkesEye which makes predictions based on a temporal window, in contrast to existing approaches which require a graph-like relationship between tweet entities, or the presence of the entire retweeting timeline of a retweeter. HawkesEye utilizes both temporal and textual information using a class-specific topic model and Hawkes processes. Experiments on our curated dataset show significant improvement over four state-of-the-art methods, with precision and recall scores of 0.964 and 0.960 on a balanced dataset, respectively – HawkesEye beats the best baseline by 6.16% and 25.98% relative improvement in terms of precision and recall, respectively.

In many real-world scenarios, customer textual data should be private and sensitive, precluding uploading to data centers. This paper proposes a Federated NMF (FedNMF) framework, which allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a high-quality NMF based topic model with locally stored data. However, standard federated learning will significantly undermine the performance of topic models in downstream tasks (e.g., text classification) when the data distribution over clients is heterogeneous. To alleviate this issue, we further propose FedNMF+MI, which simultaneously maximizes the mutual information (MI) between the count features of local texts and their topic weight vectors to mitigate the performance degradation. Experimental results show that our FedNMF+MI methods outperform Federated Latent Dirichlet Allocation (FedLDA) and the FedNMF without MI methods for short texts by a significant margin on both coherence score and classification F1 score.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-8671-9","10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9892602","Federated learning;Topic modelling;Nonnegative matrix factorization","Degradation;Training;Text categorization;Neural networks;Data models;Natural language processing;Resource management","","","","","","39","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given a corpus, HDP is able to determine the number of topics automatically, possessing an important feature dubbed nonparametric that overcomes the challenging issue of manually specifying a suitable topic number in parametric topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Nevertheless, HDP requires a much higher computational cost than LDA for parameter estimation. By taking the advantage of multi-threading, a parallel Gibbs sampling algorithm is proposed to estimate parameters for HDP based on the equivalence between HDP and Gamma-Gamma Poisson Process (G2PP) in terms of the generative process. Unfortunately, the above parallel Gibbs sampling algorithm requires to apply the finite approximation on the number of topics manually (i.e., predefine the topic number), thus can not retain the nonparametric feature of HDP. Another drawback of the above models is the lack of capturing the semantic dependencies between words, because the topic assignment of words is independent with each other. Although some works have been done in phrase-based topic modelling, these existing methods are still limited by either enforcing the entire phrase to share a common topic or requiring much complex and time-consuming phrase mining methods. In this paper, we aim to develop a copula guided parallel Gibbs sampling algorithm for HDP which can adjust the number of topics dynamically and capture the latent semantic dependencies between words that compose a coherent segment. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets indicate that our method achieves low perplexities and high topic coherence scores with a small time cost. In addition, we validate the effectiveness of our method on the modelling of word semantic dependencies by comparing the extracted topical phrases with those learned by state-of-the-art phrase-based baselines.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.2976945","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972426); Interdisciplinary Research Scheme of the Dean's Research Fund 2018-19(grant numbers:FLASS/DRF/IDS-3); Departmental Collaborative Research Fund 2019 of The Education University of Hong Kong(grant numbers:MIT/DCRF-R2/18-19); HKIBS Research Seed Fund 2019/20 of Lingnan University, Hong Kong(grant numbers:190-009); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:UGC/FDS16/E01/19); RGC of the Hong Kong SAR(grant numbers:CityU 11507219,CityU 11525716); NSFC Basic Research Program(grant numbers:71671155); CityU Shenzhen Research Institute; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1711262,U1611264,U1711261,U1811261,U1811264,U1911203); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:C1031-18G); Hong Kong Polytechnic University(grant numbers:1.9B0V); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9018114","Topic modelling;parallel gibbs sampling;copulas","Semantics;Bayes methods;Inference algorithms;Data models;Computational modeling;Resource management;Approximation algorithms","approximation theory;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;multi-threading;natural language processing;nonparametric statistics;parameter estimation;text analysis","copula guided parallel Gibbs sampling;coherent topic discovery;hierarchical Dirichlet process;natural language processing;HDP;parametric topic models;latent Dirichlet allocation;parameter estimation;generative process;topic assignment;phrase-based topic modelling;topic coherence scores;gamma-gamma Poisson process;nonparametric topic discovery;LDA;computational cost;multithreading;G2PP;finite approximation;latent semantic dependencies;coherent segment;word semantic dependencies;topical phrases;phrase-based baselines","","2","","46","IEEE","28 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When newly arrived documents convey new concepts that are not well covered in a hierarchy, it may be appropriate to split an existing category or insert a new category, to which related documents are relocated, in the hierarchy. However, it is often difficult to decide whether to create a new category or not (which we call the category-expansion problem). To address this problem, we propose a novel hierarchical topic model, which we call Generalized SSHLDA (G-SSHLDA). This model can insert a latent subtree at any level in an observed hierarchy. In the latent subtree, its root node can be an arbitrary observed node, and the other nodes are latent nodes. One of the nodes in the latent subtree is linked up with a deeper-level observed node. On the basis of these ideas, G-SSHLDA can automatically expand a category hierarchy that is associated with the target data collection. We demonstrate through experiments with two real-world datasets that G-SSHLDA effectively addresses the category-expansion problem.","2375-9356","978-1-5386-7789-6","10.1109/BIGCOMP.2019.8679402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8679402","","Vegetation;Data collection;Data models;Stochastic processes;Informatics;Encyclopedias;Internet","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","G-SSHLDA;category hierarchy;category-expansion problem;hierarchical topic models;latent subtree;observed hierarchy;arbitrary observed node;latent nodes;hierarchical topic model","","1","","15","","4 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In earlier studies, researchers attempted to address this problem by either 1) tweet aggregation, where related tweets are combined into a single document or 2) tweet expansion with related text from external sources. The first approach faces the problem of losing the topic distribution in individual tweets. While finding a relevant text from the external source for a random tweet in the second approach is challenging for various reasons like differences in writing styles, multilingual content, and informal text. In contrast to adding context from external resources or combining related tweets into a pool, this study uses the internal vocabulary (hashtags) to counter under-specificity and sparsity in tweets. Earlier studies have indicated hashtags to be an important feature for representing the underlying context present in the tweet. Sequential models like Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) over distributed representation of words have shown promising results in capturing semantic relationships between words of a tweet in the past. Motivated by the above, this article proposes a unified framework of hashtag-based tweet expansion exploiting text-based and network-based representation learning methods such as BiLSTM, BERT, and Graph Convolution Network (GCN). The hashtag-based expanded tweets using the proposed framework have significantly improved topic modeling performance compared to un-expanded (raw) tweets and hashtag-pooling-based approaches over two real-world tweet datasets of different nature. Furthermore, this article also studies the significance of hashtags in topic modeling performance by experimenting with different combination of word types such as hashtags, keywords, and user mentions.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2022.3171206","Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology Government of India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9787710","BERT;Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM);Co-occurrence Frequency Expansion (CoFE);Graph Convolution Network (GCN);hashtags;Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA);topic modeling;tweet expansion;twitter.","Feature extraction;Internet;Encyclopedias;Semantics;Online services;Task analysis;Social networking (online)","","","","","","","IEEE","3 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Topic modeling techniques are helpful to find out topics that people are talking about. However, current full-analysis models cannot perform well on a focused analysis task—find out all topics related to one particular area in short documents. One reason is that the targeted topic is usually sparse in the corpus of short texts. Another one is, during clustering, even minor errors may compound and render the model useless. This article studies these problems and proposes a targeted analysis model (TAM) with reinforcement learning (RL) to extract any specific topic in a given corpus and perform fine-grained topic generation. In this work, we design a reward function of RL to prevent the false propagation problem induced by Gibbs sampling during the clustering. We amend the targeted topic modeling techniques to the case of RL and use policy search combined with the Gibbs EM algorithm for parameter estimation. Metrics of F1 score and the proposed normalized mutual information-F1 are exploited for the evaluation of clustering and topic generation, respectively. Our experiments have demonstrated that TAM can outperform state-of-the-art models—specifically achieving 25.7% improvement on the F1 score for binary clustering on average.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3009247","Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2019YFB1600704); Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau, SAR(grant numbers:SKL-IOTSC-2018-2020,FDCT/0045/2019/A1,FDCT/0007/2018/A1); Guangzhou Science and Technology Innovation and Development Commission(grant numbers:EF005/FSTGZG/2019/GSTIC); Research Committee of University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2017-00212-FST,MYRG2018-00129-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9152157","Reinforcement learning (RL);targeted analysis model (TAM);text mining;topic modeling","Analytical models;Task analysis;Learning (artificial intelligence);Probabilistic logic;Learning systems;Social network services","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;social networking (online);text analysis","topic modeling techniques;full-analysis models;focused analysis task;short documents;targeted topic;short texts;targeted analysis model;TAM;reinforcement learning;RL;specific topic;fine-grained topic generation;state-of-the-art models-specifically;mining topics;hot topic discovery","","1","","43","IEEE","29 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The framework benefits from the repetitive structure posed by multiple machines and enables for assessment of health condition, degradation modeling and comparison of machines. It is based on a hierarchical probabilistic model, denoted Gaussian topic model (GTM), where cluster patterns are shared over machines and therefore it allows one to directly obtain proportions of patterns over the machines. This is then used as a basis for cross comparison between machines where identified similarities and differences can lead to important insights about their degradation behaviors. The framework is based on aggregation of data over multiple streams by a predefined set of features extracted over a time window. Moreover, the framework contains a clustering schema which takes uncertainty of cluster assignments into account and where one can specify a desirable degree of reliability of the assignments. By using a multi-machine simulation example, we highlight how the framework can be utilized in order to obtain cluster patterns and inherent variations of such patterns over machines. Furthermore, a comparative study with the commonly used Gaussian mixture model (GMM) demonstrates that GTM is able to identify inherent patterns in the data while the GMM fails. Such result is a consequence of the group level being modeled by the GTM while being absent in the GMM. Hence, the GTM are trained with a view on the data that is not available to the GMM with the consequence that the GMM can miss important, possibly even key cluster patterns. Therefore, we argue that more advanced cluster models, like the GTM, can be key for interpreting and understanding degradation behavior across machines and ultimately for obtaining more efficient and reliable PdM systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3096387","Vinnova, Project: Predictive Maintenance using Advanced Cluster Analysis (PACA)(grant numbers:2019-00789); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9481148","Exploratory data analysis;cluster analysis;Gaussian topic modeling;hierarchical modeling;multi-machine analysis;multiple data streams;predictive maintenance","Data models;Manufacturing;Prognostics and health management;Companies;Analytical models;Predictive models;Predictive maintenance","","","","","","58","CCBY","12 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To fill this research gap, we develop a change-point topic model that incorporates multinomial logit models into multi-dimensional latent Dirichlet allocation to decompose the spatiotemporal pattern into a mixture of activity patterns; meanwhile, our model captures the changing regularity of activity prevalence and its latent changes by integrating Dirichlet multinomial regression and hidden Markov models. We estimate the parameters of our model based on collapsed Gibbs sampling. We conduct numerical experiments using publicly available bike sharing trip records collected in New York. Results show that our model successfully distinguishes several meaningful activity categories, such as commuting.

To address this problem, we propose a novel topic modeling method for non-uniform text topic modeling referred to as self-adaptive sliding window based topic model (SSWTM).

Based on this assumption, SSWTM extracts relevant words by using a selfadaptive sliding window and models on the whole corpus. The self-adaptive sliding window can filter noisy information and change the size of a window according to different text contents.

Hence, to address this problem, we have proposed a system, to organize the mails according to their priority based on the context and communication history between the clients. An algorithm was designed using machine learning and natural language processing to recommend Top ‘N’ emails from bulk so that the person can focus on important tasks at hand and get them done as fast as possible. The model was trained using Enron Email Dataset. For discovering topics from the document, LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) Topic Modeling was used. During model training, a maximum coherence score of 0.53987 was observed and the minimum perplexity score was -13.985 for the Number of Topics equal to 20.

In this study, we propose three approaches for exploring the context and comprehending the content and sentiment users discussed in online gossip threads: netnography, topic modelling, and sentiment analysis. We retrieved 6055 conversation threads, including three social media celebrity threads, from an online forum called Cari Forum. Using netnography, we were able to identify seven topics in the thread. The thread was then further analysed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling approach. We discovered that seven is the optimal number of topics detected in the thread with no overlap. We used the Logistic Regression Model to evaluate each conversation thread's sentiment. We identify each topic's positive and negative sentiment, obtained through our sentiment analysis approach.

The employment of the probabilistic topic model to acquire latent topics and the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to capture deep features for representing HSR images has been an effective ways to bridge the semantic gap. However, the midlevel topic features are usually local and significant, whereas the high-level deep features convey more global and detailed information. In this paper, to discover more discriminative semantics for HSR images, the adaptive deep sparse semantic modeling (ADSSM) framework combining sparse topics and deep features is proposed for HSR image scene classification. In ADSSM, the fully sparse topic model and a CNN are integrated. To exploit the multilevel semantics for HSR scenes, the sparse topic features and deep features are effectively fused at the semantic level. Based on the difference between the sparse topic features and the deep features, an adaptive feature normalization strategy is proposed to improve the fusion of the different features.

Others leverage word embeddings, which consider local conditional dependencies, to map a document as a summation vector of them. Unlike the existing works which explore the strategy of utilizing one to help the other, i.e., topic models for word embeddings or vice versa, we propose CME-DMM, a collaboratively modeling and embedding framework for capturing coherent latent topics from short texts. CME-DMM incorporates topic and word embeddings through the attention mechanism and implants them into the latent topic models, which significantly improve the quality of latent topics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CME-DMM could perceive more coherent topics than other popular methods, resulting in a better performance in downstream NLP tasks such as classification. Besides the interpretable latent topics, the corresponding topic embeddings can describe the meanings of latent topics in the semantic space.

This paper is aimed at filling this gap, by investigating the usefulness of topic models in the analysis of NMR spectra. In particular, we first introduce an unsupervised approach, based on topic models, that performs soft biclustering of NMR spectra-this kind of unsupervised analysis being new in the NMR literature.

In recent years, the employment of the probabilistic topic model to mine latent topics in hyperspectral images has been an effective way for spectral unmixing. However, these methods fail to fully exploit the potential of topic models in uncovering image semantics and need extra sparsity constraints, which greatly increases the complexity of the model. In addition, the spatial information which can provide the correlation of features in adjacent pixels is usually ignored in topic model-based HU. To solve these problems, a spectral-spatial unmixing framework of hyperspectral imagery based on a sparse topic relaxation-clustering model ( $\mathrm{S}^{3}{\mathrm {TRM}}$ ) is proposed. In  $\mathrm{S}^{3}{\mathrm {TRM}}$ , the topic model combined with implied sparse prior constraints are introduced, and the sparse characteristics of  $\mathrm{S}^{3}{\mathrm {TRM}}$  are used to capture the semantic representation of the spectrum. With the proposed relaxation-clustering strategy, multiple possible spectral representations of features can be obtained, which further alleviates the influence caused by endmember variability. Group clustering is used to locate the endmember quickly and accurately. Moreover, superpixel segmentation is considered to supplement the spatial distribution information of features, thereby improving the fractional abundance. Experiments on a synthetic dataset and three well-known real hyperspectral datasets confirm the excellent performance of the proposed framework in both qualitative assessment and quantitative evaluation, compared with the other state-of-the-art methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3117250","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41901306); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China(grant numbers:G1323519214); Open Research Project of Hubei Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geo-Information Processing(grant numbers:KLIGIP-2019A02); State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9570320","Hyperspectral unmixing (HU);relaxation-clustering strategy;sparse prior;superpixel segmentation;topic model","Transmission line measurements;Semantics;Hyperspectral imaging;Task analysis;Image segmentation;Correlation;Probabilistic logic","geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image segmentation;remote sensing","topic model-based HU;spectral-spatial unmixing framework;hyperspectral imagery;sparse topic relaxation-clustering model;implied sparse prior constraints;relaxation-clustering strategy;hyperspectral datasets;hyperspectral unmixing;hyperspectral remote sensing research;probabilistic topic model;latent topics;hyperspectral images;spectral unmixing;spatial information;S3TRM","","","","52","IEEE","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This framework adopts and combines various techniques of Natural Language Processing, such as word embedding and topic modelling. Word embedding is used to capture semantic meanings of domain-specific words. We propose two novel scientific publication embedding, i.e., P UB-G and P UB-W, which are capable of learning semantic meanings of general as well as domain-specific words in various research fields. Thereafter, topic modelling is used to identify clusters of research topics within these larger research fields. We curated apublication dataset consisting of two conferences and two journals from 1995 to 2020 from two research domains.

Recipes from different cuisines shared on the web are an indicator of culinary cultures in different countries. Therefore, analysis of these recipes can lead to deep understanding of food from the cultural perspective. In this paper, we perform the first cross-region recipe analysis by jointly using the recipe ingredients, food images, and attributes such as the cuisine and course (e.g., main dish and dessert). For that solution, we propose a culinary culture analysis framework to discover the topics of ingredient bases and visualize them to enable various applications. We first propose a probabilistic topic model to discover cuisine-course specific topics. The manifold ranking method is then utilized to incorporate deep visual features to retrieve food images for topic visualization. At last, we applied the topic modeling and visualization method for three applications: 1) multimodal cuisine summarization with both recipe ingredients and images, 2) cuisine-course pattern analysis including topic-specific cuisine distribution and cuisine-specific course distribution of topics, and 3) cuisine recommendation for both cuisine-oriented and ingredient-oriented queries. Through these three applications, we can analyze the culinary cultures at both macro and micro levels. We conduct the experiment on a recipe database Yummly-66K with 66,615 recipes from 10 cuisines in Yummly. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation results have validated the effectiveness of topic modeling and visualization, and demonstrated the advantage of the framework in utilizing rich recipe information to analyze and interpret the culinary cultures from different regions.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2017.2759499","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61532018,61602437,61672497,61572503,61620106003); Beijing Municipal Commission of Science and Technology(grant numbers:D161100001816001); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4174106,4152053); Lenovo Outstanding Young Scientists Program; National Program for Special Support of Eminent Professionals and National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2016M590135,2017T100110); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8059846","Cross-region food analysis;cuisine recommendation;cuisine summarization;culinary culture analysis;topic model","Visualization;Analytical models;Cultural differences;Pattern analysis;Metadata;Computers;Probabilistic logic","cultural aspects;data visualisation;food processing industry;Internet;pattern clustering;probability;query processing;recommender systems","culinary cultures;recipes;cultural perspective;cross-region recipe analysis;recipe ingredients;food images;culinary culture analysis framework;probabilistic topic model;cuisine-course specific topics;topic visualization;topic modeling;recipe database Yummly-66K;cross-region food analysis;rich recipe information;World Wide Web;ingredient base visualization;deep visual features;manifold ranking method;cuisine-course pattern analysis;topic-specific cuisine distribution;cuisine-specific course distribution;ingredient-oriented queries;cuisine recommendation","","46","","67","IEEE","5 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition to identifying the main topics in the given collection, topic modeling infers which combination of topics is addressed by each individual document (the so-called topic-document inference), which can be useful for their classification and organization. However, the distributional assumptions for this inference are typically restricted to the Dirichlet family which can limit the performance of the model. For this reason, in this paper we propose modeling the topic-document inference with the Gumbel-Softmax distribution, a distribution recently introduced to expand differentiability in deep networks. To set up a performing system, the proposed approach integrates Gumbel-Softmax topic-document inference in a state-of-the-art topic model based on a deep variational autoencoder.

One automatic text summarization method that produces a satisfactory summary is extractive text summarization based on density peaks clustering. Previous research that applied this method has become state-of-the-art for the DUC 2004 dataset. However, there is still an opportunity for further development, specifically by applying the artificial neural network-based sentence embedding technique to replace the embedding vector space model and LDA topic modeling that was previously used. This research proposes a cluster-based automatic text summarization system using Sentence-BERT (SBERT) to perform sentence embedding and topic modeling processes to improve the summarization technique proposed by previous research. SBERT was chosen because it has state-of-the-art performance on sentence embedding tasks, so it is expected to represent the semantic meaning of sentences better than the techniques used in previous studies. This research is the first research that applied SBERT for text summarization. This research also proposes several improvements for the sentence selection techniques used in previous studies. Based on the assessment using the ROUGE toolkit, the text summarization system built in this study succeeded in creating a better summary than the previous research.","","978-1-6654-1743-3","10.1109/ICAICTA53211.2021.9640295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9640295","text summarization;density peaks clustering;sentence-BERT;topic modeling;cluster-based text summarization;extractive text summarization;DUC 2004","Semantics;Artificial neural networks;Task analysis","","","","","","24","","16 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, textual data, collected about individuals or from individuals, can be susceptible to inference attacks that may leak private and/or sensitive information about individuals.The increasing concerns of privacy risks in textual data preclude sharing or exchanging textual data across different parties/organizations for various applications such as record linkage, similar entity matching, natural language processing (NLP), or machine learning on large collections of textual data. This has led to the development of privacy preserving techniques for applying matching, machine learning or NLP techniques on textual data that contain personal and sensitive information about individuals. While cryptographic techniques are highly secure and accurate, they incur significant amount of computational cost for encoding and matching data – especially textual data – due to the complex nature of text.In this paper, we propose an efficient textual data encoding and matching algorithm using probabilistic techniques based on counting Bloom filters combined with Differential privacy. We apply our algorithm to a popular use case scenario that involves privacy preserving topic modeling – a widely used NLP technique – in order to identify common or collective topics in texts across multiple parties without learning the individual topics of each party, and show its effectiveness in supporting this application. Finally, through extensive experimental evaluation on three large text datasets against a state-of-the-art probabilistic encoding algorithm for privacy preserving LDA topic modelling, we show that our method provides a better privacy-utility trade-off at the cost of more computation complexity and memory space, while still being computationally efficient (log-linear complexity in the size of documents) for Big data compared to cryptographic techniques that have quadratic complexity.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671552","distance-preserving encoding;textual data;counting Bloom filters;Differential privacy;topic models","Privacy;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Probabilistic logic;Motion pictures;Natural language processing;Encoding","Big Data;computational complexity;data mining;data privacy;data structures;document handling;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;security of data;text analysis","privacy preserving text Data encoding;Big Data applications;efficient textual data encoding;matching algorithm","","","","34","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing methods choose to integrate structure or contexts among posts to alleviate the data sparsity of short text, however they ignore the spread characteristics of topics. A topic can spread in depth-wise and width-wise way on social networks. Specifically, wide dispersion gives priority to the paths that will spread to the low-order neighborhood, while deep propagation may spread to the more distant users along the propagation chains. Therefore, we propose a Dual-streams Graph convolution networks based Topic Model (DGTM) for microblog conversations. It aims to learn the contexts with full spread mode feature to alleviate data sparsity of microblog posts. Firstly, a user-level social network with posts information is built by the user interactions. Then, we design a dual-streams graph convolution networks module to learn the context-richer node embeddings by modeling spread characteristics. Lastly, the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is used to fuse the features of two spread modes and generate the more coherent topics.

It becomes more and more difficult and complicated as the size of software and the number of developers increase. In this paper, we propose a new framework for bug triaging, which maps the words in the bug reports (i.e., the term space) to their corresponding topics (i.e., the topic space). We propose a specialized topic modeling algorithm named  multi-feature topic model (MTM) which extends Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for bug triaging. MTM  considers product and component information of bug reports to map the term space to the topic space. Finally, we propose an incremental learning method named TopicMiner which considers the topic distribution of a new bug report to assign an appropriate fixer based on the affinity of the fixer to the topics. We pair  TopicMiner with MTM (TopicMiner$^{MTM}$ ). We have evaluated our solution on 5 large bug report datasets including GCC, OpenOffice, Mozilla, Netbeans, and Eclipse containing a total of 227,278 bug reports. We show that TopicMiner $^{MTM}$  can achieve top-1 and top-5 prediction accuracies of 0.4831-0.6868, and 0.7686-0.9084, respectively. We also compare TopicMiner$^{MTM}$  with Bugzie, LDA-KL, SVM-LDA, LDA-Activity, and Yang et al.'s approach.

Currently, pretrained word embedding and sequence to sequence models can be effectively adapted in social network summarization to extract significant information with strong encoding capability. However, how to tackle the long text dependence and utilize the latent topic mapping has become an increasingly crucial challenge for these models. In this article, we propose a topic-aware extractive and abstractive summarization model named T-BERTSum, based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERTs). This is an improvement over previous models, in which the proposed approach can simultaneously infer topics and generate summarization from social texts. First, the encoded latent topic representation, through the neural topic model (NTM), is matched with the embedded representation of BERT, to guide the generation with the topic. Second, the long-term dependencies are learned through the transformer network to jointly explore topic inference and text summarization in an end-to-end manner. Third, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network layers are stacked on the extractive model to capture sequence timing information, and the effective information is further filtered on the abstractive model through a gated network. In addition, a two-stage extractive–abstractive model is constructed to share the information. Compared with the previous work, the proposed model T-BERTSum focuses on pretrained external knowledge and topic mining to capture more accurate contextual representations. Experimental results on the CNN/Daily mail and XSum datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art results while generating consistent topics compared with the most advanced method.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2021.3088506","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFE0104400); Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University(grant numbers:RGP-1441-33); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9464764","Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERTs);neural topic model (NTM);social network;text summarization","Bit error rate;Data mining;Context modeling;Semantics;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Training","data mining;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;recurrent neural nets;social networking (online);text analysis","topic-aware text summarization;data mining;information retrieval;natural language processing;automatic text summarization;pretrained word embedding;sequence models;social network summarization;strong encoding capability;long text dependence;latent topic mapping;abstractive summarization model;bidirectional encoder representations;social texts;neural topic model;embedded representation;transformer network;topic inference;short-term memory network layers;extractive model;sequence timing information;gated network;contextual representations;T-BERTSum model;two-stage extractive-abstractive model;latent topic representation;long short-term memory;LSTM","","","","48","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

People interested in a product can reach for these reviews on the whole Internet, thus leading to heterogeneity of data sources. As the massive amounts of data are not systematically accessible through APIs, companies frequently scrap it from several platforms and marketplaces. Data acquisition processes include some amount of ETL, yet the variability of noise contained in the data and the heterogeneity induced by different existing sources create the need for ad-hoc tools. In other words, and even if large quantities of data are accessible for virtually free, customer insight extraction is an harduous task. To circumvent this issue, we apply the Embedded Dirichlet Process (EDP) and the Embedded Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (EHDP) in a realistic setting regarding industrial practices. These neural topic models simultaneously learn the number of topics, representations of documents, topic embeddings and word embeddings from data. These properties allow for semantic units' disambiguation and for deeper text exploration than other approaches. As such, they can also serve as a way to refine industrial ETL processes. When not higher, both the EDP and the EHDP models achieve similar likelihood than other methods in our experimental settings, while providing with more analytical levels.

However, it is challenging to deal with multi-modal data (i.e., text, images, and videos contained in the social media data) as well as the modality dependence and missing modality. In this paper, we present a novel deep topical correlation analysis (DTCA) approach, which achieves robust and accurate topic detection for microblogs and simultaneously handles the two challenges aforementioned. In particular, bidirectional recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks are used to learn deep textual and visual features, respectively. Then, a canonical correlation analysis-based fusion scheme is proposed, which has two innovations to deal with both modality independence and modality missing, i.e., a filter gate to capture the modality dependency and a matrix-projection based component to handle the missing modality. DTCA is trained in an end-to-end manner, in which the parameters of visual, textual, and cross-modal prediction parts are trained jointly. We further release a large-scale cross-modal twitter dataset for topic detection, denoted as TM-Twitter. On this dataset, extensive and quantitative evaluations are conducted with comparisons to several state-of-the-art and alternative approaches.

Still, developers often face challenges in finding appropriate web APIs as they have to go through thousands of available ones. Recommending relevant web APIs might help, but very low API invocation from mashup applications creates a sparse dataset for the recommendation models to learn about the mashups and their invocation pattern, ultimately affecting their accuracy. Effectively reducing sparsity and using supplemental information such as mashup and web API specific features that trigger mashups to invoke the same web APIs in their applications and web APIs to be used together by a mashup can help to generate more accurate and useful recommendations. In this work, we developed a novel web API recommendation model for mashup application, which uses two-level topic modeling of mashups and user interaction with mashup and web APIs sequentially to reduce the sparsity of the initial dataset. Then, we applied regularized matrix factorization with the mashup and web API embeddings. These embeddings integrate 'mashup to mashup' and 'web API to web API' relationships with 'mashup to web API' invocation analysis.

We go beyond click graph and propose two probabilistic topic models, Topic Independence Model and Topic Dependence Model. The former adopts the assumption that the generation of query terms and URLs are topically independent, and the latter captures the coupling between search queries and URLs. We also capture the temporal burstiness of topics by utilizing continuous Beta distribution. Through a large-scale analysis of a real-life search query log, we observe that each user's web search trail enjoys multiple kinds of user-based unique characteristics.

To unify the language and context model training, we present an approach that combines an extractor network and a domain adaptation layer. The extractor network learns a context representation from a fixed-size window of past words and provides the context information for the adaptation layer. The benefit of our method is that the extractor network can be trained jointly with the language model in a single training step.

Some of the most successful approaches have used probabilistic models to uncover latent thematic structure in discrete data. Despite the success of these models on textual data, they have not generalized as well to image data, in part because of the spatial and temporal structure that may exist in an image stream. We introduce a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that incorporates the ability of convolutional autoencoders to discover features from images that directly encode spatial information, within a Bayesian nonparametric topic model that discovers meaningful latent patterns within discrete data. By using this hybrid framework, we overcome the fundamental dependency of traditional topic models on rigidly hand-coded data representations, while simultaneously encoding spatial dependency in our topics without adding model complexity. We apply this model to the motivating application of high-level scene understanding and mission summarization for exploratory marine robots.

In general, SNMF consists of three main steps, which are, generating a word co-occurrence matrix, selecting anchor words, and recovering a topic matrix. The anchor words strongly influence the interpretability of extracted topics. In this paper, we propose a new method for selecting the anchor words by using singular value decomposition (SVD). We assume that the most dominant words in each latent semantics created by SVD are the potential candidates for the anchor words. Our simulations show that the SVD-based anchor word selection method can reach better interpretability scores of extracted topics than the common convex hull-based method on two of three datasets.","","978-1-5386-1981-0","10.1109/IALP.2017.8300600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8300600","topic modeling;separable nonnegative matrix factorization;anchor words;singular value decomposition","Matrix decomposition;Semantics;Singular value decomposition;Electronic mail;Analytical models;Data models;Mutual information","document handling;matrix decomposition;singular value decomposition","SNMF;word co-occurrence matrix;topic matrix;extracted topics;singular value decomposition;dominant words;anchor word selection method;separable nonnegative matrix factorization;topic modeling;latent semantics;SVD;interpretability scores","","1","","14","","22 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed model takes counts of a set of phytoplankton taxa in a timeseries as its training data, and models communities by learning sparse co-occurrence structure between the taxa. Our model is probabilistic, where communities are represented by probability distributions over the species, and each time-step is represented by a probability distribution over the communities. The proposed approach uses a non-parametric, spatiotemporal topic model to encourage the communities to form an interpretable representation of the data, without making strong assumptions about the communities. We demonstrate the quality and interpretability of our method by its ability to improve performance of a simplistic regression model. We show that simple linear regression is sufficient to predict the community distribution learned by our method, and therefore the taxon distributions, from a set of naively chosen environment variables. In contrast, a similar regression model is insufficient to predict the taxon distributions directly or through PCA with the same level of accuracy.","","978-0-6929-4690-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8232370","","Predictive models;Data models;Biological system modeling;Sea measurements;Training;Principal component analysis","biology computing;ecology;learning (artificial intelligence);microorganisms;regression analysis","sparse cooccurrence structure learning;similar regression model;taxon distributions;community distribution;simplistic regression model;spatiotemporal topic model;probability distribution;training data;phytoplankton taxa;probabilistic generative model;seasonal phytoplankton communities","","","","8","","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We believe that parts of speech are within the language competence of the person and are used in the process of communication, performing a certain function in the communication process. The essence of thematic modeling is seen as the creation of semantic models of the text corpus. The goal is to study the speech representation of modern movements and communities. The hypothesis is that the forums of a social movement reflect its characteristics, the nature, and activities of this movement. Three groups of the Russian social media VKontakte were chosen as an empirical object: “All for the Victory!”, “Center of (City) Volunteers of St. Petersburg,” “Volunteers of St. Petersburg.” Topic modeling was carried out using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method, implemented in the Gensim package along with the Mallet implementation. Model quality validation was carried out using the coherence coefficient.

But distressing news, e.g., COVID-19 death tolls, may trigger negative emotions in public, discouraging them from following the news, which, in turn, can limit the effectiveness of the media. To understand people’s emotional response to the COVID-19 news, we have investigated the prevalence of basic human emotions in around 19 million user responses to 1.7 million COVID-19 news posts on Twitter from (English-speaking) media across 12 countries from January 2020 to April 2021. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify news themes on Twitter. Also, the Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model was used to identify emotions in the tweets. Our analysis of the Twitter data revealed that anger was the most prevalent emotion in user responses to the news coverage of COVID-19. That was followed by sadness, optimism, and joy, steadily over the period of the study. The prevalence of anger (in user responses) was higher for the news about authorities and politics while optimism and joy were more prevalent for the news about vaccination and educational impacts of COVID-19 respectively. The prevalence of sadness in user responses, however, was the highest for the news about COVID-19 cases and deaths and the impacts on the families, mental health, jails, and nursing homes. We also observed a higher level of anger in the user responses to the (COVID-19) news posted by the USA media accounts (e.g., CNN Politics, Fox News, MSNBC). Optimism, on the other hand, was found to be the highest for Filipino media accounts.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3150329","University Global Partnership Network (UGPN) as well as the Australian Academy of Science; Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, Australian Government; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9709267","COVID-19;media;news;emotion;Twitter;RoBERTa model;topic modeling;NLP","COVID-19;Media;Social networking (online);Blogs;Emotion recognition;Emotional responses;Pandemics","behavioural sciences computing;emotion recognition;medical information systems;social networking (online)","emotional response;Twitter;emotion classification approach;COVID-19 death tolls;negative emotions;basic human emotions;user responses;COVID-19 news posts;news themes;prevalent emotion;news coverage;Fox News;robustly optimized BERT pretraining approach model;RoBERTa;LDA;Filipino media accounts","","","","71","CCBY","9 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the Russian Twitter, only a handful of works exists, and these works lack substantial discussion on topic interpretability. Also, the impact of various properties of texts upon the modelling results remains widely unexplored. We partly cover these gaps by assessing a mid-range text corpus of a conflictual Twitter discussion in two respects. In continuation to our earlier study that applied three topic modelling algorithms (LDA, WNTM, and BTM) and assessed their quality via automated means, we here juxtapose automated assessment to human coding and link the human evaluation of topic quality to sentiment of the topics. We show that human coding disagrees with the results of the objective metrics in the number of interpretable topics, showing slightly higher interpretability for the LDA algorithm, but inter-coder reliability is much higher for BTM. We discuss a range of coding issues true for all the three topic models. We also find that interpretability of a topic by the human coders is linked to presence of negative keywords among the topic descriptors, with the strongest linkage shown by BTM.","","978-1-7281-2946-4","10.1109/SNAMS.2019.8931725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8931725","topic modelling;Russian;Twitter;sentiment;LDA;BTM;WNTM;negativity","Twitter;Measurement;Biological system modeling;Encoding;Analytical models;Security","natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis","topic modelling algorithms;topic quality;interpretable topics;topic descriptors;Russian Twitter;hidden topicality;topic interpretability;mid-range text corpus;conflictual Twitter discussion;LDA algorithm;WNTM algorithm;BTM algorithm","","5","","49","","16 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider a map view composed of regular grids or tiles with each showing topic keywords from documents of the corresponding region. To this end, we present a tilebased spatio-temporally exclusive topic modeling approach called STExNMF, based on a novel nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) technique. STExNMF mainly works based on the two following stages: (1) first running a standard NMF of each tile to obtain general topics of the tile and (2) running a spatiotemporally exclusive NMF on a weighted residual matrix. These topics likely reveal information on newly emerging events or topics of interest within a region. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach using the geo-tagged Twitter data of New York City. We also provide quantitative comparisons in terms of the topic quality, spatio-temporal exclusiveness, topic variation, and qualitative evaluations of our method using several usage scenarios.

For text mining, topic modeling is a language-independent technique that disregards grammar and word order. Apart from semantic and structural issues, Thai language is typically considered more complex than others. Due to the lack of word delimiter and a surfeit of composite words. Errors from word tokenization can create significant problems for any post processes of text, such as document retrieval, sentiment analysis, machine translation, etc., adversely decreasing the performance of text applications. Despite a strong correlation between word ordering and semantic meaning, topic modeling has been widely reported that it can extract latent information, aka. latent topic or latent semantic, encoded in documents. Although there were few previous research works on studying topic modeling in Thai language, they mostly focused on upstream processes of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in, for example, applying a refined stop-word list to, or adding N-gram on a single specific topic modeling method. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to explore different topic modeling approaches, i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Nonnegative Metrix Factorization (NMF), in Thai Language to compare their coherence.

A customer can leave a comment to share their satisfaction or dissatisfaction and rate the overall experience with the product or service received. In this study, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling algorithm was used to extract the main themes in the customer feedbacks. The extracted themes revealed that food quality, service quality, speed and completeness of order are the major themes raised by the customers. Analyzing the e-WOM of the customers enables the management to gain insights into the business process, product and service. Such analysis can help provide better personalized service to improve business performance.

These methods include Principal Component Analysis, Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and KATE, a novel k-competitive autoencoder for text documents. Separately for 8-K and 10-K, the usefulness and effectiveness of these methods is evaluated by comparing their performances on two classification tasks: (i) predicting which section each document corresponds to, where we consider each section within an 8-K or 10-K filing as an individual document, and (ii) detecting text from a bank's year of failure, a task for which we use bank failure data from the 2008 financial crisis.

For example, given a large collection of documents, users may want only a smaller subset which more closely aligns with their interests, tasks, and domains. In particular, our paper focuses on large-scale document retrieval with high recall where any missed relevant documents can be critical. A simple keyword matching search is generally not effective nor efficient as 1) it is difficult to find a list of keyword queries that can cover the documents of interest before exploring the dataset, 2) some documents may not contain the exact keywords of interest but may still be highly relevant, and 3) some words have multiple meanings, which would result in irrelevant documents included in the retrieved subset. In this paper, we present TopicSifter, a visual analytics system for interactive search space reduction.

Probabilistic graphical models have shown great potential for mining such text corpora in recent years. Some of these algorithms utilize explicit annotations and labels associated with documents to guide the probabilistic model to find hidden themes. A few techniques attempt to utilize the timestamps associated with documents to model the evolution of those latent topics. However, no effort has been devoted to utilize these two different dimensions of information together — timestamps and labels or annotations — to discover evolution of labeled themes. In this paper, we present a new topical model called the Supervised Topical Evolution Model (STEM), which is a monolithic graphical model capable of using annotations, timestamps, and textual contents to discover interpretable and evolving themes from big text datasets. STEM simultaneously learns latent themes and their changes over time using a stochastic process that is driven by labels or annotations. In addition, we provide an asynchronously distributed inference process for STEM that results in significant speedup in learning time, making the model scalable for large datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model is able to infer highly interpretable topics that reflect temporal patterns, in much less time than other comparable topic modeling methods.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8257988","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8257988","Scalability;Graphical Models;Temporal Topic Modeling;Probabilistic Inference","Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic;Graphical models;Program processors;Big Data;Computer science;Social network services","Big Data;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);stochastic processes;text analysis","big text datasets;STEM;asynchronously distributed inference process;big data;labeled text data;digital publication archives;social media posts;question-answer forums;probabilistic graphical models;explicit annotations;probabilistic model;hidden themes;timestamps;labeled themes;topical model;Supervised Topical Evolution Model;monolithic graphical model;topic modeling methods;large document collections;topical evolution tracking;text corpora mining;learning time","","3","","21","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Topic models, as one of the most powerful algorithms, have been widely used to discover the latent semantic patterns in text collections. However, one key weakness of topic models is that they need documents with certain length to provide reliable statistics for generating coherent topics. In Twitter, the users' tweets are mostly short and noisy. Observations of word co-occurrences are incomprehensible for topic models. To deal with this problem, previous work tried to incorporate prior knowledge to obtain better results. However, this strategy is not practical for the fast evolving UGC in Twitter. In this paper, we first cluster the users according to the retweet network, and the users' interests are mined as the prior knowledge. Such data are then applied to improve the performance of topic learning. The potential cause for the effectiveness of this approach is that users in the same community usually share similar interests, which will result in less noisy sub-data sets. Our algorithm pre-learns two types of interest knowledge from the data set: the interest-word-sets and a tweet-interest preference matrix. Furthermore, a dedicated background model is introduced to judge whether a word is drawn from the background noise. Experiments on two real life twitter data sets show that our model achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2696558","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571331); Integrated Project for Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91218301); Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation for Young Teachers in the Higher Education Institutions of China(grant numbers:151066); Shuguang Program from the Shanghai Education Development Foundation(grant numbers:14SG20); Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan(grant numbers:16511100901); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7941989","Topic model;social network;short texts","Biological system modeling;Noise measurement;Computational modeling;Twitter;Semantics;Data mining","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;social networking (online);statistics;text analysis","coherent topic mining;prelearned interest knowledge;Twitter;semantic coherent topic discovery;user-generated content;social media;downstream applications;intelligent computing;topic models;latent semantic patterns;text collections;documents;statistics;UGC;user clustering;retweet network;user interest mining;topic learning;interest-word-sets;tweet-interest preference matrix;dedicated background model","","8","","43","OAPA","7 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But choosing two words indiscriminately to form a biterm may affect the accuracy of topic modeling, because the distinct words are not equally indicative in presenting service topics. Therefore, a SP-BTM is proposed in this paper which only chooses the words with specific parts-of-speech to form biterms for topic modeling.

Accordingly, the method can generate less important topics that are not worth analyzing. To solve this problem, we construct a hierarchical topic structure with different depths and more important topics by using Bayesian rose trees. In the experiment, the values of the hyperparameters for constructing a hierarchical topic structure are estimated by using evaluation indexes for causal analysis.

We present a novel sampler that overcomes both problems, and we show that this sampler is faster, both empirically and theoretically, than previous Gibbs samplers for LDA. We do so by employing a novel Pólya-urn-based approximation in the sparse partially collapsed sampler for LDA. We prove that the approximation error vanishes with data size, making our algorithm asymptotically exact, a property of importance for large-scale topic models. In addition, we show, via an explicit example, that-contrary to popular belief in the topic modeling literature-partially collapsed samplers can be more efficient than fully collapsed samplers.

Topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been applied to competitive analysis, which mainly use the semantic similarities between documents to infer competitive relationships. In this study, we propose using graph embedding methods to learn the implicit competitive relationships between firms. Using patent networks with patents and organizations as nodes, we learn the embeddings of nodes which are then used to cluster organizations into groups. Organizations within the same groups are considered competitors. We applied three graph embedding methods: node2vec, metapath2vec, and GraphSAGE to learn node embeddings. Two of these methods use the structural information in patent networks: node2vec for homogeneous networks and metapath2vec for heterogeneous networks. While, GraphSAGE uses both the structure and content information in the patent network. The results are compared with a baseline author-topic modeling method.

Existing approaches for this task focused mainly on how to extract features from motion capture data to achieve high recognition performance. However, due to the presence of redundant features and the high dimensionality of data, these approaches may not achieve the optimal performance. In order to rapidly and accurately recognize human motion, we present a novel method based on topic model and SVM. It consists of first extracting informative angle features at each frame of motion sequence, which is helpful to eliminate redundant information. Then, significant motion frames are transformed into motion-words to form motion sequences. A motion sequence is a combination of motion-words, which are obtained by extracting key poses and applying hierarchical clustering. Then, topic model are applied to obtain the underlying topic distribution to perform motion recognition. We studied 9 common motions for 13 subjects. The results show the best recognition accuracy achieves 98.41% which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","","978-1-5090-4179-4","10.1109/BHI.2017.7897233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7897233","","Feature extraction;Training;Support vector machines;Real-time systems;Thigh;Sensors;Legged locomotion","image sequences;motion estimation;pose estimation;real-time systems;support vector machines","hierarchical clustering;key pose extraction;motion words combination;motion sequence;informative angle features;recognition performance;feature extraction;motion capture data;SVM;topic model;real-time human motion recognition system","","1","","19","","25 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For a mobile app, it would be increasingly challenging to stand out from the enormous competitors and become prevalent among users. Good user experience and well-designed functionalities are the keys to a successful app. To achieve this, popular apps usually schedule their updates frequently. If we can capture the critical app issues faced by users in a timely and accurate manner, developers can make timely updates, and good user experience can be ensured. There exist prior studies on analyzing reviews for detecting emerging app issues. These studies are usually based on topic modeling or clustering techniques. However, the short-length characteristics and sentiment of user reviews have not been considered. In this paper, we propose a novel emerging issue detection approach named MERIT to take into consideration the two aforementioned characteristics. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Online Biterm Sentiment-Topic (AOBST) model for jointly modeling topics and corresponding sentiments that takes into consideration app versions. Based on the AOBST model, we infer the topics negatively reflected in user reviews for one app version, and automatically interpret the meaning of the topics with most relevant phrases and sentences. Experiments on popular apps from Google Play and Apple's App Store demonstrate the effectiveness of MERIT in identifying emerging app issues, improving the state-of-the-art method by 22.3 percent in terms of F1-score.

Many large-scale LDA training systems have been developed, which usually prefer a customized design from top to bottom with sophisticated synchronization support. We propose an LDA training system named ZenLDA, which follows a generalized design for the distributed data-parallel platform. The novelty of ZenLDA consists of three main aspects: (1) it converts the commonly used serial Collapsed Gibbs Sampling (CGS) inference algorithm to a Monte-Carlo Collapsed Bayesian (MCCB) estimation method, which is embarrassingly parallel; (2) it decomposes the LDA inference formula into parts that can be sampled more efficiently to reduce computation complexity; (3) it proposes a distributed LDA training framework, which represents the corpus as a directed graph with the parameters annotated as corresponding vertices and implements ZenLDA and other well-known inference methods based on Spark. Experimental results indicate that MCCB converges with accuracy similar to that of CGS, while running much faster. On top of MCCB, the ZenLDA formula decomposition achieved the fastest speed among other well-known inference methods. ZenLDA also showed good scalability when dealing with large-scale topic models on the data-parallel platform. Overall, ZenLDA could achieve comparable and even better computing performance with state-of-the-art dedicated systems.","2096-0654","","10.26599/BDMA.2018.9020006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8268736","latent Dirichlet allocation;collapsed Gibbs sampling;Monte-Carlo;graph computing;large-scale machine learning","Sparks;Training;Inference algorithms;Computational modeling;Bayes methods;Big Data;Data mining","Bayes methods;computational complexity;data mining;directed graphs;inference mechanisms;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);Monte Carlo methods;parallel processing;sampling methods","distributed data-parallel platform;CGS;Monte-Carlo Collapsed Bayesian estimation method;MCCB;LDA inference formula;distributed LDA training framework;ZenLDA formula decomposition;large-scale topic model training;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;large-scale web mining;large-scale LDA training systems;LDA training system;ZenLDA;serial Collapsed Gibbs Sampling inference algorithm;computation complexity","","2","","","","25 Jan 2018","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Knowledge about the diffusion's direction into application fields, which have not yet completely been exploited, may help technology managers and scholars to better understand the evolution of the RFID technology. Recent methods are either characterized by high manual efforts or miss the opportunity to directly identify emerging application fields. This leads to the question, which method is suitable for examining a technology's diffusion in a time-oriented and highly automated manner. In this paper, dynamic topic modeling (DTM) is applied for this purpose. Using the same RFID patent data set as in earlier publications, we create a term-document matrix. Subsequent to this, we carry out DTM and thus retrieve relevant topics which represent application fields. Additionally, we identify dynamic shifts in the application fields. Finally, we make a comparison between DTM and topic modeling in particular. We conclude that DTM is more appropriate for measuring the diffusion of a technology into an application field than earlier methods. Apart from generating an overview of application fields, DTM enables the observation of term dynamics in the application fields, and is therefore suitable for managers and scholars interested in technology diffusion.","2159-5100","978-1-890843-39-7","10.23919/PICMET.2019.8893914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8893914","","Vehicle dynamics;Atmospheric modeling;Medical services;Logistics;Finance;Authentication","document handling;natural language processing;patents;radiofrequency identification","RFID technology;dynamic topic modeling;DTM;technology diffusion;radio-frequency identification;RFID patent data set;term-document matrix","","","","25","","7 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While some technologies spread quickly across an entire market, other technologies are first established in one market segment, and then move on to further segments. Knowledge about the diffusion of a technology can help managers with their assessment and is therefore of major importance. Recently, [1] suggested a method to measure diffusion by means of an informetric approach, namely the tf-lag-idf. Nevertheless, shortcomings such as a high degree of manual effort and subjective coding decrease the reliability of this method. As an alternative, we develop a method based on topic modeling in accordance with [2] and test our method by using the same dataset as [1]. Applying our method to the case of RFID technology produces application fields such as logistics, payment & finance, or medicine.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide gold standard data for learning ITRs not subject to confounding bias. However, RCTs are often conducted under stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria, and participants in RCTs may not reflect the general patient population. Thus, ITRs learned from RCTs lack generalizability to the broader real world patient population. Real world databases such as electronic health records (EHRs) provide new resources as complements to RCTs to facilitate evidence-based research for personalized medicine. However, to ensure the validity of ITRs learned from EHRs, a number of challenges including confounding bias and selection bias must be addressed. In this work, we propose a matching-based machine learning method to estimate optimal individualized treatment rules from EHRs using interpretable features extracted from EHR documentation of medications and ICD diagnoses codes. We use a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to extract latent topics and weights as features for learning ITRs. Our method achieves confounding reduction in observational studies through matching treated and untreated individuals and improves treatment optimization by augmenting feature space with clinically meaningful LDA-based features. We apply the method to EHR data collected at New York Presbyterian Hospital clinical data warehouse in studying optimal second-line treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. We use cross validation to show that ITRs outperforms uniform treatment strategies (i.e., assigning same treatment to all individuals), and including topic modeling features leads to more reduction of post-treatment complications.","","978-1-7281-4493-1","10.1109/DSAA.2019.00054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8964204","precision medicine;real world evidence;electronic health records;individualized treatment rule;machine learning;matching;latent Dirichlet allocation","","data warehouses;diseases;electronic health records;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;patient treatment","patient response;chronic disorders;precision medicine;tailor treatments;LDA-based features;stringent inclusion-exclusion criteria;substantial heterogeneity;topic modeling feature extraction;personalized treatment rules;post-treatment complications;uniform treatment strategies;type 2 diabetes patients;second-line treatment;New York Presbyterian Hospital clinical data warehouse;EHR data;feature space;treatment optimization;latent Dirichlet allocation model;optimal individualized treatment rules;matching-based machine;selection bias;personalized medicine;evidence-based research;electronic health records;world databases;RCTs lack generalizability;general patient population;confounding bias;randomized controlled trials;patient-specific characteristics","","1","","33","","23 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet high-quality topic modeling is becoming increasingly challenging because accurate models require large amounts of training data typically owned by multiple parties, who are often unwilling to share their sensitive data for collaborative training without guarantees on their data privacy. To enable effective privacy-preserving multiparty topic modeling, we propose a novel federated general-purpose topic model named private and consistent topic discovery (PC-TD). On the one hand, PC-TD seamlessly integrates differential privacy in topic modeling to provide privacy guarantees on sensitive data of different parties.

To help researchers more quickly reveal the complex relationships existing between diabetes mellitus, obesity, and related diseases in the literature, and give them an inspiration to search the effective treatments for these diseases, we propose a novel model named as representative latent Dirichlet allocation topic model (RLDA). We conducted the representation learning model on more than 337,000 pieces of diabetes and obesity related literature published in the recent decade. Then, an explicit analysis of the final result using a series of visualization tools to discover meaningful relations among diabetes mellitus, obesity, and other diseases was performed. In order to show the credibility of our discoveries, we used clinical reports, such as Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, which were not used in our training data, to verify our results. Fortunately, a sufficient number of the reports were direct matches. With the help of our model, we achieved satisfactory results for diabetes mellitus and obesity. For example, we discovered that 22 other diseases are closely related to diabetes mellitus, 10 with obesity and 8 with both. In addition, the tumor, adolescent/child, inflammation, and hypertension will be the hottest research topics relating to diabetes and obesity in the near future. We believe that the representational learning model we have built can help biomedical researchers direct the focus and adjust the direction of their work.","","978-1-5090-3050-7","10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8217785","diabetes mellitus;obesity;RLDA;topic model;representation learning","Diabetes;Obesity;Diseases;Clustering algorithms;Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Resource management","data mining;diseases;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;patient treatment;text analysis","diabetes mellitus;representative latent Dirichlet allocation topic model;representation learning model;hotspot analysis;relation discovery;obesity;RLDA;Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes;tumor topic;adolescent topic;child topic;inflammation topic;hypertension topic","","1","","35","","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The task can be tackled with different machine learning approaches. In this paper, we use the unsupervised learning approach to determine those students with higher effectiveness and no preparation of other labeled data sets. In this approach, a temporal cluster analysis method is proposed in our work based on the temporal clusters returned by dynamic topic models. In addition, we consider temporal characteristics in the study performance of each student to form a pattern from the temporal clusters he/she belongs to over the time. Similar students share similar patterns and therefore, allowing us to determine the pattern types of in-trouble students and recognize them more accurately. In an evaluation study, experimental results show that our method outperforms the other unsupervised and supervised learning methods with higher Recall and F-measure values.

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model named tpLDA, which incorporates different levels of topic popularity information to determine the prior LDA distribution, discover the latent topics and achieve better clustering. Specifically, global topic popularity is introduced to reduce the potential distraction in local cluster popularity and the local cluster popularity draws more attention on certain parts of the global topic popularity. The two popularities contribute complementary information and their integration can dynamically adjust statistical parameters of the model.

Although they definitely boost service clustering via mining more implicit topics and semantic correlation of service document, their performance still can be improved due to inherent disadvantage of LDA topic model and adopted clustering algorithms. To address this problem, we propose a Web services clustering method based on HDP topic model and SOM neural network.

At last, it employs SOM algorithm on the document-topic vector to achieve Web services clustering. The comparative experiments are performed on ProgrammableWeb dataset.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), now opens avenues for extraction of open-ended responses. In this paper, we analyze the potential of LDA in open-ended responses, by comparing with closed-ended counterpart options. A questionnaire designed based on Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), is used to collect information on the intentions to use shared autonomous mobility. Two versions of the questionnaire were used, that alternately allow for open- and closed-ended versions of the same questions. Factor analysis was used to construct factors from the Likert scale questions and LDA was used to extract information from open-ended questions. Ordered Probit models were estimated to predict the intention to use shared autonomous mobility services. Attitudes, socio-demographics and current travel behavior of individuals were used in the model. The questionnaire instrument played an important decision in an individual's decision to use the proposed service.

GPU-based systems have emerged as a promising alternative because of their high computational power and memory bandwidth. However, existing GPU-based LDA systems can only learn thousands of topics, because they use dense data structures, and have linear time complexity to the number of topics.

In terms of expectation construction, this method does not consider setting an approximate distribution for the posterior distribution of topic variables, and in the aspect of programming solution, a large number of partial derivative operations are required, which makes it difficult to analyze the convergence of the algorithm. In this paper, a keyword extraction method combining random walk and variational inference is proposed. The variational parameter distribution is set to estimate the posterior distribution of topic variables, and the random walk state transition matrix is used to iteratively calculate the parameters instead of Lagrange function. Not only can it be proved theoretically that this method has a stable distribution, but also through comparative experiments, it is proved that this method is superior to the ordinary EM algorithm in three evaluation metrics:precision, recall and F1 Measure, and its performance is not easily affected by the change of the number of extracted words.","","978-1-6654-2186-7","10.1109/ICAICE54393.2021.00034","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61803035); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9797477","keyword extraction;topic model;EM algorithm;variational inference;random walk","Vocabulary;Parameter estimation;Computational modeling;Semantics;Programming;Approximation algorithms;Inference algorithms","information retrieval;iterative methods;matrix algebra;natural language processing;parameter estimation;random processes;text analysis","keyword extraction method;variational inference;text semantic information;topic model;parameter estimation algorithm;mapping relationship;topic space;text space;model parameters;expectation maximization algorithm;logarithmic likelihood function;topic variables;target expectation;Lagrange multiplier method;expectation construction;approximate distribution;posterior distribution;variational parameter distribution;random walk state transition matrix;Lagrange function;stable distribution;extracted words","","","","35","IEEE","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To obtain better user clustering performance, we propose two user collaborative interest tracking models that aim at tracking changes of each user's dynamic topic distributions in collaboration with their followees' dynamic topic distributions, based both on the content of current short texts and the previously estimated distributions. Our models can be either short-term or long-term dependency topic models. Short-term dependency model collaboratively tracks users' interests based on users' topic distributions at the previous time period only, whereas long-term dependency model collaboratively tracks users' interests based on users' topic distributions at multiple time periods in the past. We also propose two collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithms for collaboratively inferring users' dynamic interests for their clustering in our short-term and long-term dependency topic models, respectively.

Moreover, suggesting events for a group of users also has not been well studied. In this paper, we first discover the correlation between organizer and textual content, i.e., the events held by the same organizer tend to have more similar content. Based on this observation, we present a content-venue-aware topic model (CVTM) to capture group interests on an event from two perspectives: content and venue. The correlation between organizer and content is modeled in CVTM to alleviate the sparsity of textual content, and then we can further extract group interests on content of an event more accurately. Finally, a group event recommendation method using CVTM is proposed. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the recommendation performance of our model on two real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods that suggest upcoming events for groups.

We then applied topic modeling to identify topics and analyze topic similarities/differences in these six datasets. Word clouds and histograms were used to depict the distribution of vocabularies over each topic in which the most prevalent words conveyed a topic’s meaning. TreeMap and trend analysis were performed to fingerprint abstracts and explore the prevalent topic dynamics in the POU-related literature.

Proliferation of data in the web and social media has posed significant challenges in finding relevant information efficiently even using those search engines or other software systems. Moreover, those systems or engines tend to collect large number of data, which could be useful for end users in various ways but have overlooked the meaning of the search phrases, hence generate irrelevant search results. A unit level searching i.e. searching information within a website or page is also not effective as they follow exact keyword matching techniques and ignore the semantic level matching of search phrases. In order to address those deficiencies, this research proposes a hybrid approach which use the semantics of data, community preferences as well as collaborative filtering techniques for semantic information retrieval. More specifically, Topic modeling based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation together with topic-driven based community detection methods are applied for identifying personalized search results generation and hence improve the relatedness of the research results. Based on the proposed hybrid approach a framework for semantic search that can easily be integrated to a software application has been implemented.

However, social tags have several unique characteristics, i.e., sparseness and data coupling (i.e., non-IIDness), which makes existing text analysis methods such as LDA not directly applicable. In this paper, we propose a new generative algorithm for social tag analysis named joint latent Dirichlet allocation, which models the generation of tags based on both the users and the objects, and thus accounts for the coupling relationships among social tags. The model introduces two latent factors that jointly influence tag generation: the user's latent interest factor and the object's latent topic factor, formulated as user-topic distribution matrix and object-topic distribution matrix, respectively. A Gibbs sampling approach is adopted to simultaneously infer the above two matrices as well as a topic-word distribution matrix. Experimental results on four social tagging datasets have shown that our model is able to capture more reasonable topics and achieves better performance than five state-of-the-art topic models in terms of the widely used point-wise mutual information metric. In addition, we analyze the learnt topics showing that our model recovers more themes from social tags while LDA may lead the topic vanishing problems, and demonstrate its advantages in the social recommendation by evaluating the retrieval results with mean reciprocal rank metric. Finally, we explore the joint procedure of our model in depth to show the non-IID characteristic of social tagging process.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2017.2716829","High Technology Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2015AA015801); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61221001); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:12DZ2272600); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7950936","Joint latent dirichlet allocation;non-IID learning;social tags;structure mining;topic models","Analytical models;Semantics;Tagging;Visualization;Resource management;Data models;Measurement","information retrieval;meta data;recommender systems;sampling methods;semantic networks;social networking (online);statistical distributions;text analysis","joint latent Dirichlet allocation;social tags;social tag analysis;influence tag generation;user-topic distribution matrix;object-topic distribution matrix;topic-word distribution matrix;social tagging datasets;state-of-the-art topic models;social tagging process;LDA;retrieval result evaluation;point-wise mutual information metric;Gibbs sampling;semantic metadata;text analysis;social recommendation","","17","","52","IEEE","16 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, our goal is to solve the new problem of user-specific web search analysis. We go beyond click graph and propose two probabilistic topic models, Topic Independence Model(TIM) and Topic Dependence Model (TDM). TIM adopts an assumption that the generation of query terms and URLs are topically independent; TDM captures the coupling between search queries and URLs. We also capture the temporal burstiness of topics by utilizing the continuous Beta distribution. Through a large-scale analysis of a real-life search query log, we observe that each user's web search trail enjoys multiple kinds of user-based unique characteristics.

Unlike most medical treatments, its primary mechanisms are linguistic; i.e., the treatment relies directly on a conversation between a patient and provider. However, the evaluation of patient-provider conversation suffers from critical shortcomings, including intensive labor requirements, coder error, nonstandardized coding systems, and inability to scale up to larger data sets. To overcome these shortcomings, psychotherapy analysis needs a reliable and scalable method for summarizing the content of treatment encounters. We used a publicly available psychotherapy corpus from Alexander Street press comprising a large collection of transcripts of patient-provider conversations to compare coding performance for two machine learning methods. We used the labeled latent Dirichlet allocation (L-LDA) model to learn associations between text and codes, to predict codes in psychotherapy sessions, and to localize specific passages of within-session text representative of a session code. We compared the L-LDA model to a baseline lasso regression model using predictive accuracy and model generalizability (measured by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic curve). The L-LDA model outperforms the lasso logistic regression model at predicting session-level codes with average AUC scores of 0.79, and 0.70, respectively. For fine-grained level coding, L-LDA and logistic regression are able to identify specific talk-turns representative of symptom codes. However, model performance for talk-turn identification is not yet as reliable as human coders. We conclude that the L-LDA model has the potential to be an objective, scalable method for accurate automated coding of psychotherapy sessions that perform better than comparable discriminative methods at session-level coding and can also predict fine-grained codes.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2503985","National Institutes of Health; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)(grant numbers:R01/AA018673); National Institute on Drug Abuse(grant numbers:R34/DA034860); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7337368","Clinical communication;conversation analysis;labeled latent Dirichlet allocation (L-LDA);machine learning;multilabel document classification","Encoding;Predictive models;Medical treatment;Informatics;Resource management;Computational modeling;Logistics","biomedical communication;encoding;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;patient treatment;psychology;regression analysis;text analysis","content coding;psychotherapy transcripts;labeled topic models;medical interventions;medical treatments;patient-provider conversation;nonstandardized coding systems;data sets;psychotherapy corpus;Alexander Street press;machine learning;labeled latent Dirichlet allocation;text-code associations;within-session text;L-LDA model;baseline lasso regression model;area under-the curve;lasso logistic regression model;session-level codes;average AUC scores;fine-grained level coding;specific talk-turns representative;symptom codes;talk-turn identification","Algorithms;Clinical Coding;Electronic Health Records;Humans;Interdisciplinary Communication;Machine Learning;Psychotherapy;Semantics","15","","43","IEEE","25 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In a variety of ways, topic modelling approaches have been used to analyze and model source codes. Using various statistical techniques and methodologies, several pieces of research have been done to extract topics from source codes. Attempts to extract topics from method names, identifiers, and comments are the most common. These topic extraction approaches are interdependent, and if software best practices aren't followed in older systems, it might cause chaos. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, the authors have conducted a study on extracting source code using a JavaParser and predicting the source code functionality name through the artificial neural network model. It shows an average accuracy of 88 percent semantic function prediction rate. This is a new approach for topic modelling and the first attempt in building an artificially intelligent model to predict the semantic function name of the source code.","","978-1-6654-8325-4","10.1109/FITI54902.2021.9833070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9833070","Source Codes;Java Parser;Topic Modelling;Software Reuse;Artificial Neural Network","Chaos;Analytical models;Technological innovation;Codes;Semantics;Buildings;Predictive models","Java;neural nets;pattern classification;program diagnostics;software maintenance;software reusability","topic modelling;JavaParser;source code extraction;software reusability;topic extraction;outdated source code;software development;software maintainability;source code classification;neural network-based approach;artificial neural network model;source code functionality name","","","","26","IEEE","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a solution framework to infer road network maps with high quality and efficiency. The key of our map inference is to divide map extent into smaller cells and maintain a binary cell-trajectory matrix. The binary matrix determines whether or not a trajectory passes a cell. We infer the importance of each cell from the matrix using a popular topic model (e.g., LDA [13] and pLSA [8]). Based on such computed importance, we next infer representative points and road segments to derive a road network map. Our extensive experiments on real data sets verify that the proposed inference algorithm can achieve higher map quality and meanwhile 1.5 ×, 6.8 × and 280 × shorter running time, when compared with three state of the arts including three representative work [4], [7], [14].","2375-0324","978-1-5386-3932-0","10.1109/MDM.2017.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7962459","","Roads;Trajectory;Global Positioning System;Inference algorithms;Databases;Computational modeling;Noise measurement","cartography;inference mechanisms;smart phones;traffic engineering computing","topic model-based road network inference;massive trajectories;mobile devices;smart phones;vehicle networks;wearable watches;trajectory data;map inference;high map quality;computation efficiency;binary cell-trajectory matrix;road segments;road network map","","4","","23","","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of opinion mining in the field of big data is used for categorizing the opinions of people or customers into different sentiments and to evaluate the mood of the customers. Opinion mining has gained significant importance over time due to the steep increase in amount of opinions available online. People share their opinions on products, services, movies, restaurants, schools, hospitals, holiday destinations etc. Social media has made it simple for users to share their opinion and make it available for any person on the Internet. The companies improve their strategy, products, marketing and services in order to detect latest trends and opportunities or to gauge how effective their marketing is. Several research attempts are being made at sentiment analysis to detect sentiment polarity and to perform predictive analytic. It is a research field which uses computer science and psychology. Natural Language Processing studies how machines can be used to comprehend a language and make it do meaningful things. The process of collecting public opinion and analyzing huge amount of social data has drawn great importance because of its real time behavior. A real time McDonald's dataset has been used for this work to determine the positive, negative and neutral reviews about the policies followed or violated by the restaurant. The people have posted their reviews as feedback of the service provided at McDonalds. McDonald's gets an enormous amount of customer comments on their website daily. Their employees don't have time to read every single comment, but they do want to read a subset of comments that they are most interested in. In particular, the media has recently portrayed their employees as being rude, and so they want to review comments about rude service. The objective of this workis to analyze every review of the user and classify if it is positive, negative or neutral in nature, which is called as opinion mining, using Machine Learning algorithms. Furthermore, topic modeling is done on the customer's reviews on the McDonald's services using LDA to find the frequently mentioned topics in their reviews. The classification of the emotions in the reviews are happy, sad, angry etc.","2575-7288","978-1-7281-5197-7","10.1109/ICACCS48705.2020.9074428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9074428","","Data models;Adaptation models;Social network services;Urban areas;Training;Data mining;Testing","data mining;hotel industry;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;psychology;review sites;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","opinion mining;food services;topic modeling;machine learning algorithms;social media;social data;McDonalds services;emotions classification;review comments;sentiment analysis;natural language processing;marketing;Web site;Big Data;Internet;restaurant","","2","","15","","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we apply a clustering method known from the area of topic modeling and usually used to find out what topics are included in a collection of text documents. In our approach, counters are treated as words and a group of counter readings at a point in time is treated as a document.

Crowd-based elicitation has great potential for engaging with (potential) users early on but also results in large sets of raw and unstructured feedback. Consolidating and analyzing this feedback is a key challenge for turning it into sensible user requirements. In this paper, we focus on topic modeling as a means to identify topics within a large set of crowd-generated user stories and compare three approaches: (1) a traditional approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, (2) a combination of word embeddings and principal component analysis, and (3) a combination of word embeddings and Word Mover's Distance. We evaluate the approaches on a publicly available set of 2,966 user stories written and categorized by crowd workers. We found that a combination of word embeddings and Word Mover's Distance is most promising. Depending on the word embeddings we use in our approaches, we manage to cluster the user stories in two ways: one that is closer to the original categorization and another that allows new insights into the dataset, e.g. to find potentially new categories. Unfortunately, no measure exists to rate the quality of our results objectively. Still, our findings provide a basis for future work towards analyzing crowd-sourced user stories.","","978-1-7281-8352-7","10.1109/AIRE51212.2020.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9233031","Requirements Engineering;Crowd-sourcing;Clustering;Machine Learning;NLP","Semantics;Feature extraction;Smart homes;Computer architecture;Resource management;Syntactics;Software","principal component analysis;software engineering","crowd-generated user stories;sensible user requirements;unstructured feedback;raw feedback;crowd-based elicitation;crowd-based techniques;requirements elicitation;topic modeling;crowd-sourced user stories;word movers distance;word embeddings;crowd workers;publicly available set","","","","45","IEEE","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes a case study where we perform an exploratory data analysis of manufacturing sensor data by using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as a tool to discover remarkable change patterns. Our target is a set of time-series data originating from the sensors installed in a closed factory environment. Each sensor gives a different type of measurement of the same manufacturing process, which is operated repeatedly in a lot-by-lot manner. We first discretize the data based on the histogram of sensor measurements and construct a bag-of-words representation. We then apply LDA to discover change patterns across tens of thousands of lots. When we apply LDA to natural language documents, the resulting topics are widely different from each other because the documents intrinsically show considerable diversity. In contrast, our data, which come from the repeatedly operated manufacturing process, only show limited diversity. As a result, LDA provides topics closely similar to each other. Our main and unexpected finding is that the difference between similar topics is useful in discovering remarkable change patterns. We performed an experiment over the data sets containing sensor measurements collected in the factory. The results have revealed that subtle difference between very similar topics often corresponds to an interesting change pattern of sensor measurements.","2375-9259","978-1-7281-4896-0","10.1109/ICDMW.2019.00064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8955572","Sensors;Data-analysis;Text-mining","Data analysis;Data models;Production facilities;Proposals;Natural languages;Manufacturing;Semiconductor device measurement","data mining;manufacturing data processing;natural language processing;text analysis;time series","sensor measurements;sensor data analysis;topic modeling;exploratory data analysis;time-series data;repeatedly operated manufacturing process;latent Dirichlet allocation;LDA;bag-of-words representation","","","","13","","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tag recommendation for text resource can be modeled as a keyword extraction problem, hence topic modeling such as LDA which extracts latent semantic topics from text is suitable for tag recommendation. However, latent topics are too coarse-grained to describe resource. Meanwhile, LDA trains corpus globally without considering context information. Besides, topics generated are difficult to be quantifiably represented. These problems lead to the poor quality of tag recommendation in topic model based method. In this paper, we propose topic representation method, which introduces embedding semantic representation into topic model.

Existing works are mainly based on raw speed sensing data obtained from infrastructure sensors or probe vehicles, which, however, are limited by expensive cost of sensor deployment and maintenance. With sparse speed observations, traditional methods based only on speed sensing data are insufficient, especially when emergencies like traffic accidents occur. To address the issue, this paper aims to improve the road traffic speed prediction by fusing traditional speed sensing data with new-type “sensing” data from cross domain sources, such as tweet sensors from social media and trajectory sensors from map and traffic service platforms. Jointly modeling information from different datasets brings many challenges, including location uncertainty of low-resolution data, language ambiguity of traffic description in texts, and heterogeneity of cross-domain data. In response to these challenges, we present a unified probabilistic framework, called Topic-Enhanced Gaussian Process Aggregation Model (TEGPAM), consisting of three components, i.e., location disaggregation model, traffic topic model, and traffic speed Gaussian Process model, which integrate new-type data with traditional data.

Instead, most such systems are limited to utilizing a fixed, initial set of topics. Motivated by this gap in the literature, we propose a novel interaction technique called TopicLens that allows a user to dynamically explore data through a lens interface where topic modeling and the corresponding 2D embedding are efficiently computed on the fly. To support this interaction in real time while maintaining view consistency, we propose a novel efficient topic modeling method and a semi-supervised 2D embedding algorithm. Our work is based on improving state-of-the-art methods such as nonnegative matrix factorization and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Furthermore, we have built a web-based visual analytics system integrated with TopicLens. We use this system to measure the performance and the visualization quality of our proposed methods.

Rooted in natural information processing, the use of the probabilistic topic model (PTM) to capture latent topics to represent HSR images has been an effective way to bridge the semantic gap. However, how to effectively discover discriminative information to recognize the HSR scenes is a challenging task. In this paper, the sparse homogeneous-heterogeneous topic feature model (SHHTFM) is proposed for HSR image scene classification. Differing from the conventional PTM-based scene classification methods, which utilize only heterogeneous features, SHHTFM explores the effect of the homogeneous information. Based on the union of uniform grid sampling and simple linear iterative clustering superpixel sampling, SHHTFM exploits both the heterogeneous and homogeneous information. After separately mining different types of low-level features and latent topics, the sparse topic inference procedure of SHHTFM further improves the fusion of the sparse heterogeneous and homogeneous topics. In addition, multisource geographical data are effectively integrated, where the water and vegetation boundaries define a more accurate way to restrict the boundaries of different scenes, and are then combined with the road network data to further improve the scene annotation performance. This provides more reliable and applicable results for us to better understand the complex scenes. The experimental results obtained with two HSR image classification data sets and an HSR image annotation data set demonstrate that the proposed SHHTFM framework can solve the scene classification problem, with a high classification accuracy as well as a high time efficiency.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2781712","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0504202); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41622107,41771385,41371344); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province in China(grant numbers:2016CFA029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8288819","Geographical;high spatial resolution (HSR) imagery;homogeneous topics;multisource;probabilistic topic model (PTM);scene classification;scene understanding","Feature extraction;Visualization;Semantics;Roads;Remote sensing;Image segmentation;Training","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image fusion;image segmentation;inference mechanisms;iterative methods;probability","sparse topic inference procedure;heterogeneous information;homogeneous information;heterogeneous features;scene classification methods;HSR image scene classification;SHHTFM;HSR scenes;latent topics;probabilistic topic model;natural information processing;high spatial resolution imagery scene classification;sparse homogeneous-heterogeneous topic feature model;high classification accuracy;scene classification problem;HSR image annotation data;HSR image classification data sets;complex scenes;scene annotation performance","","42","","46","IEEE","9 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, a typical user may find it difficult to identify a topic of interest due to the overwhelming amount of review information. To deal with this issue, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model can be used to associate meaningful terms with text-based reviews, permitting keyword retrieval of individual documents. LDA is a powerful unsupervised learning approach, which has been widely used for topic modeling as well as in other related fields. A conventional implementation of LDA is through the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo methodology, called Collapsed Gibbs Sampling (CGS). However, due to the usage of random numbers in the CGS approach, results from multiple trials on the same data are usually inconsistent. To avoid this tendency, we revise the conventional LDA approach using Variational Gibbs Sampling (VGS). VGS eliminates random numbers, and thus leads to consistent results as well as better performance. Our case study shows that our improved LDA can be used to automatically identify keywords and topics in online hospital reviews. Due to the usage of VGS, the accuracy of topic identification has been consistently improved.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8258417","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8258417","hospital reviews;text mining;Gibbs sampling;latent Dirichlet allocation;topic modeling;big data","Hospitals;Probabilistic logic;Unsupervised learning;Data models;Semantics;Resource management;Supervised learning","electronic commerce;hospitals;information retrieval;Markov processes;medical information systems;Monte Carlo methods;random processes;text analysis;unsupervised learning;Web sites","Latent Dirichlet Allocation model;text-based reviews;topic modeling;Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo methodology;random numbers;CGS approach;Variational Gibbs Sampling;VGS;online hospital reviews;topic identification;automatic topic discovery;e-commerce websites;online reviews;unsupervised learning approach;LDA approach;Collapsed Gibbs Sampling;keyword retrieval","","1","","17","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite asynchronous service invocations and distributed executions can provide better user experience, our views are blurred by out-of-order and fragmented service logs. Researchers have been trying various methods to reveal emerging service orchestration patterns, but nearly all of them have taken deterministic approaches. Hence, they do not natively cater for incomplete data and noises. In this paper, we propose to address these problems by using topic models aiming to reveal service orchestration patterns from sparse service logs. Probabilistic approaches do not only tolerate data defects, but their associated approximation methods also overcome combinatorial explosion. We first investigate the implications of sparsity on topic models. Secondly, we propose an extended time-series form of susceptible-infectious-recovered model to monitor the dynamics of emerging service orchestrations. We quantify their emerging-potential by estimated effective-reproduction-number, which is obtained incrementally by Bayesian parameter estimations. Guided by our proposed emerging-potential measure, one can profile and categorize emerging service orchestration patterns, and generate automated alerts on upcoming consumption peaks. In practice, our model enables service providers to better allocate their resources to meet demands dynamically. While our findings affirm that biterm topic model can be applied to service logs with short and sparse log entries, the effectiveness of our proposed monitoring solutions is also shown by experiments.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2015.2511000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7362237","Web services orchestration;topic model;SIR model;data sparsity problem","Mathematical model;Web services;Monitoring;Business;Probabilistic logic;Data models","data mining;probability;Web services","web services;asynchronous service invocations;fragmented service logs;emerging service orchestration patterns;sparse service logs;susceptible-infectious-recovered model;biterm topic model;service orchestration discovery","","3","","64","IEEE","22 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Additionally, we use pre-trained fastText aligned word vectors to cluster similar phrases even if they are written in different languages. The goal is to produce topic word and phrase representatives that are easy to interpret by a domain expert. We compare the method with traditional LDA and two state-of-the-art algorithms: BTM and WNTM. The resulting keyphrases representing topics are more intuitive to the domain experts than the ones obtained by reference topic models in similar experimental settings.","2375-9259","978-1-7281-9012-9","10.1109/ICDMW51313.2020.00088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9346328","Topic Modelling;LDA;healthy aging;short texts;open-ended survey responses","Coherence;Manuals;Probabilistic logic;Real-time systems;Data models;Task analysis;Mutual information","data mining;graph theory;health care;information retrieval;natural language processing;pattern clustering;text analysis","domain expert;phrase representatives;topic word;cluster similar phrases;pre-trained fastText aligned word vectors;keyphrase retrieval;open-ended survey items;topic discovery;standardized structure;free text;NLP methods;labour-intensive human effort;manual processing;research surveys;healthy aging open-ended survey questions;phrase embeddings;centroid distance;graph-based topic extraction;reference topic models","","","","38","","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many methods have been proposed to identify influential users in OSNs. PageRank and HITs are two well known examples that determine influential users through link analysis. In recent years, new models that consider both content and social network links have been developed. The Hub and Authority Topic (HAT) model is one that extends HITS to identify topic-specific hubs and authorities by jointly learning hubs, authorities, and topical interests from users' relationship and textual content. However, many of the previous works are confined to identifying influential users within a single OSN. These models, when applied to multiple OSNs, could not learn influential users under a common set of topics nor address platform preferences. In this paper, we therefore propose the MPHAT model, an extension of HAT, to jointly model the topic-specific hub users, authority users, their topical interests and platform preferences. We evaluate MPHAT against several existing state-of-the-art methods in three tasks: (i) modeling of topics, (ii) platform choice prediction, and (iii) link recommendation. Based on our extensive experiments in multiple OSNs settings using synthetic datasets and real-world datasets from Twitter and Instagram, we show that MPHAT is comparable to state-of-the-art topic models in learning topics but outperforms the state-of-the-art models in platform prediction and link recommendation tasks. We also empirically demonstrate the ability of MPHAT to determine influential users within and across multiple OSNs.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2019.2922962","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8736791","Hub;authority;topic model;online social networks","Twitter;Analytical models;Knowledge engineering;Data engineering;Task analysis;Predictive models","multimedia Web sites;social networking (online)","platform prediction;Instagram;Twitter;real-world datasets;synthetic datasets;link recommendation;platform choice prediction;MPHAT model;textual content;user relationship;hub and authority topic model;link analysis;HITs;PageRank;online social networks;OSN;authority users;topic-specific hub users;topical interests;social network links;influential users;hidden topical hubs","","2","","56","IEEE","14 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The performance metrics include safety, timeliness, efficiency, and cleanliness. However, with the increased use of online social media by the public, including users of public transit, it has become possible to automatically summarize the riders' opinions on the services provided by transit agencies by statistical analysis of the words used in the social media messages. This work describes a system based on machine learning to summarize text messages regarding transportation in California on online social media platforms. This tool is intended to reveal factors important to transportation users that may not be evident to transit agencies and hence will not be collected by rider surveys. The system uses an unsupervised statistical topic modeling algorithm (latent Dirichlet allocation) to cluster public messages related to transportation on the Twitter social media platform into distinct “topics.” Sentiment analysis was then utilized to assign a polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) to each message and then the sentiment is aggregated by topic. The system is thus able to summarize the sentiment towards each automatically identified topic. The approach was applied to a set of 10,400 tweets containing words related to transportation; these messages were downloaded over a period of three weeks in 2016. The proposed system was evaluated by varying topic modeling algorithm parameters and studying the effect of parameters on the interpretability of results. It was found that the quality of topic identification depends on the size of the dataset, the number of topics that has to be specified to the topic modeling algorithm, and the positive/negative thresholds for the sentiment analysis algorithm.","","978-1-5386-4649-6","10.1109/CCWC.2018.8301704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8301704","public transportation;machine learning;classification;topic modeling;latent Dirichlet allocation;crowdsourcing;sentiment analysis","Transportation;Twitter;Sentiment analysis;Feature extraction;Analytical models;Safety","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;sentiment analysis;social networking (online);statistical analysis;traffic engineering computing;transportation","unsupervised classification;online community input;advance transportation services;transit agencies;regular rider surveys;public transit;statistical analysis;social media messages;text messages;online social media platforms;transportation users;unsupervised statistical topic modeling algorithm;cluster public messages;Twitter social media platform;topic identification;sentiment analysis algorithm","","2","","22","","26 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Gaining insights into such interaction is crucial to understand the contagion adoption behaviors, and thus can make better predictions. In this paper, we study the contagion adoption behavior under a set of interactions, specifically, the interactions among users, contagions' contents, and sentiments, which are learned from social network structures and texts. We develop an effective and efficient interaction-aware diffusion (IAD) framework, incorporating these interactions into a unified model. We also present a generative process to distinguish user roles, a co-training method to determine contagions' categories and a new topic model to obtain topic-specific sentiments. Evaluation on the large-scale Weibo dataset demonstrates that our proposal can learn how different users, contagion categories, and sentiments interact with each other efficiently. With these interactions, we can make a more accurate prediction than the state-of-art baselines. Moreover, we can better understand how the interactions influence the propagation process and thus can suggest useful directions for information promotion or suppression in viral marketing.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2018.2857492","National Key Research and Development Funding(grant numbers:2017YFB0803301); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61300014,61672313); NSF(grant numbers:IIS-1526499,IIS-1763325,CNS-1626432); Dong Guan Innovative Research Team Program(grant numbers:201636000100038); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8413173","Social networks;information diffusion;interaction-aware framework;sentiment analysis;topic model","Diffusion processes;Social network services;Predictive models;Sentiment analysis;Computer science;Data mining","learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online)","contagion adoption behavior;social network structures;texts;effective interaction-aware diffusion;efficient interaction-aware diffusion;unified model;user roles;topic model;topic-specific sentiments;contagion categories;sentiments interact;information promotion;IAD;interaction-aware diffusion framework;social networks;multiple contagions;purchasing behaviors;information diffusion models;contagion spreads","","10","","52","IEEE","19 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most works have been focusing on those widely used languages, such as English and Chinese, with huge dialogue corpora being collected and thoroughly analyzed for training the dialogue generation models. In addition, retaining the human-like diversity and spontaneity of speech in these corpora is challenging for building dialogue systems. In this paper, we propose a method to build a lage Japanese dialogue corpus by using the conversations posted on Twitter and to annotate the dialogue- and utterance-level topic labels and the corresponding probabilistic scores automatically by analyzing the similarity between the word clusters and the dialogue clusters of the corpus in the same semantic space. The advantage of this method is that it does not require the expensive time and effort of human workers for mimicking dialogues and annotating labels, which is specifically useful for those less widely used languages, such as Japanese. We compare four filtering settings with respect to the lower-bound of utterance length for corpus creation and topic annotation and report the effect of the utterance length to the quality of our dialogue corpus, based on a manual evaluation. Based on this corpus, we further propose two topic-based dialogue generation tasks, that is, the next-response-topic prediction task and the next-topic-based response generation task.

In addition to semantics-based interactivity, the framework enables dynamic cross-language switching between web pages represented in different languages representing same topics through use of their inherent semantic relations. The approach uses transforming natural web content representations to an intermediate index of latent topic distributions. As the system is semantically indexed, no translation or transliteration techniques are required for cross language switch. The multi-dimensional topic index is built using content-topic distributions which in turn are inferred using supervised topic models. The end-to-end system has been developed as an industrial application with enhanced navigational capability provided as an extension to Samsung Browser v4.0 for Android platform. The service also allows standard browsers to query limited services using the web services RESTful API.

However, it introduces a problem of semantic objects association. Correct object association is the key factor to achieve a successful object SLAM system because object association and SLAM are inherently coupled and have not been well tackled yet. A novel formulation of the object association problem based on a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) is proposed. Through the HDP, we can hierarchically associate the grouped object measurements. This can improve the object association accuracy and computation efficiency. Thanks to the novel formulation, the proposed method is also able to correct failure object associations according to its sampling inference algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce object poses to the processing of pose optimization. The object association and pose optimization are then solved in a tightly coupled way, by which both aspects can promote each other. The proposed method is evaluated on indoor and outdoor datasets and the experimental results show a very impressive improvement with respect to the traditional SLAM.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2932216","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1305200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876167,U1509207); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8794595","Visual Semantic SLAM;Object Association;Hierarchical Dirichlet Process","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Semantics;Optimization;Cameras;Image reconstruction;Atmospheric modeling;Computer science","inference mechanisms;SLAM (robots)","semantic SLAM;semantic objects association;grouped object measurements;computation efficiency;failure object associations;hierarchical topic model based object association;object-based simultaneous localization and mapping;object SLAM system;sampling inference algorithm","","25","","40","IEEE","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, Internet protocol television (IPTV) has been regarded as an important source for the Internet multimedia computing and service in our daily lives. With the development of IPTV user interest inference for network resource allocation and energy efficient design, the quality of experience (QoE) has been considered as one of the most prominent evaluation indicators for IPTV service. However, due to the explosive increase of TV programs and user's mixed interests, how to quickly infer user interest and thus effectively allocate IPTV network resources are still a challenging and urgent problem. Moreover, with the increasing amount of user data, the requirement of real-time processing is more important than before. To handle these issues, we first put forward a new indicator called watching ratio to calculate the proportion of program's time watched by user, which could measure user's subjective watching QoE from objective perspective. Then, considering both the users' current interests and their prospective interests, we propose a combinational latent Dirichlet allocation (cLDA) model and design the associated batch-based Gibbs sampling algorithm for user interest inference. Furthermore, considering the real-time processing demand in applications, we also design an online-based inference algorithm for the proposed cLDA (online-cLDA) model. Experimental results show that the proposed models and algorithms can improve the accuracy of user interest inference which can be beneficial to IPTV resource allocation in an energy efficient design.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2868163","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571240,61601004,61601005); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20161517); Qing Lan Project; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017M611881); National Engineering Research Center of Communications and Network Technology, NUPT(grant numbers:TXKY17003); Scientific Research Foundation of NUPT(grant numbers:NY217022,NY218011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8452900","Energy efficiency;smart building;Internet protocol television (IPTV);combinational Latent Dirichlet allocation (cLDA);user interests;batch-based and online-based inference","IPTV;Quality of experience;Inference algorithms;Resource management;Smart buildings;Real-time systems","IPTV;multimedia computing;resource allocation","energy efficient design;IPTV network resources;IPTV resource allocation;combinational LDA-based topic model;energy efficient IPTV service;smart building;global energy consumption;Internet protocol television;IPTV user interest inference;network resource allocation","","7","","30","OAPA","31 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While Russia denied involvement, it is clear that the U.S. has to take some defensive measures to protect its data infrastructure. Insider threats have been the cause of other sensitive information leaks too, including the infamous Edward Snowden incident. Most of the recent leaks were in the form of text. Due to the nature of text data, security classifications are assigned manually. In an adversarial environment, insiders can leak texts through E-mail, printers, or any untrusted channels. The optimal defense is to automatically detect the unstructured text security class and enforce the appropriate protection mechanism without degrading services or daily tasks. Unfortunately, existing Data Leak Prevention (DLP) systems are not well suited for detecting unstructured texts. In this paper, we compare two recent approaches in the literature for text security classification, evaluating them on actual sensitive text data from the WikiLeaks dataset.","","978-1-5090-6356-7","10.1109/THS.2017.7943471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943471","","Security;Feature extraction;Natural language processing;Electronic mail;Training;Sensitivity;Springs","data protection;electronic mail;government data processing;pattern classification;security of data;text analysis","automated US diplomatic cables security classification;topic model pruning;US Government;cyberattacks;email leakage;data infrastructure protection;insider threats;sensitive information leaks;Edward Snowden incident;adversarial environment;text leakage;printers;untrusted channels;automatic unstructured text security class detection;protection mechanism;data leak prevention system;DLP system;text security classification;sensitive text data;WikiLeaks dataset","","3","","9","","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

State-of-the-art in this area ranges from plain techniques of keyword matching, measuring the relevance of source code modules based on their inter-dependency, to customizing the PageRank algorithms for scoring the appropriateness of the targeted source code files. In this paper, we propose a novel search engine for source code modules that takes into account both domain keywords (e.g., healthcare) and API functions (e.g., digitalRead). Our search engine involves ranking a list of selected source code files relative to an ordered list of API functions entered by the programmer. We mine all possible sequential patterns of API functions out of a pre-built repository of source code. Patterns that are relevant to the input API functions would serve as a grid for scoring the appropriateness of source code files being considered.

It exploits probabilistic latent topics in order to take advantage of the semantics pervading the latent topic space when identifying spectral signatures and estimating fractional abundances from hyperspectral images. Despite the contrasted potential of topic models to uncover image semantics, they have been merely used in hyperspectral unmixing as a straightforward data decomposition process. This limits their actual capabilities to provide semantic representations of the spectral data. The proposed model, called dual-depth sparse probabilistic latent semantic analysis (DEpLSA), makes use of two different levels of topics to exploit the semantic patterns extracted from the initial spectral space in order to relieve the ill-posed nature of the unmixing problem. In other words, DEpLSA defines a first level of deep topics to capture the semantic representations of the spectra, and a second level of restricted topics to estimate endmembers and abundances over this semantic space. An experimental comparison in conducted using the two standard topic models and the seven state-of-the-art unmixing methods available in the literature.

It is a valuable and urgent task to find appropriate collaborators for scholars. To address these problems, we hypothesize that fusing topic model and structure information could improve the performance of recommendations. In this paper, we propose a collaborator recommendation system, named TNERec (Topic-aware Network Embedding for scientific collaborator Recommendation), learning representations from scholars' research interests and network structure. TNERec first extracts scholars' research interests based on topic model and then learns vectors of scholars with network embedding. Finally, top-k recommendation list is generated based on the scholar vectors.

To address action recognition problems, this paper presents a framework that jointly models multiple complex actions and motion units at different hierarchical levels. We achieve this by proposing a generative topic model, namely, multi-label hierarchical Dirichlet process (ML-HDP). The ML-HDP model formulates the co-occurrence relationship of actions and motion units, and enables highly accurate recognition. In particular, our topic model possesses the three-level representation in action understanding, where low-level local features are connected to high-level actions via mid-level atomic actions. This allows the recognition model to work discriminatively. In our ML-HDP, atomic actions are treated as latent topics and automatically discovered from data. In addition, we incorporate the notion of class labels into our model in a semi-supervised fashion to effectively learn and infer multi-labeled videos. Using discovered topics and inferred labels, which are jointly assigned to local features, we present the straightforward methods to perform three recognition tasks including action classification, joint classification and segmentation of continuous actions, and spatiotemporal action localization. In experiments, we explore the use of three different features and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach for these tasks on four public datasets: KTH, MSR-II, Hollywood2, and UCF101.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2816960","Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion(grant numbers:2016-0-00406); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8319448","Action recognition;action segmentation;action localization;topic modeling;Dirichlet process","Hidden Markov models;Visualization;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Trajectory;Data models","computer vision;feature extraction;image classification;image motion analysis;image recognition;image representation;video signal processing","spatiotemporal action localization;human actions;videos;computer vision research;visual surveillance;action recognition problems;motion units;generative topic model;multilabel hierarchical Dirichlet process;ML-HDP model formulates;highly accurate recognition;three-level representation;action understanding;low-level local features;high-level actions;mid-level atomic actions;recognition model;class labels;human-computer interaction;hierarchical levels;recognition tasks;action classification;multiple complex actions;hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric model;continuous action segmentation;KTH public dataset;MSR-II public dataset;Hollywood2 public dataset;UCF101 public dataset","","26","","61","IEEE","19 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the massive number of repositories available, there is a pressing need for topic-based search. Even though the topic label functionality has been introduced, the majority of GitHub repositories do not have any labels, impeding the utility of search and topic-based analysis. This work targets the automatic repository classification problem as keyword-driven hierarchical classification. Specifically, users only need to provide a label hierarchy with keywords to supply as supervision. This setting is flexible, adaptive to the users' needs, accounts for the different granularity of topic labels and requires minimal human effort. We identify three key challenges of this problem, namely (1) the presence of multi-modal signals; (2) supervision scarcity and bias; (3) supervision format mismatch. In recognition of these challenges, we propose the HiGitClass framework, comprising of three modules: heterogeneous information network embedding; keyword enrichment; topic modeling and pseudo document generation. Experimental results on two GitHub repository collections confirm that HiGitClass is superior to existing weakly-supervised and dataless hierarchical classification methods, especially in its ability to integrate both structured and unstructured data for repository classification.

The typical practice in the application of topic models is to tune the parameters of a chosen model for a target dataset and select the model with the best output based on a given metric. We present a novel perspective on topic analysis by presenting a process for combining output from multiple models with different theoretical underpinnings. We show that this results in our ability to tackle novel tasks such as semantic characterization of content that cannot be carried out by using single models. One example task is to characterize the differences between topics or documents in terms of their purpose and also importance with respect to the underlying output of the discovery algorithm. To show the potential benefit of leveraging multiple models we present an algorithm to map the term-space of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to the neural document-embedding space of doc2vec. We also show that by utilizing both models in parallel and analyzing the resulting document distributions using the Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) metric we can gain insight into the purpose and importance of topics across models. This approach moves beyond topic identification to a richer characterization of the information and provides a better understanding of the complex relationships between these typically competing techniques.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3210529","Laboratory for Analytic Sciences (LAS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905590","Artificial intelligence;big data applications;data analysis;data visualization;knowledge discovery;natural language processing","Artificial intelligence;Data analysis;Analytical models;Knowledge discovery;Computational modeling;Clustering algorithms;Semantics;Natural language processing","","","","","","34","CCBY","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Aggregation method in a software quality model denotes how to aggregate low-level metrics to high-level quality characteristics. Most of the existing quality models adopt the weighted linear aggregation method. The main drawback of weighted linear method is that it suffers from a lack of consensus in how to decide the correct weights. To address this issue, we present an automated aggregation method which adopts a kind of probabilistic weight instead of the subjective weight in previous aggregation methods. In particular, we leverage a topic modeling technique to estimate the probabilistic weight by learning from a software benchmark.In this manner, our approach can enable automated quality assessment by using the learned probabilistic relationship without manual effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of proposed aggregation approach, we conduct an empirical study on assessing one typical high-level quality characteristic (i.e., maintainability) which is regarded as an important characteristic defined in ISO 9126.

To solve that sparse problem of the short text data, in this paper, we present a HVCH (Hot topic detection based on the VSM Combined HMBTM) fusion model algorithm. Taking heat as the key factor, the heat matrix of calculated words and pairs is introduced to improve the BTM(Biterm Topic Model) model, and the semantic relationship between words is mined through the common heat between words, which is applied to the detection of hot topics in short text. Subsequently, we fuse the VSM(Vector Space Model) model with the HMBTM(Heat Matrix based BTM) model and uses the optimized Single-Pass clustering algorithm to obtain hot topics. At last, we conduct extensive experiments over real data sets, which demonstrate that our proposal achieves excellent performance to other related algorithms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2932458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8784196","Short text classification;heat matrix;the biterm topic model;topics detection","Heating systems;Data models;Semantics;Dictionaries;Clustering algorithms;Adaptation models;Probability distribution","pattern classification;pattern clustering;sensor fusion;social networking (online);text analysis;vectors","word co-occurrence patterns;short text data;microblog hot topics detection;vector space model;heat matrix based BTM;biterm topic model;short text classification;VSM model fusion;HMBTM model fusion;single-pass clustering algorithm","","2","","22","CCBY","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In topic modeling, visualizing phrases for individual topics is an effective way to explore and understand unstructured text corpora. However, from phrase quality and topical cohesion perspectives, the outcomes of existing approaches remain to be improved. Usually, the process of topical phrase mining is twofold: phrase mining and topic modeling. For phrase mining, existing approaches often suffer from order sensitive and inappropriate segmentation problems, which make them often extract inferior quality phrases. For topic modeling, traditional topic models do not fully consider the constraints induced by phrases, which may weaken the cohesion. Moreover, existing approaches often suffer from losing domain terminologies since they neglect the impact of domain-level topical distribution. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for high quality and cohesive topical phrase mining. A high quality phrase should satisfy frequency, phraseness, completeness, and appropriateness criteria. In our framework, we integrate quality guaranteed phrase mining method, a novel topic model incorporating the constraint of phrases, and a novel document clustering method into an iterative framework to improve both phrase quality and topical cohesion. We also describe efficient algorithmic designs to execute these methods efficiently. The empirical verification demonstrates that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods from the aspects of both interpretability and efficiency.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2018.2823758","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201606080078); ARC(grant numbers:DP160102412,DP170104747); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61532021,61572122,U1736104); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8332520","Topical phrase mining;phrase mining;chunking;topic model","Data mining;Gaussian mixture model;Support vector machines;Terminology;Natural language processing;Social network services","data mining;natural language processing;pattern clustering;statistical analysis;text analysis","efficient method;cohesive topical phrase mining;essential semantic unit;inferior quality phrases;domain-level topical distribution;high quality phrase;topic model;phrase mining method;natural language processing;iterative framework;visualizing phrases;unstructured text corpora;document clustering method","","15","","43","IEEE","6 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hierarchical topic model is a candidate solution to these problems since it can reveal many useful relationships between the topics. These relationships can help to find high quality topics and reduce topic overlaps. In this paper, a knowledge-based semisupervised hierarchical online topic detection framework is proposed. The proposed framework can detect topics in an online hierarchical way. In addition, it has been proven that introducing external knowledge can improve the performance of text mining.

Given data consisting of a frontal-view x-ray, a set of natural language findings, and one or more diagnostic impressions, we propose a deep neural network model that during training simultaneously 1) constructs a topic model which clusters key terms from the findings into meaningful groups, 2) predicts the presence of each topic for a given input image based on learned visual features, and 3) uses an image's predicted topic encoding as features to predict one or more diagnoses. Since the net learns the topic model jointly with the classifier, it gives us a powerful tool for understanding which semantic concepts the net might be exploiting when making diagnoses, and since we constrain the net to predict topics based on expert-annotated reports, the net automatically encodes some higher-level expert knowledge about how to make diagnoses.","1945-8452","978-1-5386-3641-1","10.1109/ISBI.2019.8759548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8759548","Chest X-Ray Analysis;Multimedia Analysis;Natural Language Processing;Deep Learning","X-ray imaging;Training;Visualization;Natural languages;Feature extraction;Encoding;Predictive models","diagnostic radiography;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;pattern clustering","manual examination;multilabel diagnoses;deep neural networks;natural language findings;visual report-based information;visual classifiers;radiologists;learning-based automated chest x-ray analysis system","","4","","21","","11 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we address this challenge by developing a method using an unsupervised machine learning model to detect reports of corruption-related activity on the micro-blogging platform Twitter. In total, we collected over 6 million tweets containing keywords related to corruption between January and February 2019.

In this paper, we firstly use self-parameter-optimizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technology to mine the functional topic for the software. Then we put forward an approach for calculating the relevancy between functional topics and software documents.

The goal here is to give the user a higher level view of where different types of sightings occur, to investigate whether sightings are increasing or decreasing over time, to discover the connections between different events which might happen at different geographic areas, and to quickly identify typical incidents at a given period of time without reading the whole sightings through topic modelling. Multiple visualization and data mining techniques are combined to make sense the increasingly large UFO reports which get updated hourly. The usefulness of the application is evaluated through a case study where anon-expert in ufology can find some typical interesting sightings. Our application can also be able to detect some misleading events such as missile launch or fireworks on a specific day through keywords and topic extraction. One limitation of our application is the data which is not up-todate when new sightings are posted since the application pulled and processed data locally. Our initial application targets UFO sighting reports.

In recent years, the employment of the probabilistic topic model to acquire the latent topics of hyperspectral images has been an effective method for spectral unmixing. However, such methods fail to fully exploit the potential of topic models in uncovering image semantics, and they need extra sparsity constraints, which greatly increases the complexity of the model. To solve these problems, a sparse topic relaxion and group clustering model for HU (STRGC) is proposed. In STRGC, the sparse prior constraints implied by the sparse topic model are introduced, which means that the sparse characteristics of the model are used to capture the semantic representation of the spectrum. Through the relaxation of the model, the possible spectral representations of ground features can be obtained, and this further alleviates the influence caused by endmember variability on the accuracy of the unmixing process. Then, fuzzy clustering is used to locate the position of the endmember quickly and accurately. Furthermore, unmixing models with different characteristics are united to alleviate the ill-posed nature of the model, thereby improving the fractional abundance.

Although existing unsupervised hashing methods are suitable for operational applications, they exhibit limitations when accurately modeling the complex semantic content present in RS images using binary codes (in an unsupervised manner). To address this problem, in this letter, we introduce a novel unsupervised hashing method that takes advantage of the generative nature of probabilistic topic models to encapsulate the hidden semantic patterns of the data into the final binary representation. Specifically, we introduce a new probabilistic latent semantic hashing (pLSH) model to effectively learn the hash codes using three main steps: 1) data grouping, where the input RS archive is clustered into several groups; 2) topic computation, where the pLSH model is used to uncover highly descriptive hidden patterns from each group; and 3) hash code generation, where the data probability distributions are thresholded to generate the final binary codes. Our experimental results, obtained on two benchmark archives, reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2020.2969491","Generalitat Valenciana(grant numbers:APOSTD/2017/007); Spanish Ministry of Economy(grant numbers:ESP2016-79503-C2-2-P,RTI2018-098651-B-C54,TIN2015-63646-C5-5-R); Junta de Extremadura(grant numbers:GR18060); European Union through the H2020 EOXPOSURE Project(grant numbers:734541); European Research Council through the ERC Starting Grant BigEarth(grant numbers:759764); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8985303","Hash codes;image retrieval;probabilistic topic models;remote sensing (RS);unsupervised hashing","Semantics;Feature extraction;Probabilistic logic;Computational modeling;Binary codes;Image retrieval;Remote sensing","binary codes;file organisation;geophysical image processing;image retrieval;pattern clustering;remote sensing;statistical distributions;unsupervised learning","probabilistic latent semantic hashing model;hash codes;pLSH model;code generation;data probability distributions;binary codes;unsupervised remote sensing image retrieval;large-scale remote sensing image retrieval;massive data;RS images;unsupervised hashing method;probabilistic topic models;hidden semantic patterns;binary representation","","15","","15","IEEE","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical topic models called Bayesian Sparse Topical Coding with Poisson Distribution (BSTC-P) on the basis of Sparse Topical Coding with Sparse Groups (STCSG). Different from traditional STMs, it focuses on imposing hierarchical sparse prior to leverage the prior information of relevance between sparse coefficients. Furthermore, we propose a sparsity-enhanced BSTC, Bayesian Sparse Topical Coding with Normal Distribution (BSTC-N), via mathematic approximation. We adopt superior hierarchical sparse inducing prior, with the purpose of achieving the sparsest optimal solution.

An alternative approach is to construct separate topic models for different languages, and then to align them. We investigate this approach in this paper for Chinese-Thai texts. A key problem to align topics in different languages is to estimate their similarity, which requires the translation of topic words between the two languages. Unfortunately, the translation between Chinese and Thai is not accurate enough for this task. Therefore, we use English as pivot language, through which the topics in Chinese and Thai are aligned. In addition, the representative topic words are filtered so that only those that are specific for the topic are kept.

However, word embedding lacks discriminating information of homonymy and polysemy as they typically assign a single vector for each word even if they have different meanings in different contexts. Many models were proposed to solve this issue by jointly learning topic modeling and word embedding together so that words can have different embeddings under various latent topics. However, the number of latent topics is set manually by human experiences before learning the topic modeling, which makes the final performance of the topical model largely rely on the subjective human judgment. If the number of topics is set too many, the topics learned may suffer from overfitting issues. On the other hand, if the number of topics is too small, the topics may contain little useful information. Experiments from other researchers show that the scale we used to model the latent topics is crucial to the performance of the topical word embeddings. We proposed Multi-scaled Topic Embedding (MTE) to learn the document representation with multiple latent topics for topic modeling based on this idea. With multi-scaled topics, MTE learns topical information on a large scale and captures key information from dense topic distributions. Most importantly, MTE reduces the influence of the number of topics on the model's performance. In this paper, we apply MTE in three commonly used datasets and test the performances of our model for text classification tasks on these datasets.

It is a more challenging task compared to its single-turn counterpart since it requires the model to capture the topic drift along with the multi-turn dialogue history. In this paper, we propose a multi-turn dialogue generation model which incorporates topic drift aware information into a hierarchical encoder-decoder framework to generate coherent responses. This model first utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based topic model to obtain the topic representation of each utterance. Then a topic drift model is employed to encode the sequential topics of multi-turn dialogue history to infer the topic of response.

Recent years have witnessed growing interest in utilizing spatio-temporal social media for local topic detection. However, conventional topic models consider keywords as independent items, which suffer great limitations in modeling short texts from social media. Therefore, some studies introduce embedding into topic models to preserve the semantic correlation among keywords of short texts. Nevertheless, due to the lack of rich contexts in social media, the performance of these embedding based topic models still remain unsatisfactory. In order to enrich the contexts of keywords, we propose two network based embedding methods, both of which can generate rich contexts for keywords by random walks and produce coherent keyword embeddings for topic modeling. Besides, processing continuous spatio-temporal information in social media is also very challenging. Most of the existing methods simply split time and location into equal-size units, which fall short in capturing the continuity of spatio-temporal information. To address this issue, we present a hotspot detection algorithm to identify spatial and temporal hotspots, which can address spatio-temporal continuity and alleviate data sparsity. Finally, the experiments show that the performance of our methods has been improved significantly compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","2375-0197","978-1-7281-3798-8","10.1109/ICTAI.2019.00182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8995440","Network based embedding;Local topic detection;Social media","","data mining;embedded systems;query processing;social networking (online);text analysis","local topic detection;local event discovery;activity recommendation;spatio-temporal social media;conventional topic models;coherent keyword embeddings;topic modeling;continuous spatio-temporal information","","1","","20","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conventional photo quality models are designed by characterizing the pictures from all communities (e.g., “architecture” and “colorful”) indiscriminately, wherein community-specific features are not exploited explicitly. In this article, we develop a new community-aware photo quality evaluation framework. It uncovers the latent community-specific topics by a regularized latent topic model (LTM) and captures human visual quality perception by exploring multiple attributes. More specifically, given massive-scale online photographs from multiple communities, a novel ranking algorithm is proposed to measure the visual/semantic attractiveness of regions inside each photograph. Meanwhile, three attributes, namely: 1) photo quality scores; weak semantic tags; and inter-region correlations, are seamlessly and collaboratively incorporated during ranking. Subsequently, we construct the gaze shifting path (GSP) for each photograph by sequentially linking the top-ranking regions from each photograph, and an aggregation-based CNN calculates the deep representation for each GSP. Based on this, an LTM is proposed to model the GSP distribution from multiple communities in the latent space. To mitigate the overfitting problem caused by communities with very few photographs, a regularizer is incorporated into our LTM. Finally, given a test photograph, we obtain its deep GSP representation and its quality score is determined by the posterior probability of the regularized LTM. Comparative studies on four image sets have shown the competitiveness of our method. Besides, the eye-tracking experiments have demonstrated that our ranking-based GSPs are highly consistent with real human gaze movements.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2019.2937319","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1403600); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9153888","Community;deep feature;gaze behavior;machine learning;quality model;topic model","Visualization;Semantics;Image quality;Visual perception;Training;Computational modeling;Adaptation models","computer vision;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);image motion analysis;image representation;probability;visual perception","weak semantic tags;inter-region correlations;top-ranking regions;test photograph;deep GSP representation;quality score;regularized LTM;ranking-based GSPs;human gaze movements;computational photo quality evaluation;computer vision;community-specific features;latent community-specific topics;community-aware photo quality evaluation;massive-scale online photographs;human visual quality perception;human perception encoding;latent topic model;semantic attractiveness;visual attractiveness;photo quality scores;gaze shifting path;aggregation-based CNN;GSP distribution;posterior probability","Algorithms;Humans;Semantics;Visual Perception","","","71","IEEE","31 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this issue, this work explores a way to enable the semantic matching for the contents (including words, phrases, or sentences) in query and the sentences in service description, by mapping words and sentences into the same semantic space. Specifically, we propose an unsupervised Bayesian probabilistic model, bi-Directional Hybrid Priors Topic Model (bi-HPTM), to capture the textual semantics of the words and sentences in a probabilistic simplex, which provides a flexible operation to build the semantic links from the queries to service descriptions. Meanwhile, the textual semantics generated by bi-HPTM is highly interpretable that help to understand the user requirements. The proposed model is examined by ProgrammableWeb. Experimental results demonstrate that bi-HPTM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for semantic service discovery on service classification and retrieval.

Predicting online user behavior is an important challenge for various applications. Personalization, recommendation systems, target advertisements are based on user behavior prediction, where user's next purchases or actions need to be predicted. In this paper, we propose a hybrid generative model that can predict user behavior considering multiple factors. While previous work has been focused on two aspects individually: predicting repeat behavior or predicting new behavior, our model considers both aspects simultaneously during the learning process. The user-specific preference component is used to capture repeat behavior patterns, while the latent group preference component is used to discover new behavior. Besides these two components, we also consider the exogenous effect, which is not captured in the former two.

Answers and WikiAnswers, have become popular with users as one of the central paradigms for satisfying users’ information needs. The task of question retrieval aims to answer one's query directly by finding the most relevant questions (together with their answers) from an archive of past questions. However, questions are always short text that there is a lexical gap between the queried question and the past questions. Furthermore, the underlying intents of two questions could be very different even if they bear a close lexical resemblance. To alleviate these problems, we present a hybrid approach that blends several language modelling techniques for question retrieval, namely, the Classic (query-likelihood) Language Model, the state-of-the-art Translation-based Language Model, and our proposed Semantic-based Language Model and Intent-based Language Model. The semantics of each candidate question is derived by a Probabilistic Topic Model, which makes use of local and global semantic graphs for capturing the hidden interactions among entities (e.g. people, places and concepts) in question–answer pairs.

Taking both low and high resolution into account, we present a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) saliency model to detect airport target. Different from conventional saliency models focusing on nature images, our HRL model is more effective for multiresolution remote sensing images. According to airport characteristic, we design a reinforcement learning structure to suppress background and highlight interesting airport regions level by level. To generate a final saliency map, we fuse bottom–up region features with top–down line feature based on target attribute, which can restrain other salient regions except for airports. Moreover, a learning stop criterion based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model is proposed at each level to judge the state of saliency detection, thus learning process can be adaptively controlled. Besides, a back-level propagation mechanism is employed to reinforce airport target between levels. HRL saliency model can take the advantage of hierarchical structure to quickly locate interest regions in remote sensing images with large cover area. Furthermore, HRL is robust for illumination and resolution variety. Extensive experimental results on a remote sensing dataset containing 730 images of 40 different airports demonstrate that the proposed HRL model outperforms 18 state-of-the-art saliency models in terms of two popular evaluation measures.

However, the LDA model as well as the training process of LDA may expose the text information in the training data, thus bringing significant privacy concerns. To address the privacy issue in LDA, we systematically investigate the privacy protection of the main-stream LDA training algorithm based on Collapsed Gibbs Sampling (CGS) and propose several differentially private LDA algorithms for typical training scenarios. In particular, we present the first theoretical analysis on the inherent differential privacy guarantee of CGS based LDA training and further propose a centralized privacy-preserving algorithm (HDP-LDA) that can prevent data inference from the intermediate statistics in the CGS training.

This work focuses on the problem of discovering a user's interest over time on twitter. Previous approaches have used to model the user topic of interest on twitter by building the profile of the users, that contain the words which can be used the user in his or her conversions with other users, but on twitter users used the noisy words which does not represent the correct topics or topic related to interest. This model has extended by a novel framework by using twitter user model. This model uses the latent topic variable to indicate the relatedness of the topic with any user. In this work, we propose a Temporal User Topic (TUT) approach which can consider the text of tweet by any user and time of the tweet. The proposed approach is used to discover topically related Users for different time periods. We also show how the interests and relationships of these users are changeovers a time period.","","978-1-5090-6414-4","10.1109/ITNEC.2017.8284832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8284832","Topic Model;User Interest;Twitter;Twitter-User Model;Social Network;Time Topic Modeling","Twitter;Semantics;Signal processing;Recommender systems;Mathematical model;Computer science","data mining;semantic Web;social networking (online);text analysis","temporal user interest;semantic based dynamic interest finding model;TUT;dynamic web;twitter user model;latent topic;Temporal User Topic approach;tweet text;social media systems","","5","","20","","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How to detect new topics quickly and accurately at such data scale plays a vital role in information recommendation and public opinion control. One of the basic research tasks of topic detection is how to represent a topic. The existing topic representation models do not focus on how to select better differentiated words to represent topics, are still computer-centered, and do not effectively combine human intelligence and artificial intelligence (AI). To solve these problems, this article proposes a word-distributed sensitive topic representation model (WDS-LDA) based on hybrid human-AI (H-AI). The basic idea is that the distribution of words within a topic or among different topics has a great influence on the selection of topic expression words. If a word is evenly distributed among all documents of a certain topic, it indicates that the word is the common word of all documents in the topic, and it is more suitable to represent this topic. If a word is more evenly distributed among various topics, it indicates that the word is a common word of all topics, and cannot be used for the purpose of distinguishing among topics, becoming less suitable to represent any topic. At the same time, the human cognitive ability and cognitive models are introduced into topic representation based on H-AI. We introduce the user's modification of topic expression words into the topic model representation so that the topic model can learn human wisdom and become more and more accurate. Therefore, three different weights are introduced: inside weight; outside weight; and manual adjustment weight. The inside weight describes the uniform distribution of a word in the given topic, the outside weight describes the uniform distribution of a word in all topics, and the manual adjustment weight reflects whether a word is suitable as a representative vocabulary in the past manual adjustment. Tests using Sina microblog's actual data sets show that the WDS-LDA algorithm makes the representative words more important, the distinction among different topic words higher, and effectively improves the precision of subsequent algorithms, such as topic detection and topic evolutionary analysis using the topic model.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2019.2959826","NSFC(grant numbers:61972106,U1636215,61871140,61572153,61872420); National Key research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2019QY1406,2018YFB0803504); Guangdong Province Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2019B010136003,2019B010137004); project “PCL Future Regional Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications”(grant numbers:PCL2018KP001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946759","Hybrid human–artificial intelligence (H-AI);latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model;social network;topic detection;topic representation model","Computational modeling;Social networking (online);Analytical models;Data models;Manuals;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);vocabulary","topic evolutionary analysis;online social networks;hybrid human-artificial intelligence;topic detection;word-distributed sensitive topic representation model;topic expression words;topic model representation;representative words;vital role;WDS-LDA;hybrid human-AI;Sina microblog;human wisdom learning","","7","","33","IEEE","31 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Beyond, they often exploit short text streams in a batch way and are difficult to find evolving topics in term-changing subspaces. In this article, we propose an online semantic-enhanced graphical model for evolving short text stream clustering (OSGM), by exploiting the word-occurrence semantic information and dynamically maintaining evolving active topics in term-changing subspaces in an online way. Compared to the existing approaches, our online model is not only free of determining the optimal batch size but also lends itself to handling large-scale data streams efficiently. It is also able to handle the ``term ambiguity'' problem without incorporating features from external resources. More importantly, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to extract evolving topics in term-changing subspaces automatically in an online way.

In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised approach, namely Fragment Recommender for APIs with PageRank and Topic model (FRAPT). FRAPT can well address two main challenges lying in the task and effectively determine relevant tutorial fragments for APIs. In FRAPT, a Fragment Parser is proposed to identify APIs in tutorial fragments and replace ambiguous pronouns and variables with related ontologies and API names, so as to address the pronoun and variable resolution challenge. Then, a Fragment Filter employs a set of non-explanatory detection rules to remove non-explanatory fragments, thus address the non-explanatory fragment identification challenge. Finally, two correlation scores are achieved and aggregated to determine relevant fragments for APIs, by applying both topic model and PageRank algorithm to the retained fragments. Extensive experiments over two publicly open tutorial corpora show that, FRAPT improves the state-of-the-art approach by 8.77% and 12.32% respectively in terms of F-Measure. The effectiveness of key components of FRAPT is also validated.","1558-1225","978-1-5386-3868-2","10.1109/ICSE.2017.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7985648","Application Programming Interface;PageRank Algorithm;Topic Model;Unsupervised Approaches","Tutorials;Correlation;Ontologies;Programming;Manuals;Software;Filtering algorithms","application program interfaces;computer aided instruction;computer science education;grammars;recommender systems;unsupervised learning","API tutorials;unsupervised approach;Fragment Recommender for APIs with PageRank and Topic model;FRAPT;fragment parser;fragment filter;nonexplanatory fragment identification;variable resolution challenge;pronoun challenge;F-Measure;application programming interfaces","","40","","41","","20 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering that the symptoms as the labels in Parkinson data set always have correlations with each other, we can facilitate the multi-label learning process by exploiting label correlations. Current multi-label classification methods mainly try to exploit the correlations from label pairwise or label chain. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient framework for multi-label classification called Latent Dirichlet Allocation Multi-Label (LDAML), which aims at leaning the global correlations by using the topic model on the class labels. Briefly, we try to obtain the abstract “topics” on the label set by topic model, which can exploit the global correlations among the labels. Extensive experiments clearly validate that the proposed approach is a general and effective framework which can improve most of the multi-label algorithms' performance.

However, the ability to characterize gene expression and function of individual cells brings with it new data-related challenges, such as dimensionality, feature reduction, and noise reduction. The central objective of this research was to use existing methods in a novel application of single-cell gene expression data to better characterize sub-populations of cell types in various regions of the brain. This research approach used a computational bioinformatics pipeline for single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) normalization and clustering. Data science methodologies, such as autoencoding and text mining, were adapted to identify candidate gene sets that distinguish different types of cells in the central nervous system. Then, the functional themes of these gene sets were inferred using a combination of functional enrichment of gene ontology terms and topic modeling. Topic modeling revealed various functional themes among the clusters, in some cases reinforcing the results of biomarker analysis, and in other cases providing further insight into potential functional differences between clusters. For one cluster in the cortex, an immune theme emerged with stemmed-words as specific as “immun” and “antigen” appearing in the results. In the hippocampus, clusters determined to be neurons could be further differentiated as themes related to various organs were identified. One of these clusters featured a vascular theme with words related to “endotheli.” Future applications of these methods intend to expound upon specific cellular processes, in relation to immune function, and translational research on neurological disease states.","","978-1-5386-6343-1","10.1109/SIEDS.2018.8374718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8374718","Genomics;Computational Biology;Neuroimmunology;Topic Modeling;Autoencoder","Hippocampus;Gene expression;Bioinformatics;Immune system;Genomics;Text mining;Noise reduction","bioinformatics;cellular biophysics;data mining;diseases;genetics;molecular biophysics;neurophysiology;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;RNA;text analysis","cortex;hippocampus;immune function;autoencoders;text mining;single cell populations;genomic technology;cell types;gene regulation;feature reduction;noise reduction;single-cell gene expression data;computational bioinformatics pipeline;RNA-seq;clustering;data science methodologies;autoencoding;central nervous system;gene sets;topic modeling;single-cell RNA-sequencing","","","","30","","7 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, many violations and road crashes involving online ride-hailing were related to the unhealthy working pace of drivers, especially inadequate rest. This paper enriches the literature by providing a first look into the latent break patterns of online ride-hailing drivers based on a one-month order record dataset. A data mining and knowledge discovery process is presented for extracting and analyzing characteristics of online ride-hailing drivers’ work and rest based on GPS trajectory data, as follows: 1) logical judging to identify non-work order-gaps; 2) dynamic topic modeling to discover latent break patterns; and 3) integrating the topic modeling results with feature analysis results of order-gaps to summarize the time-dependent characteristics of online ride-hailing drivers’ special working pace. The case study results show that the latent break patterns extracted from two cities’ online ride-hailing order records are significantly different in the strength and cycles of the topics, which is greatly related to the travel supply-demand conditions and urban characters. Furthermore, the proposed analytical framework can help mobile transportation platform companies to better understand online ride-hailing markets from the perspective of drivers and to adjust their marketing strategies in real time.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3094796","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1600900); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9489380","Dynamic topic model;latent break pattern;non-work order-gap;online ride-hailing;order-gap","Vehicles;Public transportation;Data mining;Data models;Vehicle dynamics;Global Positioning System;Fatigue","data mining;Internet;traffic engineering computing;transportation","online ride-hailing drivers;latent break patterns;cities;ride-hailing markets;implicit working pace;order record dataset;data mining;knowledge discovery process;GPS trajectory data;logical judging;nonwork order-gap;dynamic topic modeling;feature analysis;time-dependent characteristics;supply-demand conditions;mobile transportation platform","","","","44","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a different proposal distribution for the MH step based on the observation that distributions on the upper hierarchy level change slower than the document specific distributions at the lower level. This reduces the sampling complexity, making it linear in the number of topics per document, at unchanged test set log-likelihood.

One promising idea is to minimize the feature distribution differences of the two domains. Most existing studies explicitly minimize such differences by an exact alignment mechanism (aligning features by one-to-one feature alignment, projection matrix etc.). Such exact alignment, however, will restrict models' learning ability and will further impair models' performance on classification tasks when the semantic distributions of different domains are very different. To address this problem, we propose a novel group alignment which aligns the semantics at group level. In addition, to help the model learn better semantic groups and semantics within these groups, we also propose a partial supervision for model's learning in source domain. To this end, we embed the group alignment and a partial supervision into a cross-domain topic model, and propose a Cross-Domain Labeled LDA (CDL-LDA).

The employment of the probabilistic topic model to acquire latent topics of hyperspectral image has been an effective way for spectral unmixing. However, this approach fails to consider the sparsity of the semantic representation and high computational complexity. In addition, the number of endmembers cannot be determined automatically. To solve the problem, in this paper, the novel spectral unmixing method based on semi-automatic fully sparse semantic modeling framework (SFSSM) is proposed. In SFSSM, modestly few arithmetic operations are required to identify the pure spectral signatures (endmembers) and the fractional abundances of the endmembers. Meanwhile, the sparsity and representativeness of the topics generated by SFSSM guarantee that the endmembers can be obtained automatically in low time consumption.

However, the heterophily (i.e., tendency to link to different others) of nodes is neglected, which is pervasive in social networks. In this paper, we simultaneously incorporate community detection and topic modeling in a unified framework, and appeal to Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to capture the latent semantic correlations between the two heterogeneous factors, community and topic. Despite of the homophily (i.e., tendency to link to similar others) or heterophily, CCA can properly capture the inherent correlations which fit the dataset itself without any prior hypothesis. We also impose auxiliary word embeddings to improve the quality of topics.

LDA model assumes the documents as a mixture of topics that group the co-occurrence words with the certain probabilities. Hence the model is popularly used to extract the latent topics from document collections. However, LDA gives an independence assumption between topics and is unable to model the correlation between the topics. Motivated by above limitation, this study introduces a method for improving the topic correlation. The correlation of two topics from different time periods can occur when there exists a publication tagged by the two topics and these two topics are said to be co-occurred by this publication. LDA weights of these co-occurred topics are used in our model to calculate gross-correlation values. The number of publications in a topic co-occurrence is also used in the model. Therefore, we split dataset into groups with some common sub-dataset ordered by temporal timestamp of published year. The experiment results show the correlation between topics in different time periods and results can further support the research collaboration in future.","","978-1-5386-5538-2","10.1109/JCSSE.2018.8457380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8457380","topic correlation;topic model;topic evolution","Correlation;Probability distribution;Computational modeling;Data collection;Data models;Computer science;Software engineering","feature extraction;statistical analysis;text analysis;word processing","latent topic extraction;document collections;LDA model;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;temporal research topics correlation;temporal topic correlation;topic co-occurrence","","1","","17","","11 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we study the generation of multi-turn dialogues based on a large corpus and take advantage of the context information and topic information of the conversation in the process of dialogue generation to generate more coherent context-sensitive responses. We improve upon existing models and attention mechanisms and propose a new hierarchical model to better solve the problem of dialogue context (the HAT model). This method enables the model to obtain more contextual information when processing and improves the ability of the model in terms of contextual relevance to produce high-quality responses. In addition, to address the absence of topics in the responses, we pre-train the LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model to extract topic words of the dialogue content and retain as much topic information of dialogue as possible.

In this work, we focus on recommendation generation. One shortcoming of existing command recommenders is that algorithms focus primarily on mirroring the short-term past,-i.e., assuming that a developer who is currently debugging will continue to debug endlessly. We propose an approach to improve on the state of the art by modeling future task context to make better recommendations to developers. That is, the approach can predict that a developer who is currently debugging may continue to debug OR may edit their program. To predict future development commands, we applied Temporal Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a topic model used primarily for natural language, to software development interaction data (i.e., command streams). We evaluated this approach on two large interaction datasets for two different IDEs, Microsoft Visual Studio and ABB Robot Studio.

However, true case estimations have been elusive due to lack of testing and diagnostic capacity, asymptomatic cases, and individuals who do not get tested or seek care. Concomitantly, new digital surveillance tools to detect, characterize, and report COVID-19 cases are emerging, including using structured and unstructured data from users self-reporting COVID-19-related experiences on the Internet and social media platforms. In this study, we develop and evaluate a hybrid unsupervised and supervised machine learning approach to detect self-reported COVID-19-related symptoms on Twitter during the early stages of the pandemic. Tweets were collected from the public API stream from March 3rd-31st 2020, filtered for COVID-19-related terms. We used the biterm topic model to cluster tweets into theme-associated groups for the first 18 days of tweets, which were then extracted and manually annotated to identify users self-reporting suspected COVID-19 symptoms or status. Using this manually annotated data as a training set, we used an XLNet deep learning model for classifying symptom-related tweets from a larger corpus and also evaluated model performance. From 4,492,954 tweets collected, the unsupervised learning process yielded 3,465 (<; 1%) symptom tweets used to form our ground-truth COVID-19 symptoms dataset (n = 11,550). The XLNet text classifier achieved the highest accuracy (.91) and f1 (.62) compared to baseline models evaluated for classification. After re-training with adjusted loss function, we boosted the classifier's precision to 0.81 while maintaining a high f1 (0.66), resulting in identification of an additional 2,622 symptom-related tweets when applied to an additional 11 days of tweets collected. Our study used a hybrid machine learning approach to enable high precision identification of Twitter user-generated COVID-19 symptom discussions.

We introduce a triple attention mechanism (TAM) to not only measure the importance of each topic concept and source element to the output elements but also the importance of the topic concept to the source element. TAM presents contextual information from three aspects and then combines them using a softmax activation to acquire the final probability distribution to enable the model to produce coherent and meaningful summaries with a wide range of rich vocabulary. The experimental evaluations which are conducted over the Gigaword and CNN/Daily Mail (CNN/DM) datasets reveal that DOSCTTA surpasses the various widely recognized state-of-the-art models (WSOTA) such as Seq2Seq, PGEN, CSM and TopicCSM. DOSCTTA achieves competitive results by generating coherent and informative summaries.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-3900-8","10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9533982","Document summarization;Concept;Topic Attention;Deep learning","Vocabulary;Systematics;Convolution;Semantics;Neural networks;Knowledge based systems;Probability distribution","convolutional neural nets;information retrieval;natural language processing;probability;text analysis","TopicCSM;PGEN;Seq2Seq;TAM;CTM;concept-based topic triple attention;source element;topic concept;triple attention mechanism;knowledge base;conceptual information;semantic topic information;concept-based topic model;concept-based topic information;document summarization framework;human common-sense knowledge;irrelevant topic content;neural network-based document summarization;convolutional sequence document summarization model","","","","21","IEEE","20 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such contextual information is often unavailable in practice, where only the users' interaction data on items can be utilized by recommender systems. The lack of interaction records, especially for new users and items, inflames the performance of recommendation further. To address these issues, both collaborative filtering, one of the most popular recommendation techniques relying on the interaction data only, and bandit mechanisms, capable of achieving the balance between exploitation and exploration, are adopted into an online interactive recommendation setting assuming independent items (i.e., arms). This assumption rarely holds in reality, since the real-world items tend to be correlated with each other. In this paper, we study online interactive collaborative filtering problems by considering the dependencies among items. We explicitly formulate item dependencies as the clusters of arms in the bandit setting, where the arms within a single cluster share the similar latent topics. In light of topic modeling techniques, we come up with a novel generative model to generate the items from their underlying topics. Furthermore, an efficient particle-learning based online algorithm is developed for inferring both latent parameters and states of our model by taking advantage of the fully adaptive inference strategy of particle learning techniques. Additionally, our inferred model can be naturally integrated with existing multi-armed selection strategies in an interactive collaborative filtering setting. Empirical studies on two real-world applications, online recommendations on movies and news, demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2018.2866041","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1461926); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8440090","Recommender systems;interactive collaborative filtering;topic modeling;cold-start problem;particle learning","Collaborative filtering;Recommender systems;Learning (artificial intelligence)","collaborative filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems","multiarmed selection strategies;multiarmed bandit;particle-learning based online algorithm;fully adaptive inference strategy;movies;news;single cluster;latent parameters;topic modeling techniques;item dependencies;online interactive collaborative filtering problems;independent items;interaction data;contextual information;item content information;users appropriate items;online interactive recommender systems;dependent arms","","17","","48","IEEE","19 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, we first divided the urban space into nine functions that satisfy the residents' activities, then used the small-scale grid to divide the city blocks and used information entropy to evaluate the mixed degree of land use functions. We then introduced the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model to identify 15 mixed patterns of land use functions and each spatial unit's topic distribution. Moreover, the JS divergence index was employed to measure spatial units' similarity, fit the distance-activity intensity decay curve, and studied the influence of the individual spatial function distribution choice. We demonstrate that in urban space, residents' daily activities mold the blending of urban area functions and shift single-function urban planning to mixed-use, consisting of single-function dominant and multi-function mixed. Besides, the functional complementarity between the activity units weakens the distance attenuation effect of the activity-space interaction intensity to some extent.

Many factors have been driving this evolution: for instance, improving language expressiveness, fixing bugs, and introducing new language features. However, modifying programming languages is a challenging process. One of the main difficulties is to gauge the perception of developers regarding the language over time. Thus, we set out to develop a framework aimed at evaluating the evolution of programming languages based on their technical documentation and the community's feedback from online discussions. Essentially, our framework is comprised of three main components: (1) Topic Modeling, which aims to extract the main semantic topics from the language aspects; (2) Sentiment Analysis, whose objective is to evaluate the perception of developers with respect to each identified topic; and (3) Data Visualization, which presents a visual metaphor that summarizes the information obtained in previous steps. To evaluate our proof-of-concept implementation of the framework, we carried out an evolutionary analysis of the Python programming language. According to our results, our framework was able to identify several changes made to the language as well as the programmers' perceptions regarding those changes: for instance, we found that the use of iterators over traditional repetition structures (i.e., count-based repetition) was initially received negatively by the community, but the outlook of developers on this new feature has matured enough for it to be considered beneficial to the programming language.","","978-1-7281-1337-1","10.1109/IRI.2019.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8843467","Data Mining;Topic Modeling;Sentiment Analysis;Programming Language Evolution","Computer languages;Data visualization;Sentiment analysis;Analytical models;Data mining;Data models;Documentation","data mining;data visualisation;evolutionary computation;Python;sentiment analysis","evolutionary analysis;programming industry;Python programming language;data mining techniques;semantic topics;topic modeling;data visualization;sentiment analysis;visual metaphor;proof-of-concept implementation","","","","26","","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this ranking, we break down the profile of the candidate into three metrics: Influence, Engagement and Relevance. These three metrics provide quantitative scores of the influence the candidate has over her network, how engaged her follower base is and how relevant the topics the candidate talks about is to the NGO's work respectively. The first metric uses the TwitterRank algorithm to measure the influence the user has on his follower base. Engagement quantifies the way the follower base reacts to the posts through likes and retweets. Finally, we implement topic modelling with LDA to quantify the relevance of the candidate's tweets to the NGO's areas of interest.

We propose two novel approaches that consider both temporal distance and lexical similarity of text blocks, collectively referred to as data proximity, in learning latent topic representation, where a graph regularizer is involved to derive the latent topic representation while preserving data proximity. In the first approach, we extend the idea of Laplacian probabilistic latent semantic analysis (LapPLSA) by introducing a distance penalty function in the affinity matrix of a graph for latent topic estimation. The estimated latent topic distributions are used to replace the traditional term-frequency vectors as the data representation of the text blocks and to measure the cohesive strength between them. In the second approach, we perform Laplacian eigenmaps, which makes use of the graph regularizer for dimensionality reduction, on latent topic distributions estimated by conventional topic modeling.

This is mainly due to the communication benefits associated with roadmapping to support effective decision-making, along with its flexible and adaptable nature to suit the particular needs of individual organizations in diverse contexts. While this demands careful design of the roadmap structure that is appropriate for different purposes and needs of roadmapping, there is a lack of specific guidance supporting the experts for effective customization of roadmap framework. Recently, however, an increased degree of customization is required in designing roadmap structures and frameworks, due to extended scopes and needs of roadmapping in a wide variety of application contexts, where different meanings of the word ‘roadmap’ are used. In this regard, this paper examines how various meanings and uses of roadmapping are applied across diverse thematic contexts with different focus of issues, by analyzing scientific publications on ‘roadmap’ using a proposed human-in-the-loop topic modelling approach. It is expected that such analyses will provide roadmapping practitioners greater insights to design appropriate roadmap structures that can support effective dialogue and communication across diverse contexts where roadmapping is increasingly being used.","2159-5100","978-1-890843-41-0","10.23919/PICMET53225.2022.9882893","Yonsei University; National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9882893","","Technological innovation;Analytical models;Decision making;Organizations;Human in the loop;Planning;Consumer electronics","","","","","","79","","14 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In reality, some phrases that best summarize documents are often absent from the original text, which motivates researchers to develop generation methods, being able to create phrases. Existing generation approaches usually adopt the encoder-decoder framework for sequence generation. However, the widely-used recurrent neural network might fail to capture long-range dependencies among items. In addition, intuitively, as keyphrases are likely to correlate with topical words, some methods propose to introduce topic models into keyphrase generation. But they hardly leverage the global information of topics. In view of this, we employ the Transformer architecture with the pre-trained BERT model as the encoder-decoder framework for keyphrase generation. BERT and Transformer are demonstrated to be effective for many text mining tasks. But they have not been extensively studied for keyphrase generation. Furthermore, we propose a topic attention mechanism to utilize the corpus-level topic information globally for keyphrase generation. Specifically, we propose BertTKG, a keyphrase generation method that uses a contextualized neural topic model for corpus-level topic representation learning, and then enhances the document representations learned by pre-trained language model for better keyphrase decoding.

Thus, a knowledge map consisting of a summary of individual services and their relations has become increasingly useful. There are two challenges in building such a knowledge graph for Web service ecosystems. First, services keep evolving in terms of function and usage pattern, while their descriptions typically remain static and obsolete. Second, service profiles usually comprise some common background terms which do not differentiate services. To address the two challenges, we developed a novel tailored topic model, named Service Representation-LDA (SR-LDA), to mine effective representations beyond service profiles to build a knowledge map. The key idea is to incorporate mashup descriptions as an indication of service evolution, and introduce a global filter to identify and filter out background terms. Extensive experiments show that the tailored model is more effective than baselines. The methodology of building knowledge maps for the real-world ProgrammableWeb service ecosystem based on the learned representations is also presented, together with the analyses of representative functionality patterns.","2474-2473","978-1-5386-2005-2","10.1109/SCC.2017.23","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8034976","service ecosystem;topic model;knowledge map","Mashups;Ecosystems;Adaptation models;Google;Mathematical model","data mining;recommender systems;Web services","individual services;knowledge graph;Web service ecosystems;service profiles;common background terms;differentiate services;novel tailored topic model;named Service Representation-LDA;SR-LDA;service evolution;learned representations;mining effective representations;generating Service ecosystem knowledge;real-world programmable Web service ecosystem","","8","","21","","14 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Service recommendation is essential to facilitate mashup developers locating desired component services among a large collection of candidates. However, the majority of existing methods utilize service profiles for content matching, not mashup descriptions. This makes them suffer from vocabulary gap and cold-start problem when recommending components for new mashups. In this paper, we propose a two-step approach to generate high-quality service representation from mashup descriptions. The first step employs a linear discriminant function to assign each term with a component service such that a coarse-grained service representation can be derived. In the second step, a novel probabilistic topic model is proposed to extract relevant terms from coarse-grained service representation. Finally, a score function is designed based on the final high-quality representation to determine recommendations. Experiments on a data set from ProgrammableWeb.com show that the proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","1007-0214","","10.23919/TST.2017.7914201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7914201","service recommendation; topic model; mashup descriptions; linear discriminant function","Mashups;Switches;Vocabulary;Feature extraction;Probabilistic logic;Mathematical model","recommender systems;Web services","mashup descriptions;vocabulary gap;cold-start problem;high-quality service representation;component service;coarse-grained service representation;relevant terms;high-quality representation;service recommendation;service composition technique;service profiles;Web services;linear discriminant function;probabilistic topic model","","1","","","","4 May 2017","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The reason is, except using ticket sales data, only limited trips can be extracted due to the lower frequency of inter-city trips during daily life. However, for ticket sales data, only limited features can be explored due to the lower spatial resolution of trajectories. Therefore, this paper endeavoured to exploit the potential of ticket sales data from the perspective of the group. Theoretically, by introducing concepts of text mining, the trip purpose of a group can be viewed as analogous to the topics of a document. Trip purpose was characterized by a time topic model (TTM) that incorporates start time, in contrast to latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). This approach was implemented via a three-step method. First, groups were reconstructed from tickets. Second, three types of features, i.e., demographic, experience and co-travel network features, were extracted as a series of words to describe passengers. Third, trip purposes were automatically clustered based on the co-occurrence of words in the same group using a TTM. This paper presents comparison experiments to evaluate feature sets and the model performance based on a web-based travel survey, including the ground truth. Moreover, this paper highlights the practical use of a TTM to detect anomalies beyond anticipated trip purpose based on large-scale ticket sales data collected from Beijing, China. The full feature set was found to be preferable since both precision and recall increased when demographic and co-travel network features were considered. Meanwhile, the TTM produced robust and balanced predictions and exhibited additional power to recognize personal business compared with baseline methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3048847","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71621001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9312139","Inter-city trip;ticket sales data;topic model;trip purpose inference","Hidden Markov models;Feature extraction;Data models;Spatial resolution;Radio frequency;Unsupervised learning;Support vector machines","data mining;feature extraction;inference mechanisms;Internet;pattern clustering;sales management;text analysis;traffic engineering computing;transportation;travel industry","feature set;co-travel network features;TTM;inferring inter-city trip purpose;trip purpose inference;passively collected data;inter-city trips;time topic model;tickets;web-based travel survey;anticipated trip purpose;large-scale ticket sales data","","","","32","CCBY","1 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In which, an author-paper bilayer citation network is built, then an enhanced topic model, Author Community Topic Time Model (ACTTM) is proposed to detect high quality author communities in the author layer, and a set of attributes are proposed to comprehensively depict the author/paper nodes in the bilayer citation network. Experimental results prove that the proposed ACTTM can detect high quality author communities and facilitate low time complexity, and the proposed academic recommendation method can effectively improve the recommendation accuracy.","1673-5447","","10.1109/CC.2018.8424608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424608","academic recommendation;topic model;community detection;bilayer citation network","Network topology;Computational modeling;Gold;Topology;Internet;Classification algorithms;Buildings","citation analysis;recommender systems","citation network-based academic recommendation;author-paper bilayer citation network;Author Community Topic Time Model;ACTTM community;time complexity;author recommendation","","2","","","","2 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a methodology, based on Twitter data, to capture the satisfaction of a large mass of users of public transport, allowing us to improve the characterization and location of their satisfaction level. We analyzed a massive volume of tweets referring to the public transport system in Santiago, Chile (Transantiago) using text mining techniques, such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling, in order to capture and group bus users' expressions. Results show that, although the level of detail and variety of answers obtained from surveys are higher than the ones obtained by our method, the amount of bus stops and bus services covered by the proposed scheme is larger. Moreover, the proposed methodology can be effectively used to diagnose problems in a timely manner, as it is able to identify and locate trends, and issues related to bus operating firms, whereas surveys tend to produce average answers. Based on the consistency and logic of the results, we argue that the proposed methodology can be used as a valuable complement to surveys, as both present different, but compatible characteristics.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2915107","Volvo Research and Educational Foundations; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8708245","Natural language processing;public transport;sentiment analysis;topic modeling;user satisfaction","Databases;Twitter;Sentiment analysis;Tools;Real-time systems;Analytical models;Software","data mining;human factors;public transport;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","Santiago;Chile;public transport system;regular measurements;sound measurements;typical evaluation schemes;time-consuming surveys;Twitter data;satisfaction level;sentiment analysis;topic modeling;bus stops;bus services;timely manner;bus operating firms;user satisfaction;text mining techniques;group bus users expression","","10","","23","OAPA","7 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, unstructured accident text data are most of the time found to be unutilized or under-utilized. In order to handle the issues, the present work employs topic modeling technique to handle the large amount of accident narratives. Self-organizing map (SOM), used for better visualization of the data, is used with other clustering algorithms like k-means, hierarchical clustering for extraction of accident patterns. SOM-based k-means outperforms other algorithms with 84.52% accuracy. In addition, six optimal number of clusters are found out from the analysis. Slip-trip-fall, and material handling are found to be the significant determinants towards the accident causation.

In this paper, we propose a novel measure of such polarization, which, by way of simple topic modelling, quantifies differences in collective articulation of public agendas among relevant political actors. Unlike most other polarization measures, our measure allows cross-national comparison. Analyzing a large amount of speech records of legislative debate in the United States Congress and the Japanese Diet over a long period of time, we have reached two intriguing findings. First, on average, Japanese political actors are far more polarized in their issue articulation than their counterparts in the U.S., which is somewhat surprising given the recent notion of U.S. politics as highly polarized. Second, the polarization in each country shows its own temporal dynamics in response to a different set of factors. In Japan, structural factors such as the roles of the ruling party and the opposition often dominate such dynamics, whereas the U.S. legislature suffers from persistent ideological differences over particular issues between major political parties. The analysis confirms a strong influence of institutional differences on legislative debate in parliamentary democracies.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8258285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8258285","parliamentary politics;legislative debate;political polarization;topic models;latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA);comparative analysis","Speech;Computational modeling;Data models;Semantics;Bars;Resource management;Government","data analysis;government data processing;legislation;politics","Japanese Diet;Japanese political actors;political parties;legislative debate;cross-national measurement;political discourse;Japanese legislatures;political polarization;contemporary democratic societies;collective articulation;public agendas;polarization measures;United States Congress;floor debate analysis;topic modelling;speech records analysis;computational social science;big data;Natural Language Toolkit;Python","","4","","20","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we employ an unsupervised topic model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to explore patterns of gene expression in healthy and cancer tissues. An important advantage of LDA compared to alternative statistical and machine learning methods is its proven ability to handle sparse inputs over an extremely large numbers of features in an unsupervised manner. LDA has been recently applied for clustering and exploring genomic data but not for classification and prediction. In this paper, we try to optimize the protocol and parameters for efficient implementation of LDA. Here, messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence data from breast cancer and healthy tissue is used to determine an effective approach for the application of LDA to classification of cancer versus healthy tissue. We describe our study in two phases: First, various parameters like the number of topics, bins and passes were optimized for LDA. Next we developed a novel LDA-based classification approach to classify unknown samples based on similarity of co-expression patterns. Evaluation to assess the effectiveness of this approach shows that LDA can achieve high accuracy compared to alternative approaches. Overall, our results project LDA as a promising approach for classification of tissue types based on gene expression data in cancer studies.","2471-7819","978-1-5386-1324-5","10.1109/BIBE.2017.00-81","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8251263","Topic modeling;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Classification;Machine learning;Cancer;Gene expression","Gene expression;Bioinformatics;Data models;Breast cancer;Resource management;Text mining","biological tissues;biology computing;cancer;genetics;genomics;molecular biophysics;pattern classification;pattern clustering;RNA;statistical analysis","healthy tissues;cancer tissues;gene expression data classification;genomic data clustering;breast cancer;messenger RNA sequence data;clustering;unsupervised topic model;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;co-expression patterns","","3","","30","","11 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Aims: Change Impact Analysis (CIA) refers to the identification of source code files impacted when implementing a change request. We extend this question to predict not only affected files, but also the effort needed for implementing the change, and the duration necessary for that. Method: This study evaluates the performance of three textual similarity techniques for CIA based on Bag of words in combination with either topic modeling or file coupling. Results: The approaches are applied on data from two industrial projects. The data comes as part of an industrial collaboration project with Brightsquid, a Canadian start-up company specializing in secure communication solutions. Performance analysis shows that combining textual similarity with file coupling improves impact prediction, resulting in Recall of 67%. Effort and duration can be predicted with 84% and 72% accuracy using textual similarity only. Conclusions: The relative effort invested into CIA for predicting impacted files can be reduced by extending its applicability to multiple dimensions which include impacted files, effort, and duration.","","978-1-5090-4039-1","10.1109/ESEM.2017.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8170093","Change Impact Analysis;Case Study;Software Repository;Topic Modeling;Bag of Words;Effort estimation","Software;Couplings;Dentistry;Predictive models;Postal services;Companies;Collaboration","formal specification;formal verification;program diagnostics;public domain software;software maintenance;software performance evaluation;source code (software);systems analysis","software requirements;Canadian start-up company;topic modeling;bag of words;source code files identification;MVP;minimum viable product;vector impact prediction;change impact analysis;performance analysis;industrial collaboration project;file coupling;textual similarity techniques;change request;CIA;specialized functionality;start-ups;evolving products;Brightsquid;industrial case study","","2","","29","","11 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is no such authority which will provide them feasibility information. So, investors can be helped by providing them feasibility information about locations for cryptocurrency investment around the world. This paper aims to provide the aforementioned information to the investors. The proposed methodology is based on Topic modeling along with public opinion mining about cryptocurrencies, blockchain network, bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. The crawled data for other cryptocurrencies are much insufficient, so that are excluded from the study. In the proposed methodology, the top locations where cryptocurrency is widely used are identified, then in that particular locations' users concerns along with their sentiment analyses are investigated. Top locations are identified such as Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, and the USA etc. Almost 83.7% tweets of Sweden show positive sentiment for cryptocurrency investment which ranks as the highest having friendly environment for cryptocurrency investment. Similarly, the UK shows the least positive perception of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology usage. Some of the noteworthy terms found are legitimacy, authorization rules, volatility, profit, investment, and fluctuations. Which describe the users' concerns/ interests' about cryptocurrency. Investors can focus on all these areas during business.

Despite their growing popularity, existing challenges in employing these technologies have not been documented, and it is hard for individuals and companies to weigh benefits and pros against drawbacks and cons.In this paper, we address this issue by investigating the challenges that developers frequently experience when adopting desktop web app frameworks. To achieve this goal, we mine and apply topic modeling techniques to a dataset of 10,822 Stack Overflow posts related to the development of desktop web applications. Analyzing the resulting topics, we found that: i) developers often experience issues regarding the build and deployment processes for multiple platforms; ii) reusing existing libraries and development tools in the context of desktop applications is often cumbersome; iii) it is hard to solve issues that arise when interacting with native APIs. Furthermore, we confirm our finding by providing evidence that the identified issues are also present in the issue reports of 453 open-source applications publicly hosted on GitHub.","2574-3864","978-1-7281-8710-5","10.1109/MSR52588.2021.00039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463138","Web technologies;Desktop apps;Stack Over-flow;GitHub;Topic modeling","Knowledge engineering;Companies;Tools;Libraries;Data mining;Open source software;Software development management","application program interfaces;data mining;Internet;mobile computing;public domain software;software engineering","API;software companies;frictionless experience;cross-platform apps;Stack Overflow posts;desktop Web applications;desktop applications;desktop Web app frameworks;development tools;open-source applications;GitHub;topic modeling techniques","","2","","45","","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current aspect detection and sentiment analysis system largely relies on labelled data and also categorize the aspects manually. So, in this research, we proposed a hybrid text analytical framework to do aspect level public sentiments analysis. Our approach consists of three layers, first we extracted and clustered the aspects from the data by utilizing the widely used Latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modelling, then we extracted the sentiments and label the dataset by using the linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) lexicon, then in third layer of our framework we mapped the aspects into sentiments and sentiments are then classified with well-known machine learning classifiers.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a major outbreak in January 2020 and was followed by different preventive measures, lockdown, and finally by the process of vaccination. To date, more comprehensive analysis of news related to COVID-19 pandemic are missing, especially those which explain what aspects of this pandemic are being reported by newspapers inserted in different economies and belonging to different political alignments. Since LDA is often less coherent when there are news articles published across the world about an event and you look answers for specific queries. It is because of having semantically different content. To address this challenge, we performed pooling of news articles based on information retrieval using TF-IDF score in a data processing step and topic modeling using LDA with combination of 1 to 6 ngrams. We used VADER sentiment analyzer to analyze the differences in sentiments in news articles reported across different geographical places. The novelty of this study is to look at how COVID-19 pandemic was reported by the media, providing a comparison among countries in different political and economic contexts. Our findings suggest that the news reporting by newspapers with different political alignment support the reported content.

Taking into account the need for a qualified BI&A workforce in the near future, an empirical study on the job postings was conducted in order to analyze the core competencies. The methodology was based on semantic content analysis implemented by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative method for probabilistic topic modeling.

This work aims to understand the QSE-related challenges perceived by developers. We perform an empirical study on Stack Exchange forums where developers post-QSE-related questions & answers and Github issue reports where developers raise QSE-related issues in practical quantum computing projects. Based on an existing taxonomy of question types on Stack Overflow, we first perform a qualitative analysis of the types of QSE-related questions asked on Stack Exchange forums. We then use automated topic modeling to uncover the topics in QSE-related Stack Exchange posts and GitHub issue reports. Our study highlights some particularly challenging areas of QSE that are different from that of traditional software engineering, such as explaining the theory behind quantum computing code, interpreting quantum program outputs, and bridging the knowledge gap between quantum computing and classical computing, as well as their associated opportunities.","2576-3148","978-1-6654-2882-8","10.1109/ICSME52107.2021.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609196","Quantum computing;Quantum software engineering;Topic modeling;Stack Exchange;Issue reports","Knowledge engineering;Software maintenance;Quantum computing;Codes;Computational modeling;Taxonomy;Quantum mechanics","quantum computing;software engineering","quantum computing code;quantum program;quantum software engineering challenges;quantum computing systems;software engineering community;practical quantum computing projects;GitHub issue reports;stack exchange forums;post-QSE-related questions & answers;automated topic modeling;quantum program outputs;QSE-related stack exchange posts;stack overflow","","","","84","","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The key problem of personalized news recommendation is to model users' interests and track their changes. A common way to deal with the user modeling problem is to build user profiles from observed behavior. However, the majority of existing methods make static representations of user profiles and little research has focused on effective user modeling that could dynamically capture user interests in news topics. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose UP-TreeRec, a news recommendation framework based on a user profile tree (UP-Tree), which is a novel framework combining content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. First, by exploiting a novel topic model namely UI-LDA, we obtain the representation vectors for news content in a topic space as the fundamental bridge to associate user interests with news topics. Next, we design a decision tree with a dynamically changeable structure to construct a user interest profile from the user's feedback. Furthermore, we present a clustering-based multidimensional similarity computation method to select the nearest neighbor of the UP-Tree efficiently. We also provide a Map-Reduce framework-based implementation that enables scaling our solution to real-world news recommendation problems. We conducted several experiments compared to the state-of-the-art approaches on real-world datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy and effectiveness in news recommendation.","1673-5447","","10.12676/j.cc.2019.04.017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8695430","News recommendation;user profiling;content-based recommendation;collaborative filtering","Adaptation models;Collaboration;Buildings;Decision trees;Recommender systems;Task analysis","collaborative filtering;content-based retrieval;data handling;decision trees;nearest neighbour methods;parallel processing;pattern clustering;recommender systems;user modelling","online news recommendation systems;personalized news recommendation;user modeling problem;user profile tree;topic model;news content;topic space;decision tree;user interest profile;clustering-based multidimensional similarity computation method;Map-Reduce framework-based implementation;UP-TreeRec;collaborative filtering techniques;content-based filtering techniques;UI-LDA;representation vectors;nearest neighbor selection;users feedback;dynamic user profiles tree building","","","","","","22 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

One major problem is the lack of word boundary in a sentence, introducing ambiguity in word tokenization. For topic extraction, semantic ambiguity adds another layer of complexity to the problem. Topic model that disregards word order, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), performs poorly in Thai Language. In this paper, we experimented and tested a probabilistic language model equipped with word location information, the so-called Topic N-grams model (TNG). We deployed several testing tasks to assess TNG's capabilities of modeling the generative process of Thai text and established benchmarks that compare the performance of LDA and TNG for various NLP tasks in Thai language. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to explore word-order model in Thai language topic extraction. We concluded that TNG can help boosting performance of Thai language processing in word cutting, semantic checking, word prediction, and document generation task. We also explored how we can measure performance of LDA and TNG on such tasks using perplexity.","","978-1-5386-5254-1","10.1109/ICBIR.2018.8391162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8391162","Topic Modeling;Word Cutting;Topic N-grams;LDA;TNG","Task analysis;Semantics;Probability distribution;Benchmark testing;Dictionaries;Random access memory","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;probability;text analysis","probabilistic learning models;natural language processing;word boundary;word tokenization;probabilistic language model;word location information;TNG;Thai text;word-order model;Thai language topic extraction;Thai language processing;word cutting;word prediction;NLP;latent Dirichlet allocation;LDA;topic N-grams model;semantic checking;document generation task","","2","","10","","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Aiming at understanding SAR images with very limited annotation and taking full advantage of complex-valued SAR data, this paper proposes a general and practical framework for quad-, dual-, and single-polarized SAR data. In this framework, two important elements are taken into consideration: image representation and physical scattering properties. Firstly, a convolutional neural network is applied for SAR image representation. Based on time-frequency analysis and polarimetric decomposition, the scattering labels are extracted from complex SAR data with unsupervised deep learning. Then, a bag of scattering topics for a patch is obtained via topic modeling. By assuming that the generated scattering topics can be regarded as the abstract attributes of SAR images, we propose a soft constraint between scattering topics and image representations to refine the network.

BAM covers various probabilistic nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) and topic models under one general framework. In BAM, allocations are made using a Bayesian network, whose conditional probability tables can be integrated out analytically. We show that, when allocations are viewed as sequential, the resulting marginal process is a special type of Polya urn process, which we name as Polya-Bayes process, an integer valued self-reinforcing process. Exploiting the Polya urn construction, we develop a novel sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm for marginal likelihood estimation in BAM, leading to a unified scoring method for discrete variable Bayesian networks with hidden nodes, including various NTF and topic models. The SMC estimator for marginal likelihood has the remarkable property of being unbiased in contrast to variational algorithms which are generally biased. We also demonstrate how our novel SMC-based likelihood estimation can be integrated within a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for a principled and correct (in terms of respecting the true posterior distribution) Bayesian model selection and hyperparameter estimation for BAM.

The coherence of a topic, used as a proxy for topic quality, is based on the distributional hypothesis that states that words with similar meaning tend to co-occur within a similar context. Although LDA has gained much attention from machine-learning researchers, most notably with its adaptations and extensions, little is known about the effects of different types of textual data on generated topics. Our research is the first to explore these practical effects and shows that document frequency, document word length, and vocabulary size have mixed practical effects on topic coherence and human topic ranking of LDA topics. We furthermore show that large document collections are less affected by incorrect or noise terms being part of the topic-word distributions, causing topics to be more coherent and ranked higher. Differences between abstract and full-text data are more apparent within small document collections, with differences as large as 90% high-quality topics for full-text data, compared to 50% high-quality topics for abstract data.","","978-1-5090-5004-8","10.1109/DSAA.2017.61","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8259775","Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Topic Coherence;Abstract;Full-Text","Coherence;Probabilistic logic;Resource management;Data models;Semantics;Adaptation models;Vocabulary","learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","topic coherence;high-quality topics;LDA topics;mixed practical effects;machine-learning researchers;topic quality;topic model;uncovered latent topics;human topic ranking;latent Dirichlet allocation;topic coherence scores;abstract data;full-text data;topic-word distributions;document collections","","59","","43","","18 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recognizing sarcastic statements can be very useful as it enhances the efficiency of after-sales services or consumer assistance through understanding the intentions and real opinions of consumers when browsing their feedbacks or complaints. In this paper we propose a system that will measure sarcasm using tweets from Twitter. We propose different algorithms to calculate the effect of sarcasm on texts and generate a score. Different features are generated from the received tweets which helps us to generate the score. At the end, we compare the scores from different algorithms to present the most efficient way to detect sarcasm.

When used to obtain query-relevant clusters, QS3M achieves a 12% performance improvement on the TREC datasets over a strong BERT-based reference method and many baselines such as TF-IDF and topic models. A similar improvement is observed for the arXiv dataset suggesting the general applicability of QS3M to different domains. Qualitative evaluation is carried out to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of the model.

Due to the unprecedented scale and the cascading power of the underlying social networks, social media has created a new paradigm for sharing information, broadcasting breaking news, and reporting real-time events by any user from anywhere at any time. Many popular social media sites including Twitter provide streaming data services by standard APIs to the broad researcher and developer communities. Given the sheer data volume, rapid velocity, and feature variety of online social media, these sites often supply only a sampled set of streaming data, rather than the full data set to reduce the resource cost of computations, storage, and network bandwidth. In light of the substantial impact of sampling in Twitter data stream, this article explores a combination of spectral clustering, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling, and differential equation modeling to mitigate the impact of sampling on social media data analysis, in particular on detecting real-world events and predicting information diffusion.

Hence, this work explores the incorporation of hashtags and sentiment analysis (also taking into account conversational context) in the input graph for community detection through various schemes. Evaluation was performed by investigating the modularity score, topic similarity/variety, and sentiment homogeneity of the resulting communities. Results suggest that when compared to a baseline graph based on mentions, a scoring approach is more likely to yield a different set of communities compared to the more popular edge-weighting approach.

An advantage of a neural language model is that it can be further applied to other NLP tasks where the training datasets may be limited. In this talk, we realize this idea by introducing the usage of a Vietnamese neural model language trained from a large corpus of social media data.

Traditional methods seldom systematically combine static attributes (e.g., interests, geographical locations, and common friends), dynamic behaviors (e.g., liking, making comments, forwarding and @), and network structures (e.g., social ties) to recommend a new friend to a target user. Meanwhile, with the advent of deep learning, it has become more challenging to integrate these features into a deep neural network framework for friend recommendation. For example, how do we optimally make use of these features to form a united framework and what type of deep neural network architecture should be introduced into a novel recommendation method in an edge computing environment? In this paper, we propose DFRec++, a hybrid deep neural network framework combining attribute attention and network embeddings to make social friend recommendations with the help of both interactive semantics and contextual enhancement. More specifically, we first utilize the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model to generate common interest topics between users and compute the similarity of the explicit static attribute vector representation of topics, locations, and common friends. Then we feed dynamic behavior attributes into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to obtain the implicit vector representation of the interactions and context between two users. Subsequently, a multi-attention mechanism is designed to further improve the deep vector representation of the attribute information. Next, the LINE-based network embeddings algorithm is applied to embed the network structure into a low-dimensional vector. Finally, the attribute attention vector and the network embeddings are concatenated to form a deep feature representation, which is subsequently fed to a fully connected neural network (FCNN) to capture the probability of friendship between two users. The output of FCNN indicates the probability of two users becoming friends. We conducted experiments on a real-world Weibo dataset and the results show that DFRec++ outperforms several existing methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2958599","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFB2101003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51822802,U1811463,51778033); China Geological Survey(grant numbers:DD20190637); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8930557","Friend recommendation;deep neural network;attribute-specific multi-attention mechanism;network embedding;convolutional neural network","Neural networks;Social networking (online);Feature extraction;Edge computing;Data mining;Laboratories;Urban areas","learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture;probability;recommender systems;social networking (online)","DFRec++;FCNN;LDA topic model;deep feature representation;attribute attention vector;LINE-based network embeddings algorithm;deep vector representation;convolutional neural network;common interest topics;latent Dirichlet allocation topic model;social friend recommendations;hybrid deep neural network framework;recommendation method;deep neural network architecture;deep learning;network structure;dynamic behavior;common friends;static attributes;quality-driven resource processing;service recommendations;social networks;edge computing environment;friend recommendation;fully connected neural network","","6","","47","CCBY","10 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, the text is reconstructed into a set of co-occurrence words. Then Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model is used to extract the topic words to calculate the semantic similarity between the documents and the threat actions, which is taken as the document features. Finally, the problem of threat actions extraction is transformed into multi-label classification problem, and several machine learning algorithms are used to complete the extraction of threat actions in articles related to cybersecurity events.

Topic modeling approaches such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) has been applied quite successfully in extracting topics. However, there still exists several directions for further improvement. Short texts (e.g. tweets and news titles) present the problem of data sparsity for LDA. Second, there needs to be greater transparency in the process of topic discovery in order to enhance interpretability for humans. Third, the robustness of the model needs to be further enhanced to avoid sensitivity to the choice of hyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel geometric approach based on convex polytopic model (CPM) which can discover representative and interpretable topical features from the given corpus. By embedding all documents into a low-dimensional affine subspace, we show that the topics can be obtained geometrically as the vertices of a compact polytope which encloses all the embedded documents. We further interpret the features acquired as topics and use them to obtain a convex polytopic document representation for every document. We studied the properties of CPM by two small corpora of short texts. Results reveal that the proposed CPM can discover interpretable topics even for short texts. We also discover that the geometric nature of CPM enhances model transparency and topic interpretability, as well as robustness to hyper-parameter selection.","2380-7350","978-1-5386-7094-1","10.1109/CogInfoCom.2018.8639887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8639887","Topic discovery;document categorization;text representation;convex polytope","Feature extraction;Semantics;Hidden Markov models;Robustness;Task analysis;Analytical models;Principal component analysis","text analysis","topic discovery;convex polytopic model;text processing;topic modeling approaches;latent Dirichlet allocation;CPM;representative features;interpretable topical features;convex polytopic document representation;interpretable topics;topic interpretability","","1","","10","","14 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In practice, researchers usually prefer to cite the most topic-relevant articles. Nevertheless, how to model the implicit correlations between topics and citations is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel citation recommendation model, called TopicCite, which mines such fine-grained correlations. We extract various citation features from citation network, and integrate the learning process of feature regression with topic modeling. At the recommendation stage, we expand the folding-in process by adding the topic influence of papers that correlated with user-provided information. TopicCite can also be considered a technique for extracting topic-related citation features from manually defined citation features, which can essentially improve the granularity of pre-extracted features. In addition, the unsupervised topic model is supervised and mutually reinforced by abundant citation features in TopicCite; thus, the proposed model can also extract more reliable topic distributions from citation data, which brings a new perspective to topic discovery on linked data. The experimental results on the AAN and DBLP datasets demonstrate that our model is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2884981","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61373046); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:S2015YFJM2129); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8558574","Citation recommendation;topic model;feature regression","Feature extraction;Task analysis;Data models;Data mining;Collaboration;Correlation;Linked data","","","","9","","51","OAPA","4 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

People begin to use multiple online social networks simultaneously for different demands. The ability to uncover a user’s latent topic and social network preference is critical for community detection, recommendation, and personalized service across social networks. Unfortunately, most current works focus on the single network, necessitating new technology and models to address this issue. This paper proposes a user preference discovery model on multiple social networks. Firstly, the global and local topic concepts are defined, then a latent semantic topic discovery method is used to obtain global and local topic word distributions, along with user topic and social network preferences. After that, the topic distribution characteristics of different social networks are examined, as well as the reasons why users choose one network over another to create a post. Next, a Gibbs sampling algorithm is adopted to obtain the model parameters. In the experiment, we collect data from Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr websites to build a dataset of multiple social networks. Finally, we compare our research to previous works, and both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results have demonstrated the effectiveness.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671607","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671607","topic discovery;topic modeling;social network;user model;data fusion","Social networking (online);Conferences;Semantics;Multimedia Web sites;Data preprocessing;Blogs;Big Data","sampling methods;social networking (online);text analysis","user topic preferences;multiple online social networks;social network preference;user preference discovery model;global topic concepts;local topic concepts;latent semantic topic discovery method;global topic word distributions;local topic word distributions;topic distribution characteristics;Gibbs sampling algorithm","","","","26","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, existing schemes may also lack support for semantic-awareness in the dynamic setting. To address these limitations, we propose a Secure Semantic-aware Spatial Keyword Search scheme that supports Dynamic update (3SKSD). Specifically, we leverage the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model and secure $k$ Nearest Neighbor ($k$NN) method to help us achieve both efficiency and security. We also construct an encrypted R-tree structure to facilitate SKS and dynamic update. Moreover, we propose an advanced scheme with forward security on the basis of 3SKSD, with the aim of minimizing privacy leakage due to dynamic updates.

However, graphs (i.e., networks) in the real world are usually text-rich, implying that valuable semantic information needs to be carefully considered. Existing GNNs for text-rich networks typically treat text as attribute words alone, which inevitably leads to the loss of important semantic structures, limiting the representation capability of GNNs. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end adaptive semantic architecture of graph convolutional networks, namely AS-GCN, which unifies neural topic model and graph convolutional networks, for text-rich network representation. Specifically, we utilize a neural topic model to extract the global topic semantics, and accordingly augment the original text-rich network into a tri-typed heterogeneous network, capturing both the local word-sequence semantic structure and the global topic semantic structure from text. We then design an effective semantic-aware propagation of information by introducing a discriminative convolution mechanism. We further propose two strategies, that is, distribution sharing and joint training, to adaptively generate a proper network structure based on the learning objective to improve network representation. Extensive experiments on text-rich networks illustrate that our new architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant improvement.

Open innovation and crowdsourcing platforms are becoming an arena for designers to test their solutions in business competitions. We show how structural topical modeling identifies topical themes that improve contestant performance using forum message data during the competition period. Our topic modeling analysis identifies technological and business issues that emerge in recommendation system development. An econometric framework further investigates the link between topic distribution and performance. The multiperiod difference-in-differences estimator reports no significant statistical relation when linking all message communications to the performance. However, topic-dominant and topic-dispersed messages are both found to positively and significantly impact performance. Our result shows that structural topical modeling has an essential role to critically examine the most valuable message links to boost performance.

There are intensive studies of word representation learning for question classification. As questions are typically short texts, existing techniques are often not effective for extracting discriminative representations of questions just from a limited number of words. This motivates us to exploit additional information beyond words in order to improve the representation learning of questions. On one hand, topic modeling often captures meaningful semantic structures from the question corpus. Such global topical information should be helpful for question representations. On the other hand, entities extracted from question themselves provide more auxiliary information for short texts from a local viewpoint. Together with words, topics and entities, question representations can be substantially improved.In this paper, we propose a unified neural network framework by integrating Topic modeling, Word embedding and Entity Embedding (TWEE) for question representation learning. Concretely, we introduce a novel topic sparse autoencoder to incorporate discriminative topics into the representation learning of questions. In addition, both words and entity related information are embedded into the network to help learn a more comprehensive question representation. Empirical experiments show that the proposed TWEE framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on different datasets.","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622331","Representation Learning;Topic Sparse Autoen-coder;Entity Embedding;Question Classification","Biological system modeling;Neural networks;Decoding;Big Data;Context modeling;Cost function;Semantics","feature extraction;knowledge representation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;text analysis","question classification;deep learning models;word representation learning;topic modeling;question representation learning;entity embedding;topic sparse autoencoder;neural network framework;word embedding","","2","","29","","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, latent dirichlet allocation topic model is utilized for classifying the image database. Second, the images belonging to one topic are selected, and 8 × 8 block discrete cosine transform is performed to these images. Then robust feature sequence is generated through the relation between direct current coefficients in the adjacent blocks. Finally, an inverted index which contains the feature sequence, dc, location coordinates, and image path is created. For the purpose of achieving image steganography, the secret information is converted into a binary sequence and partitioned into segments, and the image whose feature sequence equals to the secret information segments is chosen as the cover image according to the index. After that, all cover images are sent to the receiver. In the whole process, no modification is done to the original images. Experimental results and analysis show that the proposed algorithm can resist the detection of existing steganalysis algorithms, and has better robustness against common image processing and better ability to resist steganalysis compared with the existing coverless image steganography algorithms. Meanwhile, it is resistant to geometric attacks to some extent.

Traditional methods such as Dynamic Topic Modeling (DTM) do not lend themselves well to direct parallelization because of dependencies from one time step to another. In this paper, we introduce and empirically analyze Clustered Latent Dirichlet Allocation (CLDA), a method for extracting dynamic latent topics from a collection of documents. Our approach is based on data decomposition in which the data is partitioned into segments, followed by topic modeling on the individual segments. The resulting local models are then combined into a global solution using clustering. The decomposition and resulting parallelization leads to very fast runtime even on very large datasets. Our approach furthermore provides insight into how the composition of topics changes over time and can also be applied using other data partitioning strategies over any discrete features of the data, such as geographic features or classes of users. In this paper CLDA is applied successfully to seventeen years of NIPS conference papers (2,484 documents and 3,280,697 words), seventeen years of computer science journal abstracts (533,588 documents and 46,446,184 words), and to forty years of the PubMed corpus (4,025,976 documents and 386,847,695 words). On the PubMed corpus, we demonstrate the versatility of CLDA by segmenting the data by both time and by journal. Our runtime on this corpus demonstrates an ability to function on very large scale datasets.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9005964","topic modeling;big data;scientific discovery","Resource management;Data models;Runtime;Big Data;Measurement;Task analysis;Dynamic scheduling","data mining;natural language processing;pattern clustering;text analysis","NIPS conference papers;latent Dirichlet allocation;intelligent systems;sense-making;text data;dynamic latent topics;data decomposition;local models;parallelization;data partitioning strategies;geographic features;CLDA","","2","","35","","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to authorship attribution as the main task, we introduce a novel auxiliary task topic approximation to guide the learning of topic representations with the topic distributions inferred by topic models, which are trained from external corpus. Moreover, we propose a competitive attention mechanism and a separation-reconstruction constraint to assign different and competitive attentions to two tasks in order to separate topic and style as much as possible. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-task learning based method is promising, especially on cross-topic settings.

It is expected that the involvement of correlations can increase the discriminative capability of the learned generative model and consequently improve the recognition accuracy. Incorporated with the Fisher kernel method, correlated topic vector inherits the advantages of Fisher vector. The contributions to the topics of visual words have been further employed by incorporating the Fisher kernel framework to indicate the differences among scenes. Combined with the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) features and Gibbs sampling solution, correlated topic vector shows great potential when processing large-scale and complex scene image data sets.

Sometimes these tags are human-generated, sometimes they are machine-generated. The evaluation of the tagging quality is an important problem. We propose a simple metrics of tagging consistency for scientific papers: whether these tags are predictive of citations. Since the authors tend to cite papers about the topics close to those of their publications, a consistent tagging should be able to predict citations. We present an algorithm to calculate consistency, and show experiments with human-and machine-generated tags.

Analyzing the behavior of programs is a difficult task, since there is no clear sequence of actions during the execution of which it is possible to unambiguously identify a program as malicious. In addition, such programs counteract detection through behavior analysis, for example, by noisy sequence of execution with meaningless actions. There is also the problem of uniquely identifying the class of malware because these programs can use similar methods, while being assigned to different classes. In this paper, it is proposed to use NLP (Natural Language Processing) methods, such as word embedding, and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) in relation to the tasks of analyzing sequences of malicious API (Application Programming Interface) calls. The results obtained indicate the possibility of identifying the key features of the behavior of malicious programs, which in the future will make it possible to use these features for monitoring malicious programs using machine learning.","","978-1-6654-3981-7","10.1109/SUMMA53307.2021.9632005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9632005","word embedding;natural language processing;latent dirichlet allocation;API call;malware;n-gram;topic modeling;vector representation;clustering","Neural networks;Semantics;Machine learning;Malware;Natural language processing;Mathematical models;Security","application program interfaces;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;telecommunication security","programs counteract detection;behavior analysis;noisy sequence;meaningless actions;NLP methods;Natural Language Processing;word embedding;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;malicious API calls;Application Programming Interface;monitoring malicious programs;machine learning;API sequences;malware monitoring;neural networks;behavioral analysis technology;malware security threats","","","","17","IEEE","10 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose LDA-Reg, a novel knowledge driven regularization framework based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as an alternative to the word embedding methods to adaptively utilize abundant external knowledge and to interpret the NN model. For the joint learning of the parameters, we propose EM-SGD, an effective update method which incorporates Expectation Maximization (EM) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to update parameters iteratively. Moreover, we also devise a lazy update and sparse update method for the high-dimensional inputs and sparse inputs respectively. We validate the effectiveness of our regularization framework through an extensive experimental study over real world and standard benchmark datasets.

Characterized by progressive respiratory failure and a median patient survival time of three to five years, this disease affects 150,000 patients in the United States (US) and results in 40,000 deaths annually. While the US mortality rate for IPF is similar to breast cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis remains characterized as a rare disease. Lack of awareness and information for lesser known diseases such as IPF can affect factors ranging from proper diagnosis to the advancement of the drug development pipeline. One platform which may improve insight into the patient experience is that of social networks. Even in light of recent privacy concerns, social networks provide a well-known platform for clinicians, patients, and advocates to interact and provide feedback in real-time. Unlike other patient reporting and survey instruments which reach limited populations, social networks remain unique in their ability to reach larger, diverse cohorts. Although many studies have evaluated and characterized different online patient communities, limited efforts have addressed the applicability of social network data for insight into critical quality of life dimensions.

Research shows that developers writing DL software have specific development stages (i.e., SE4DL stages) and face new DL-specific problems. Despite substantial research, it is not clear how such needs vary over stages, DL application types, or if they change over time. To help focus research and development efforts on DL-development challenges, we analyze 92,830 Stack Overow (SO) questions and 227,756 READMEs of public repositories related to DL. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) reveals 27 topics for the SO questions with 19 (70.4%) topics primarily relating to a single SE4DL stage and eight topics spanning multiple stages. Most questions concern Data Preparation and Model Setup stages. The relative rates of questions for 11 topics have increased, for eight topics decreased over time. Questions for the former 11 topics had a lower percentage of having an accepted answer than for the remaining topics. LDA on README les reveals 16 distinct application types for the 227k repositories. We apply the LDA model fitted on READMEs to the 92,830 SO questions and find that 27% of the questions are related to the 16 DL application types. The distribution of topics with the most questions vary with application types, with half topics relating to the second and third stages. Specifically, developers ask the most questions about topics relating to Data Preparation (2nd) stage for four mature application types such as Image Segmentation, and topics relating to Model Setup (3rd) stage for four application types concerning emerging methods such as Transfer Learning.

Yet, there are many images in which some regions cannot be assigned a crisp categorical label (e.g., transition regions between a foggy sky and the ground or between sand and water at a beach). In these cases, a visual word is best represented with partial memberships across multiple topics. To address this, we present a partial membership LDA (PM-LDA) model and an associated parameter estimation algorithm.

Since there are a large quantity of products on each platform, it is necessary to classify the products based on their short descriptions and to learn the relationships between the different categories on multiple platforms. In this paper, we propose the Rectified Topic Classification model to classify products into hierarchical categories based on their short text descriptions. We adopt the topic model to capture the latent features of products from the noisy short descriptions generated by merchants. To reduce the uncertainty of the inferring topic features of a new product, we invoke the topic model several times to get a set of probabilistic feature results and adopt the convolutional neural network for classification. To learn the correlations between two platform categories, the mapping matrix is learned by using a set of seed products. We crawled several real datasets from popular e-commerce platforms and perform experiments to verify our methods. The results show that our method outperforms the related methods.","","978-1-7281-0350-1","10.1109/CSCWD.2019.8791500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8791500","product classification;topic model;hierarchy","Probabilistic logic;Vocabulary;Uncertainty;Correlation;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks","convolutional neural nets;electronic commerce;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;pattern classification;probability;text analysis","latent features;noisy short descriptions;seed products;electronic commerce;product comparison services;user reference;short text descriptions;topic features;probabilistic feature;short text based cooperative classification;rectified topic classification model;convolutional neural network;matrix mapping","","","","25","","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, confined by the data’s sparsity and high-dimensionality, limited effort has been made to explore the semantic structures underlying the document representation that formulates each document as a sequence of one-hot vectors, especially in the probabilistic modeling literature. To construct a probabilistic generative model for this type of document representation, we first develop convolutional Poisson factor analysis (CPFA) that not only utilizes the sparse property of data but also enables model parallelism. Through interleaving probabilistic Dirichlet-gamma pooling layers with learnable parameters, we extend the shallow CPFA into a generative text convolutional neural network (GTCNN), which captures richer semantic information with multiple probabilistic convolutional layers and can be coupled with existing deep topic models to alleviate their loss of word order. For efficient and scalable model inference, we not only develop both a parallel upward-downward Gibbs sampler and SG-MCMC based algorithm for training GTCNN, but also construct a hierarchical Weibull convolutional inference network for fast out-of-sample prediction. Experimental results on document representation learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2022.3192319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9833334","Document analysis;deep topic models;probabilistic convolutional generative models;variational autoencoder","Probabilistic logic;Computational modeling;Semantics;Analytical models;Task analysis;Vocabulary;Data models","","","","","","","IEEE","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This abstract information leads towards the identification of the topics in the document. One way to retrieve topics from documents is keyphrase extraction. Keyphrases are a set of terms which represent high level description of a document. Different techniques of keyphrase extraction for topic prediction have been proposed for multiple languages i.e. English, Arabic, etc. However, this area needs to be explored for other languages e.g. Urdu. Therefore, in this paper, a novel unsupervised approach for topic prediction for Urdu language has been introduced which is able to extract more significant information from the documents. For this purpose, the proposed TOP-Rank system extracts keywords from the document and ranks them according to their position in a sentence. These keywords along with their ranking scores are utilized to generate keyphrases by applying syntactic rules to extracts more meaningful topics. These keyphrases are ranked according to the keywords scores and re-ranked with respect to their positions in the document. Finally, our proposed model identifies top-ranked keyphrases as topical significance and keyphrase with the highest score is selected as the topic of the document.

Topic mixture well represents documents while words mixture extracts meaningful topics from a corpus. The nature of LDA makes it a powerful tool in documents organizing and corpus summarizing. One limitation of LDA is that its performance depends heavily on the priors. Researchers show priors matters in LDA and propose methods to learn the priors for better modeling, regardless of using symmetric priors. However, LDA modeling ability does not necessarily consent with the performance of LDA in documents representation and topic extraction. In this paper, we propose a novel prior setting for LDA. The setting improves LDA in both documents representation and topic extraction performance. We experiment to compare our setting with symmetric priors and previously proposed priors that enhances modeling ability. Experiments on the topic quality show that LDA with our prior setting extracts better topics than LDA with other kinds of prior settings. We compare LDA document representation ability through tasks such as document clustering and document classification. These experiments demonstrate LDA with our proposed priors represents document better.

One of the big challenges in topic modeling is determining the correct number of topics: underestimating the number of topics results in a loss of information, i.e., omission of topics, underfitting, while overestimating leads to noisy and unexplainable topics and overfitting. In this paper, we consider a semantic-assisted non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) topics model, which we call SeNMFk, based on Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence and integrated with a method for determining the number of latent topics. SeNMFk involves (i) creating a random ensemble of pairs of matrices whose mean is equal to the initial words-by-documents matrix representing the text corpus and the Shifted Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (SPPMI) matrix, which encodes the context information, respectively, and (ii) jointly factorizing each of these pairs with different number of topics to acquire sets of latent topics that are stable to noise. We demonstrate the performance of our method by identifying the number of topics in several benchmark text corpora, when compared to other state-of-the-art techniques. We also show that the number of document classes in the input text corpus may differ from the number of the extracted latent topics, but these classes can be retrieved by clustering the column-vectors of one of the factor matrices. Additionally, we introduce a software called pyDNMFk to estimate the number of topics. We demonstrate that our unsupervised method, SeNMFk, not only determines the correct number of topics, but also extracts topics with a high coherence and accurately classifies the documents of the corpus.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3106879","Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)—Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development (NA-22); LANL Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD)(grant numbers:20190020DR); Los Alamos National Laboratory Institutional Computing Program; U.S. Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration(grant numbers:89233218CNA000001); Science and Education for Smart Growth Operational Program (2014–2020)(grant numbers:BG05M2OP001-1.001-0003); European Union through the European Structural and Investment Funds; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9521777","Machine learning;NLP;topic modeling;semantic non-negative matrix factorization","Semantics;Analytical models;Probabilistic logic;Stability analysis;Data models;Coherence;Minimization","","","","1","","64","CCBY","24 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, the fundamental factors that drive the generation of social networks (i.e., the network topology and content) and community structures have not been well investigated. In this paper, according to the natural characteristics of social networks, we reveal that individual topics play a core role in community generation. If two individuals are in the same community and are interested in similar topics, it is more likely that a link will form between them. Otherwise, the probability of generating a link depends on the relationships between their communities and the topics they talk about. Based on the above observations, a novel generative community detection model is proposed that simulates the generation of the network topology and network content by considering individual topics. Moreover, our model utilizes a topic model to generate network content. The model is evaluated on two real-world datasets.

Taking advantage of machine learning models and deep learning methods, researchers dive into symptom analysis, disease prediction and medicine law. The combination of TCM herbs is the essential basis for compatibility of clinical prescriptions and its research has attracted plenty of attention. However, literature on herb recommendation for clinical diagnosis, to our best knowledge, is slightly lacking. The clinical herbs collocation will be chosen by doctors in consideration of not only the characteristics and pharmacodynamics of the herbs, but also the mutual effects formed with other herbs. Based on the real clinical prescription data, this paper constructs an analytical model to represent the relationship between prescription herbs and syndromes, and develops herb recommendation model. Firstly, by constructing a modeling process based on the LDA topic model, this paper shows the analysis model and presentation method for prescription herbs. Then, based on the mentioned modeling, we propose a double-end fusion recommendation framework, including methods of adjusting weight proportion and similarity remapping. This research conducts experiments on relevant outpatient medical record data, which confirm that the proposed model can reflect the basic principles of herb combination in clinical diagnosis and the proposed fusion recommendation model has good performance in evaluation metrics.","","978-1-5386-9497-8","10.1109/ICDH.2018.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8634779","Traditional Chinese Medical Data Mining;Prescription Herb Modeling;Herb Recommendation","Data models;Medical diagnostic imaging;Analytical models;Hidden Markov models;Diseases;Data mining","data mining;diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;medicine;patient diagnosis;patient treatment;recommender systems","LDA topic model;analysis model;presentation method;prescription herbs;mentioned modeling;fusion recommendation framework;relevant outpatient medical record data;herb combination;clinical diagnosis;fusion recommendation model;herb pair recommendation;data mining research;machine learning models;deep learning methods;medicine law;TCM herbs;clinical herbs collocation;clinical prescription data;analytical model;herb recommendation model;modeling process;data-driven traditional Chinese medicine clinical herb modeling","","6","","11","","7 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Dynamic topic modeling has been widely used in social and data sciences with the goal of learning latent topics that emerge, evolve, and fade over time. Previous work on dynamic topic modeling primarily employ the method of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), where slices of the data tensor are each factorized into the product of lower dimensional nonnegative matrices. With this approach, however, noise can have devastating effects on the learned latent topics and obscure the true topics in the data. To overcome this issue, we propose instead adopting the method of nonnegative CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition (NNCPD), where the data tensor is directly decomposed into a minimal sum of outer products of nonnegative vectors. We show experimental evidence that suggests that NNCPD is robust to noise in the data when one overestimates the CP rank of the tensor.","2642-7338","978-1-7281-4190-9","10.1109/ITA50056.2020.9244932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9244932","","Tensors;Data analysis;Gaussian noise;Robustness;Data models;Matrix decomposition;Information theory","Big Data;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;tensors","learned latent topics;data tensor;nonnegative vectors;nonnegative CP tensor decomposition;temporal data analysis;dynamic topic modeling;nonnegative matrix factorization;CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor decomposition;big data analysis","","","","13","","6 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this issue, we present an automated aggregation method which adopts a kind of probabilistic weight instead of the subjective weight in previous aggregation methods. In particular, we utilize a topic modeling technique to estimate the probabilistic weight by learning from a software benchmark. In this manner, our approach can enable automated quality assessment by using the learned knowledge without manual effort. In addition, we conduct an application on the maintainability assessment of the systems in our benchmark. The result shows that our approach can reveal the maintainability well through a correlation analysis with the changed lines of code.","","978-1-5386-1589-8","10.1109/ICSE-C.2017.139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7965326","","Measurement;Correlation;Probabilistic logic;Benchmark testing;Software quality;Mathematical model","learning (artificial intelligence);software quality","automated aggregation method;software quality model;high-level abstract quality characteristics;low-level metrics;weighted linear aggregation method;topic modeling technique;software benchmark;system maintainability assessment","","1","","20","","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, with accumulation of users and contents, much concern has arisen over the efficiency and answer quality of CQA services. To address this problem, question routing has been proposed which aims at routing new questions to suitable answerers, who have both high possibility and high ability to answer the questions. In this paper, we formulate question routing as a multi-objective ranking problem, and present a multi-objective learning-to-rank approach for question routing (MLQR), which can simultaneously optimize the answering possibility and answer quality of routed users. In MLQR, realizing that questions are relatively short and usually attached with tags, we first propose a tagword topic model (TTM) to derive topical representations of questions. Based on TTM, we then develop features for each question-user pair, which are captured at both platform level and thread level. In particular, the platform-level features summarize the information of a user from his/her history posts in the CQA platform, while the thread-level features model the pairwise competitions of a user with others in his/her answered threads. Finally, we extend a state-of-the-art learning-to-rank algorithm for training a multi-objective ranking model. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that our MLQR can outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of both answering possibility and answer quality.","2375-026X","978-1-5386-5520-7","10.1109/ICDE.2018.00240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8509461","Community question answering services;question routing;multiple objective optimization","Routing;Knowledge discovery;Feature extraction;Training;Optimization;Resource management;History","learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;question answering (information retrieval);statistical analysis","community question answering services;tagword topic model;TTM;topical representations;CQA platform;multiobjective learning-to-rank approach for question routing;MLQR;simultaneously optimisation;multiobjective optimization approach;multiobjective ranking model;question-user pair;routed users;answering possibility;multiobjective ranking problem;question routing","","","","9","","25 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To leverage this meta-information, we propose a supervised topic compositional neural language model, called MeTRNN, that integrates the strength of supervised topic modeling in capturing global semantics with the capacity of contextual recurrent neural networks (RNN) in modeling local word dependencies. MeTRNN generates interpretable topics from global meta-information and uses them to facilitate contextual RNNs in modeling local dependencies of text. For efficient training of MeTRNN, we develop an autoencoding variational Bayes inference method. We evaluate MeTRNN on the word prediction tasks using public text datasets. MeTRNN consistently outperforms all baselines across all datasets in perplexity ranging from 5% to 40%.

This problem of information complexity in research is present in other disciplines, creating a demand for a system to increase both effectiveness and efficiency of research. In this paper, we propose a system, the Research Assistant Management Platform (RAMP), to assist analysts in their duties in retrieving relevant maritime information. The platform is a realization of a proof of concept utilizing a database backend for storage of Requests for Intelligence, real-time updating topic models for document similarity and thematic analysis, and an intuitive front-end user interface with built-in work-flow operations such as saving and model visualizations. The system provides effective information retrieval and an integration of a previously fragmented multi-step process into one research platform. The prototype uses surrogate data which is contextually and structurally similar to metadata which would be seen by analysts. With this data, the system was evaluated based on user testing and the determined relevance of the displayed results from a query. The final topic model consists of fifty topics which allow analysts to improve their responses and learn from the existing corpus of RFIs.

Twitter popularity can be used as an efficient source of sentiment data for marketing or social studies. Social studies that can be applied to the process of Twitter analysis is emotion detection. Emotion detection has a potency to be applied in a wide range of applications, ranging from health applications, counseling, business, to community population studies. This research utilizes one of the most popular and simplest topic modeling models, that is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), as well as conversion expression symbol (emoticon/ emoji), which shows the emotion or topic in a tweet to multiply the vocabulary that represents emotion. The advantage of the LDA method proposed is that it can detect some emotions on the tweet because the detection is not rigid and is able to show the proportion of emotion in the tweet. This research compares emotional detection using LDA and conversion expression symbol with emotional detection using LDA without conversion expression symbol. The result shows that emotional detection using LDA with conversion expression symbol is better with the reached average difference of accuracy 14.096%.","","978-1-5386-0903-3","10.1109/ICICOS.2017.8276371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8276371","Latent Dirichlet Allocation;emotion detection;twitter;expression symbolconversion","Testing;Twitter;Training;Resource management;Inference algorithms;Training data;Informatics","emotion recognition;social networking (online)","emotional detection;conversion expression symbol;expression symbol conversion;social studies;tweet emotion detection;Indonesian language;LDA;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;social networks;sentiment data;Twitter analysis;topic modeling;emoticon;emoji","","4","","12","","1 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, current systems often assess only fluency and pronunciation, with limited content-based features being used. This paper examines one particular aspect of content-assessment, off-topic response detection. This is important for deployed systems as it ensures that candidates understood the prompt, and are able to generate an appropriate answer. Previously proposed approaches typically require a set of prompt-response training pairs, which limits flexibility as example responses are required whenever a new test prompt is introduced. Recently, the attention based neural topic model (ATM) was presented, which can assess the relevance of prompt-response pairs regardless of whether the prompt was seen in training. This model uses a bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BiRNN) embedding of the prompt combined with an attention mechanism to attend over the hidden states of a BiRNN embedding of the response to compute a fixed-length embedding used to predict relevance. Unfortunately, performance on prompts not seen in the training data is lower than on seen prompts. Thus, this paper adds the following contributions: several improvements to the ATM are examined; a hierarchical variant of the ATM (HATM) is proposed, which explicitly uses prompt similarity to further improve performance on unseen prompts by interpolating over prompts seen in training data given a prompt of interest via a second attention mechanism; an in-depth analysis of both models is conducted and main failure mode identified. On spontaneous spoken data, taken from BULATS tests, these systems are able to assess relevance to both seen and unseen prompts.","","978-1-5090-4788-8","10.1109/ASRU.2017.8268963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8268963","Spoken Language Assessment;Relevance Assessment;Deep Learning","Training;Training data;Business;Analytical models;Data models;Robustness;Computational modeling","learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;speech recognition","ATM;hierarchical variant;training data;attention mechanism;spontaneous spoken data;hierarchical attention;off-topic spontaneous spoken response detection;automatic spoken language assessment;pronunciation;content-assessment;off-topic response detection;prompt-response training pairs;neural topic model;prompt-response pairs;BiRNN embedding;bidirectional recurrent neural network embedding","","","","23","","25 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is basically for acceptance of e-commerce on social networks. This lead to failure of current recommendation systems to recommend items to users who sign in using social media account on e-commerce website. This problem commonly known as cross website cold start product recommendation. In cold start situation either product or user is new and recommendation system don't have any previous information about them and hence fails to recommendation of items. Our system addresses this issue using microblogging reviews of items collected from social media platform, Twitter. Both audio or video reviews and text reviews in English and Hindi languages are considered in recommendation. Speech to text processing is done on audio or video reviews to get sentimental classification. Cross Lingual Sentiment/Topic Model is used to carry out sentimental classification of Hindi languages reviews. Mapping of product's features and user's features is done with the matrix factorization method. Our experimental results on dataset prepared from microblogging platform Twitter and e-commerce website Amazon demonstrate that our model significantly improve the accuracy of recommendation system in cold start situation.","","978-1-5386-4008-1","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2017.8463697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8463697","Collaborative filtering;Cross lingual sentiment;E-commerce;Recommendation systems;Social networking;Speech recognition","Feature extraction;Recommender systems;Video reviews;Twitter;Collaboration;Business","electronic commerce;matrix decomposition;pattern classification;recommender systems;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","microblogging reviews;cross-lingual sentimental classification;websites;social networks;cross website cold start product recommendation;cold start situation;recommendation system;social media platform;text reviews;Hindi languages reviews;microblogging platform Twitter;e-commerce website Amazon;recommendation systems;audio reviews;Cross Lingual Sentiment Model;Cross Lingual Topic Model","","1","","14","","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The models provide technical recommendation for software developers to make decisions during software maintenance a software evolution. One of the recommendations is user review categorization. There are many categorizations have been popularly used, namely bug errors, feature requests, and noninformative. There are many methods that have been done to classify user reviews. One of the classification methods is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). LDA is a topic modelling method which ables to map hidden topics resided in a document. Thus, one of techniques to map hidden topics into categories is calculating term similarity value between hidden topic and the pre-defined signifier term list. However, the limited signifier term list of each category becomes a problem. Meanwhile Term Frequency-Inverse Corpus Frequency (TF-ICF) is able to take important terms on a cluster. Therefore, this paper introduces a method that combines TF-ICF with LDA clustering based on similarity (LDAS TF-ICF) to overcome it. The classification results were calculated by using precision, recall, and F1-score. The results show the method can outperform LDA. The best performance of LDAS TF-ICF occured when 75% expanded term list was used, given the precision, recall, dan f-measure values 0.564, 0.507, and 0.491, respectively.","","978-1-5386-4739-4","10.1109/ICITEED.2018.8534785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8534785","LDA;Review Semantic Similarity;Software Evolution;Software Maintenance;TF-ICF","Computer bugs;Labeling;Software;Information technology;Electrical engineering;Resource management;Mathematical model","data mining;mobile computing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;software maintenance","map hidden topics;calculating term similarity value;hidden topic;pre-defined signifier term list;LDAS TF-ICF;mobile app review labeling;user review mining;innovative models;technical recommendation;software developers;software maintenance;software evolution;user review categorization;classification methods;topic modelling method;term frequency-inverse cluster frequency;term frequency-inverse corpus frequency","","3","","16","","15 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To alleviate the time-consuming Gibbs sampler adopted by traditional topic models in the testing stage, we construct a Weibull-based variational inference network (encoder) to directly map the observations to their latent representations, and further combine it with the mPGBN (decoder), resulting in a novel multimodal Weibull variational autoencoder (MWVAE), which is fast in out-of-sample prediction and can handle large-scale multimodal datasets. Qualitative evaluations on bimodal data consisting of image-text pairs show that the developed MWVAE can successfully extract expressive multimodal latent representations for downstream tasks like missing modality imputation and multimodal retrieval.

Many recent works show that the probabilistic topic models which are capable of mining latent semantics of images can be effectively applied to HRRS scene classification. However, the existing approaches based on topic models simply utilize low-level hand-crafted features to form semantic features, which severely limit the representative capability of the semantic features derived from topic models. To alleviate this problem, this paper propose to build powerful semantic features using the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) model, by employing the pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as feature extractors rather than relying on the hand-crafted features. Specifically, we develop two methods to generate semantic features, called multi-scale deep semantic representation (MSDS) and multi-level deep semantic representation (MLDS), by extracting CNN features from different layers: (1) in MSDS, the final semantic features are learned by the pLSA with multi-scale features extracted from the convolutional layer of a pre-trained CNN; (2) in MLDS, we extract CNN features for densely sampled image patches at different size level from the fully-connected layer of a pre-trained CNN, and concatenate the sematic features learned by the pLSA at each level. We comprehensively evaluate the two methods on two public HRRS scene datasets, and achieve significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art. The outstanding results demonstrate that the pLSA model is capable of discovering considerably discriminative semantic features from the deep CNN features.","2332-7790","","10.1109/TBDATA.2019.2916880","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017M622519); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771350,41820104006,61871299); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8713925","CNN;scene classification;semantic representation;pLSA;convolutional layer;fully-connected layer","Feature extraction;Semantics;Remote sensing;Visualization;Task analysis;Image representation;Big Data","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing","high-resolution remote sensing imagery;mining deep semantic representations;deep CNN features;discriminative semantic features;pLSA model;public HRRS scene datasets;sematic features;multiscale features;feature extractors;pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks;probabilistic latent semantic analysis model;low-level hand-crafted features;HRRS scene classification;probabilistic topic models;high-resolution remote sensing images","","12","","72","IEEE","14 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the modern rapidity of scientific progress, some turn to automated hypothesis generation (HG) systems to aid this process. These systems can identify implicit or overlooked connections within a large scientific corpus, and while their importance grows alongside the pace of science, they lack thorough validation. Without any standard numerical evaluation method, many validate general-purpose HG systems by rediscovering a handful of historical findings, and some wishing to be more thorough may run laboratory experiments based on automatic suggestions. These methods are expensive, time consuming, and cannot scale. Thus, we present a numerical evaluation framework for the purpose of validating HG systems that leverages thousands of validation hypotheses. This method evaluates a HG system by its ability to rank hypotheses by plausibility; a process reminiscent of human candidate selection. Because HG systems do not produce a ranking criteria, specifically those that produce topic models, we additionally present novel metrics to quantify the plausibility of hypotheses given topic model system output. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed validation method aligns with real-world research goals by deploying our method within MOLIERE, our recent topic-driven HG system, in order to automatically generate a set of candidate genes related to HIV-associated neurodegenerative disease (HAND).

The deep learning methods for objects discovery are based on sacrificing computational complexity to achieve precision, and the training time can be long without GPU platforms, whereas the conventional methods usually lack detection accuracy. To effectively address the problems of the training complexity and the detection speed, we present a new objects discovery approach by proposing a two-stage (training and verification) method. In the training stage, a topic model with words co-occurrence prior is proposed on the basis of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, in which the co-occurrence information among the features is sufficiently utilized. In the verification stage, we propose an anchor-box polishing algorithm that fine-tunes the detection results corresponding to the pre-trained topic model from some conventional algorithms with fast detection time. The experiments on various datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve the detection performance in terms of efficiency and computing costs. It is also robust to objects different in colors, lightings, scales, and so on. Interestingly, the proposed method can be combined with many fast but inaccurate detection algorithms, in which it enhances the model's flexibility.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2019.2894363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8624610","LDA;word co-occurrence prior;object discovery;machine learning;pattern recognition;region of interest","Training;Visualization;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis","computational complexity;convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;object detection","Latent Dirichlet Allocation model;co-occurrence information;anchor-box polishing algorithm;deep learning methods;convolutional neural network;region proposals;machine learning methods;low-rank matrix factorization;image processing;computational complexity;objects discovery approach;words co-occurrence prior;topic model;co-occurrence word model;objects discovery approaches","","1","","58","IEEE","23 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A topic model-based TCP is one of the promising methods, which expresses test cases by topic vectors and prioritizes them in the order such that the set of already-prioritized test cases have the maximum dispersion in the vector space. However, the topic model is not the only option available for vectorizing test cases. Moreover, the distance metric in the vector space and the scheme to prioritize test cases (the way to find the test case that is the farthest from the set of already-prioritized ones) also have some available options. Because the combinations of the above options have not been well-discussed in the past, this paper conducts a comparative study of 36 TCP methods, which are the combinations of (1) three vectorization methods, (2) three distance metrics, and (3) four prioritization schemes (36=3x3x4). The empirical results show the following findings. The choice of the vectorization method has a significant impact on the testing efficiency: a promising option is Doc2Vec (PVDBoW). The combination with the distance metric may also be impactful: a useful combination is Doc2Vec (PV-DBoW) and Euclidean distance.

We propose a novel online multimodal multiexpert learning algorithm for social event tracking. Compared with existing methods, the proposed model has several advantages: First, it has a nonparametric online multimodal tracking module, which is able to not only automatically learn the number of topics from data over time, but also exploit the multimodal property of the social event. Second, it adopts a novel multiexpert minimization restoration scheme and allows the tracked model to evolve backwards to undo undesirable model updates, which helps alleviate the model drift problem of social event tracking. Third, it is able to not only effectively track the multimodal social event, but also automatically exploit the topic evolution of the social event for a deep understanding with multimodal topics. To evaluate the proposed model, we collect a real-world dataset for research on social event tracking with multimodality information.

Few other studies took several steps ahead by attempting to automatically interpret sentiment variations. Learning reasons from sentiment variations is indeed valuable, to either take necessary actions in a timely manner or learn lessons from archived data. However, machines are still immature to carry out the full Sentiment Variations’ Reasoning task perfectly due to various technical hurdles. This paper attempts to explore main approaches to Opinion Reason Mining, with focus on Interpreting Sentiment Variations.

In this paper, we propose a new neural network architecture exploiting both the syntactic information of a sentence and topic distribution of a document. The proposed architecture first constructs a tree-structured long short-term memory (Tree-LSTM) network based on the sentence syntactic dependency tree to obtain a sentence vector representation. For a multi-sentence document, we then use a Chain-LSTM network to obtain the document representation from its sentences’ hidden states. Furthermore, we design a topic-based attention mechanism with two attention levels. The word-level attention is used for weighting words of a single-sentence document and the sentence-level attention for weighting sentences of a multi-sentence document.

We put forward a topic extraction and clustering model based on word2vec to infer key topics, which can be widely used in different fields of research. We find that the growth of human interactive behavior is in an uptrend on the whole. Besides, the cooperative relationship between authors and countries/regions is closer over time. We also make the mensurable evolution analysis of topics by a statistical method. Some topics are hot all the time, while some are unpopular as time goes by.

The online connectivity of devices through social media is one example of Internet of Things (IoT) in which a two-way communication between societies and officials, could be created. Therefore, it is possible to monitor people’s behavior through OSNs, especially during pandemics, to prevent potential social and psychological instabilities that might lead to undesired consequences. This is particularly crucial for governmental and non-governmental organizations to ensure the stability and well-being in societies. In response, we propose a pandemic-friendly real-time framework for monitoring cyber social behavior by utilizing unsupervised and supervised learning approaches. Two BERT-based supervised classifiers are trained and constructed to analyze two types of online social behaviors, hate and sentiment. Unsupervised framework is proposed for OSNs data exploration and coherent interpretation that is used as a complementary tool to facilitate the analysis of online social behaviors during pandemics. Extensive experimentation and evaluation have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed work. Our results have shown superior performance of our BERT-based models in two classification tasks: 1) binary classification for hate behavior detection and 2) multi-class classification for sentiment behavior detection. In addition to our experimentation results, our large-scale analysis of COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the capability of our unsupervised framework for concerns and trends discoveries using OSNs data, along with reliability in automatically and dynamically providing phrase-based interpenetration of the inferred trends and concerns.

Prior work has shown that there is a language of systems thinking and that its presence can be quantified within text using supervised learning methods. Building on this foundation, we present a human-in-the-loop methodology that utilizes topic models to facilitate the identification of systems thinking within a corpus of documents. Though explorative, it requires no manual grading of documents, which makes it significantly faster than previous methods. The methodology uses each document's topic proportion within a systems thinking topic as a proxy measure for the potential of strong systems thinking. The novel aspect of the methodology is in the seeding of the corpus; the user encourages the emergence of the systems thinking topic by adding several documents that demonstrate strong systems thinking to the corpus. Additionally, seeding could be used with concepts other than systems thinking.

However, the existing music generation methods tend to utilize music data inherently and hardly consider music generation from the perspective of music composition theory. Therefore, how to use music theory to guide the automatic generation of music is drawing increasing attention to this area. In this work, we aim to extract music rules from given corpora and then apply them to generate new music of a similar style. We divided the melody into different scales (music segments with different numbers of notes, not set of notes ordered by pitch) based on the music structures and then employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to learn the structural constraints of the provided musical form. The multi-scale fusion of musical features through reinforcement learning (RL) enables the model to consider the music generation from the global scope. Our experimental results show that our model is superior to the baseline model according to objective and subjective rating. The music generated from our model has better consistency in terms of music style, which indicates that the extracted structural features and the multi-scale modeling are promising for music generation of a certain style or topic.","","978-1-6654-3678-6","10.1109/RCAR52367.2021.9517538","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFC2004100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:NSFCU1736202,NSFC61771461); Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20170413161611534); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B090915002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9517538","","Computational modeling;Conferences;Music;Reinforcement learning;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Resource management","data mining;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);music;sensor fusion;text analysis","topic based music generation;automatic music generation;music data;music composition theory;latent dirichlet allocation topic model;musical features;music style;music rules extraction;multiscale fusion;reinforcement learning;RE-RLTuner;data mining","","","","16","","31 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Interesting results were achieved when three large databases tested the model, namely: Database of European Laws (period 1952 to 1990), Database of Audit reports issued by the State General Secretariat of Management of Pernambuco (period 2010 to 2019), and Database of Appellate Decisions issued by the Brazilian Federal Accountability Office (year of 2019). We compared the performance of three machine learning methods: K-means, LSA and LDA. In our experiments, we observed that (i) pre-processing techniques have a marked influence on the result of topic extraction; that (ii) Silhouette techniques and topic coherence produced the best value for the quantitative topics in all databases ; that LSA associated with LDA presented the best performance in all three databases, regarding the identification of relevant themes (topics) identified.

More specifically, we examine the practical effects of several classes of Dirichlet priors on 2000 LDA models created from abstract and full-text research articles. Our results show that symmetrical or asymmetrical priors on the document-topic distribution or the topic-word distribution for full-text data have little effect on topic coherence scores and human topic ranking. In contrast, asymmetrical priors on the document-topic distribution for abstract data show a significant increase in topic coherence scores and improved human topic ranking compared to a symmetrical prior.

Topics are basic components that are often used to analyze data in the textual forms, such as the news article. By using topic modeling, topics can be detected automatically on large news documents which are difficult to perform manually. One of the topic modeling that can be used is the clustering-based method, i.e., Eigenspace-based Fuzzy C-Means (EFCM). The common initialization method of EFCM is random. However, this random initialization usually produces different topics for each run. Therefore, we consider Non-Negative Double Singular Value Decomposition (NNDSVD) as an initialization method of EFCM. Besides the advantage of non-randomness, our simulations show that the NNDSVD method gives better accuracies in term of interpretability score than the random method.","","978-1-5386-4572-7","10.1109/ICoICT.2018.8528791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8528791","topic detection;fuzzy c-means;eigenspace;initialization","Clustering algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Singular value decomposition;Portals;Clustering methods;Data models;Coherence","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;singular value decomposition;text analysis","random initialization;nonrandomness;NNDSVD method;random method;indonesian online news topic detection;news analysis;textual forms;news article;topic modeling;news documents;clustering-based method;nonnegative double singular value decomposition initialization method;Eigenspace-based fuzzy c-means algorithm","","","","13","","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the diversity of licenses makes it difficult for developers to correctly understand the license content and has aggravated the chance of illegally combining open source components. To alleviate this problem, existing methods mainly analyse license text manually. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the automatic identification of open source software license terms. This method consists of three key components, license modeling for license terms extraction, topic model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation to mine topics in licenses, and topics and terms mapping module for construction of their relationships. To evaluate the effectiveness and practicability of our model, we build a new Open Source License Dataset for model training and testing.

However, it is challenging to choose the threshold since the choice needs to consider both the similarities of the topics and the length of documents. This paper describes a new intuitive method to detect anomalies which simply manipulates the output of the trained model. Such an approach is anticipated to have parameters that are more intuitive to define for a given problem. To assess the utility of the proposed approach, we also present a use case involving identifying ships misreporting their ship-type using geo-location data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages.

Many portals such as ProgrammableWeb and BioCatalogue allow users to create manual tags annotating Web services and their compositions (e.g., mashups). This is extremely helpful for managing and retrieving enormous Web service data. In the past few years, many tag recommendation approaches have been proposed for Web services that contain few or no tags. Most of them only exploit the textual content or tag service matrix information. Sometimes those approaches suffer from the data sparsity problem, especially when Web services have only few tags or their auxiliary textual contents are hard to be obtained. In real world, a plenty of relationships are available in recommendation systems, e.g., the composition relationship between services and the annotation relationship between mashups and tags. These multi-relational data can be utilized as additional features to improve the recommendation performance. In this paper, we exploit various types of relationships as features and propose a novel topic-sensitive approach based on the Factorization Machines for mashup tag recommendation. Factorization Machines is utilized to model the pair-wise interactions between all features and predict adequate tags for mashups. In this approach, we first obtain the latent topics of all tags as well as the description documents for mashups and APIs based on a novel probabilistic topic model. Then, a multi-relational network by mining various relationships from the Web service data is constructed. Various auxiliary informations are subsequently extracted from the network to train the Factorization Machines.

Identifying customer-related events is an important task in customer services which is possible from the call transcripts. However, call centers produces a vast amount of transcripts which makes the manual or semi-manual processing of such raw datasets quite challenging. Furthermore, customer-agent call transcripts tend not to explicitly denote events that might be beneficial to customer services. Albeit being highly researched across multiple domains in the literature, event detection, especially implicit life event detection have not been well examined from call transcripts due to a lack of proper large-scale dataset. In this research, we propose a novel deep learning approach based on latent topic modeling and deep recurrent neural networks with memory units to automatically detect implicit events from a customer's history of call transcripts. These implicit events are detected prior to the report date of that event thereby not containing any explicit topic/feature. We provide a case study on a real-life, large-scale data of more than 800K call transcripts from a large financial services company in the U.S. to examine the practical features and challenges of this problem. The evaluation results demonstrate the potential applicability of our implicit life event detection as it achieves a macro-recall score of 53 (macro-f1 of 47.5) on a highly imbalanced test set, negative samples are 95% of the data. Our model beats the the state-of-the-art text classification benchmarks by macro-f1 score of 5.6 and macro-recall of 8.8 on average, and performs better than the ensemble of all single-document and sequential classification benchmarks albeit being significantly less complex.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to extract common topics and students' common impressions against them from students' journals. Weekly keywords are discovered from journals by scoring noun words with a measure based on TF-IDF term weighting scheme, and then we analyze co-occurrence relationships between extracted keywords and adjectives. We employs nonnegative matrix factorization, one of the topic modeling techniques, to discover the hidden impression topics from the co-occurrence relationships. As a case study, we applied our method on students' journals of the course ""Information Science"" held in our university.

However, human observers are often limited in their ability to process simultaneous information sources. Recent advancements in computer vision, driven by deep learning methods, have enabled general object recognition, unlocking opportunities for camera-based sensing beyond the existing human observer paradigm. In this paper, we present a Natural Language Pro-cessing-inspired approach, entitled Bag-of-Label-Words (BoLW), for analyzing image data sets using exclusively textual labels. The BoLW model represents the data in a conventional matrix form, enabling data compression and decomposition techniques, while preserving semantic interpretability. We apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model to decompose the label data into a small number of semantic topics. To illustrate our approach, we use freeway camera images collected from the Boston area between December 2017-January 2018. We analyze the cameras' sensitivity to weather events; identify temporal traffic patterns; and analyze the impact of infrequent events, such as the winter holidays and the “bomb cyclone” winter storm. This study demonstrates the flexibility of our approach, which allows us to analyze weather events and freeway traffic using only traffic camera image labels.","2153-0017","978-1-7281-0323-5","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569449","","Cameras;Vocabulary;Roads;Sensors;Observers;Data models;Traffic control","cameras;computational linguistics;data compression;image sensors;matrix algebra;natural language processing;object recognition;road traffic;text analysis;traffic engineering computing","deep learning methods;image data sets;BoLW model;conventional matrix form;data compression;decomposition techniques;semantic interpretability;freeway camera images;weather events;temporal traffic patterns;freeway traffic;traffic camera image labels;semantic topic analysis;traffic camera images;road infrastructure networks;operators visual information;critical points;human observers;computer vision;object recognition;camera-based sensing;bag-of-label-words;textual labels;latent dirichlet allocation topic model;information sources;natural language pro-cessing-inspired approach","","1","","20","","9 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, we propose an adaptive semi-supervised semantic similarity calculation method that combines the learning content of the supervised model Siamese LSTM with the topic information of the unsupervised LDA topic model through an attention layer. Inspired by active learning, we apply an adaptive mechanism to actively optimize model parameters. We apply this method to standard semantic datasets for ablation experiments.

In this approach, the latent topics discovered by topic modeling are treated as the clinical goals, so that each patient trace is converted to a topic-based sequence. Process mining is used to generate a concise process model on these sequences. However, there is a common problem about the topic modeling that the redundancy between different topics is considerable. It means that some clinical activities strongly correlate to many topics, which has a significant impact on the ability of representing clinical goals of the topics.

This paper moves one step further, by studying latent topic models over service collaboration history. A concept of service co-occurrence topic is coined, equipped with a mechanism developed to construct service co-occurrence documents. The key idea is to treat each service as a document and its co-occurring services as the bag of words in that document. Four gauges are constructed to measure self-co-occurrence of a specific service. A theoretical approach, Service Co-occurrence LDA (SeCo-LDA), is developed to extract latent service co-occurrence topics, including representative services and words, temporal strength, and services' impact on topics. Such derived knowledge of topics will help to reveal the trend of service composition, understand collaboration behaviors among services and lead to better service recommendation. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, experiments on a real-world data set were conducted. Compared with methods of Apriori, content matching based on service description, and LDA using mashup-service usage records, our experiments show that SeCo-LDA can recommend service composition more effectively, i.e., 5% better in terms of Mean Average Precision than baselines.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2018.2821149","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61673230); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328903","Topic model;service co-occurrence LDA;automatic service composition;service composition recommendation","Mashups;Biological system modeling;Ecosystems;Computational modeling;Market research;Probabilistic logic;Semantics","data mining;groupware;recommender systems","SeCo-LDA;composition recommendation;service composition;service recommendation;mashup-service usage records;service collaboration history;co-occurrence topic;co-occurrence documents;service co-occurrence topics mining","","12","","40","IEEE","30 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, discovering knowledge from the big medical data can be very complex because of the nature of this type of data: they normally contain large amount of unstructured data; they may have lots of missing values; they can be highly complex and heterogeneous. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning approach. In particular, we estimate missing values based on patients' similarity, i.e., we predict one patient's missing features based on the values of similar patients. This is implemented with the Collaborative Topic Regression method, which tightly couples topic model and probability matrix factorization and is able to utilize the rich information hidden in the data. Then a deep neural network-based method is applied for the prediction of health risks. This method can help us handle complex and multi-modality data.

In this paper we propose a novel optimization algorithm for NMF under probability constraints, thereby achieving better performance in terms of accuracy without losing efficiency. More precisely, our theoretical analysis of our algorithm shows that: (1) our method monotonically decreases the objective function; (2) the output matrices satisfy the probability constraint; (3) its learning rate is the largest while among satisfying (1) and (2); and (4) the computational time complexity remains the same as the existing optimization method.

Although the spatial configuration of road networks contributes to urban function delineation at the block level, the morphological uncertainties caused by the road network structure in fine-scale urban function retrieval are ignored. This paper proposes an adaptive network-constrained clustering (ANCC) model to map urban function distributions at a finer level. By utilizing points of interest (POIs) to indicate independent functional places, the adaptive road configuration with a multilevel bandwidth selection strategy is proposed. On this basis, a term frequency-inverse document frequency-weighted latent Dirichlet allocation (TW-LDA) topic model is designed to delineate urban functions from semantic information. Taking Futian District, Shenzhen, as a case study, the results show an overall accuracy of approximately 77.10% in urban function mapping. A comparison of a block-level mapping model, a non-adaptive network-based model and the ANCC model reveals accuracies of 53.10%, 59.20% and 77.10%, respectively, indicating the advantages of the ANCC model for improving urban function mapping accuracy.

However, these quality topic vectors are hard to be obtained due to the lack of abundant textual information in Web service description documents. In practice, prior knowledge from human's trajectory of utilizing Web services could be helpful in improving the accuracy of Web services clustering. With an analysis in the dataset of Web services and Mashups from ProgrammableWeb, we observe that Web services Mashuped together are highly likely to belong to different clusters and Web services being annotated with identical tags tend to be within the same cluster. Based on these observations, this paper proposes an efficient clustering approach for Web services. The approach firstly uses a probabilistic topic model to elicit the latent topic vectors from Web service description documents. It then performs clustering based on the K-means++ algorithm by incorporating parameters representing above mentioned prior knowledge. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted to validate the performance of our proposed approach based on a ground truth dataset crawled from ProgrammableWeb.

However, many existing sentiment lexicons are constructed ignoring the variability of the sentiment polarities of words in different topics or domains. In this paper, we address this issue by assigning multiple pairs of topics and sentiments for each word. In TaSL, documents are represented by multiple pairs of topics and sentiments and words are characterized by a multinomial distribution over the pairs of topics and sentiments. The main advantage of TaSL is that the sentiment polarities of words in different topics can be sufficiently captured. This model is beneficial to construct a topic-specific sentiment lexicon and then effectively improve the performance of sentiment classification.

We propose a new approach for semantically clustering of text documents based on cognitive science and graph theory. We apply a computational cognitive model of semantic association for human semantic memory, known as Incremental Construction of an Associative Network (ICAN). The vector-based model of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), has been a leading computational cognitive model for semantic learning and topic modeling, but it has well-known limitations including not considering the original word-order and doing semantic reduction with neither a linguistic nor cognitive basis. These issues have been overcome by the ICAN model. ICAN model is used to generate document-level semantic-graphs. Cognitive and graph-based topic and context identification methods are used for semantic reduction of ICAN graphs. A corpus-graph is generated from ICAN graphs, and then a community-detection graph algorithm is applied for the final step of document clustering. Experiments are conducted on three commonly used datasets. Using the purity and entropy criteria for clustering quality, our results show a notable outperformance over the LSA-based approach.","","978-1-5386-4408-9","10.1109/ICSC.2018.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8334465","document clustering;semantic learning;semantic representation;cognitive semantics","Semantics;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Matrix decomposition;Context modeling;Clustering algorithms;Linguistics","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;text analysis","semantic-based text document clustering;cognitive semantic learning;semantic reduction;community-detection graph algorithm;corpus-graph;ICAN graphs;context identification methods;document-level semantic-graphs;ICAN model;original word-order;topic modeling;leading computational cognitive model;Latent Semantic Analysis;Associative Network;human semantic memory;semantic association;cognitive science;graph theory","","7","","34","","12 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, most traditional collaborative filtering algorithms only consider the user's rating of the item, which greatly limits the accuracy of the recommendation. This paper takes movie recommendation as the research object, and proposes a collaborative filtering recommendation model based on LDA topic model and network embedding, which improves the dependability of the model. The model first uses the LDA topic model to extract the text features of users and movies from texts, then builds the association network through the association features between users, and learns the network features using node2vec and GraphGAN. Finally, the two parts are combined to compute the similarity between users to recommend movies using the collaborative filtering algorithm. Results of the experiment on the real dataset of the Douban website demonstrate that movie recommendation with the user characteristics mined by the LDA model and GraphGAN combined can achieve the best effect, which is much higher than the collaborative filtering based on user ratings or using only LDA theme. This proves that network embedding can promote the accuracy of recommendationation, while ensuring the dependability of the model. The method proposed in this paper is effective.","","978-1-7281-6057-3","10.1109/DSA.2019.00043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9045852","movie recommendation;collaborative filtering;LDA;node2vec;GraphGAN","Machine learning algorithms;Collaborative filtering;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Filtering algorithms;Feature extraction;Motion pictures","collaborative filtering;neural nets;recommender systems","LDA model;network embedding-based collaborative filtering recommendation;recommender system domain;collaborative filtering algorithm;cold-start problems;movie recommendation;LDA topic model;text features;association network;association features;network features;user characteristics;user ratings;GraphGAN;node2vec","","1","","26","","26 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The creation of predictive models heavily relies on structured data. It is not well understood the benefit of adding free-text features in improving risk prediction. Objectives: We aimed to predict the 30-day and 3-year rehospitalization risk among patients with severe mental diseases and to compare predictive performances of using structured data alone, unstructured data alone, and combined structured and unstructured data. Methods: Veterans with ≥2 diagnoses of serious mental diseases including schizophrenia (SZ), schizoaffective disorder (SAD), bipolar disorder (BP), and major depressive disorder (MDD) were sampled from the Veteran Healthcare Administration (VHA) databases. Topic modeling methods were used to process unstructured data to identify stable topics. Correlation tests and automatic stepwise models were used to select features. Results: Among 139,830 patients with severe mental disease, 76.2% diagnosed with MDD, 23.4% for BP, 8.3% for SZ, and 3.5% for SAD. Regardless of 30-day and 3-year rehospitalization outcomes, patients with following characteristics were at higher risk of hospitalization: male, homeless, having a condition of SAD, primarily diagnosed with and treated for alcohol withdrawal, and diagnosed with cocaine abuse. Besides, patients who had topics related to homeless, suicide, and substance abuse were also at higher risk. In all models, the prediction accuracy based on the individual level measured by c-statistic estimate was in the range of 0.6-0.7 regardless of features only from structured data, only from unstructured data, or from both and unstructured data. Conclusion: Topics identified from the unstructured data made contribution to predicting short-term and long-term rehospitalization. Their importance was as good as the features identified from the structured data such as demographics, ICDs, CPTs, and medications.","","978-1-6654-4231-2","10.1109/ICECET52533.2021.9698504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9698504","severe mental diseases;rehospitalization;prediction;topic modeling","Correlation;Databases;Computational modeling;Medical services;Predictive models;Depression;Data models","diseases;feature selection;health care;medical computing;medical disorders;medical information systems;psychology;statistical analysis;text analysis","rehospitalization prediction;severe mental illness;clinical risk prediction;predictive models;structured data;unstructured data;bipolar disorder;free-text based features;schizophrenia;schizoaffective disorder;major depressive disorder;Veteran Healthcare Administration databases;correlation tests;automatic stepwise models;feature selection;c-statistic estimate;short-term rehospitalization;long-term rehospitalization;alcohol withdrawal;cocaine abuse;time 30 day;time 3 year","","","","27","IEEE","11 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among many forms of social media, Twitter is one of the most crucial online places for political debate. Most of the previous studies focus on the formal structure of the Twitter political field, such as its homophilic tendency, or otherwise limit the analysis to a few topics. In order to explore whether Twitter functions as an echo chamber in general, however, we have to investigate not only the structure but also the contents of Twitter's political field. Accordingly, we conducted both large-scale social network analysis and natural language processing. We firstly applied a community detection method to the reciprocal following network in Twitter and found five politically distinct communities in the field. We further examined dominant topics discussed therein by employing a topic model in analyzing the content of the tweets, and we found that a topic related to xenophobia is circulated solely in right-wing communities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to address echo chambers in Japanese Twitter political field and to examine the formal structure and the contents of tweets with the combination of large-scale social network analysis and natural language processing.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8258291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8258291","political polarization;Twitter;public sphere;echo chambers;topic modeling;network analysis","Twitter;Speech;Internet;Facebook;Sociology;Statistics","ergonomics;Internet;natural language processing;politics;social networking (online)","natural language processing;political polarization;social media;political debate;large-scale social network analysis;politically distinct communities;Japanese Twitter political field;tweet formal structure;homophilic tendency;xenophobia;right-wing communities","","5","","25","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The data can be well utilized if it is properly classified and could be categorized to have separate study on each category of data. In the era of technology, computer science, and mathematics is continuously working to resolve problems like these. With a huge amount of data being available it is not an easy task to analyze the data. A number of studies have been conducted to extract features from the data. Text Mining, a sub-field of machine learning that deals with such unauthorized and unorganized text to get meaningful data that can be analyzed and used. It is intensely being used to analyze the unstructured text, get structured features from the text and to find patterns. So, unsupervised learning is aiding the supervised algorithms to work on such kind of text. One of the growing text mining algorithms is the topic modeling, which distributes the documents into topics and topics into words. This algorithm is working better than other algorithms like tf-idfasit considers the actual scenario where the topic can be related to multiple words, so LDA is working closer to the real-world topics and its distributions.","","978-1-6654-3521-5","10.1109/ICSES52305.2021.9633830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9633830","LDA;Topic modeling;Classification;Clustering;Text Mining;Unsupervised learning","Text mining;Machine learning algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Mathematics;Classification algorithms","","","","","","10","IEEE","16 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These societal benefits can only occur, however, if sufficient trust is established between rideshare partners. Trust judgments heavily influence the usage of ridesharing platforms. Towards trust building, ridesharing systems are starting to allow drivers to provide personal information about themselves. Some previous work already built a trust prediction model using information from Instagram profiles. Their results indicated both social account information and picture information factors influenced judgments of trust of potential rideshare partners. In this paper, we advance these findings by describing a co-training approach that uses social account information and picture information as two independent views to predict trust judgments. Specifically, this analysis addresses the problem of accurate labeling of complex pictures from social media by using the hashtags of pictures for trust inference. We use a topic model to summarize the hashtags of pictures into a small number of groups called topics. The final results show that using hashtags as picture information yields a better result than the use of picture category. The co-training approach with social account information and hashtags outperforms supervised and semisupervised classifiers. Often, in order to make an accurate trust prediction model, large amounts of expensive labeled training data are needed. The co-training approach described allows for faster labeling of large datasets, saving resources by avoiding intensive human labeling effort.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9005620","Ridesharing;Social Network;Instagram;Trust Prediction;Co-Training;Topic Model","Data security;Social networking (online);Instagram","security of data;social networking (online);traffic engineering computing;trusted computing","trust inference;social media data;trust judgments;ridesharing platforms;ridesharing systems;personal information;social account information;picture information factors;co-training approach;hashtags;picture category;trust prediction model","","1","","18","","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some user interviews have been done in the past to understand the security and privacy concerns of end users on IoT devices, but they were limited in the number of participants. To better understand user opinions on IoT security and privacy, we conducted a larger user study using Twitter and Reddit data. We collected more than 6 million tweets and reddit submissions using query search keywords such as drone security, smart camera privacy and etc and labeled them using flair pre-trained en-sentiment model. We performed sentiment analysis using BERT, a transformer-based model, and a neural network classifier. Our sentiment analysis results have shown that Twitter users are more positive towards IoT security and privacy, whereas Reddit users are more negative. On certain categories such as smart refrigerator, smart TV, drone, speaker, voice assistant, fitness tracker, and smartwatch, both users express negative sentiment. We also conducted a longitudinal study to understand how user opinions change over time. A continuous upward trend has been identified for both positive and negative sentiments on Reddit users. We further analyzed users’ specific concerns through topic modeling particularly related to smart lock, smart camera, and drone.","2693-8340","978-1-6654-1252-0","10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9556306","Sentiment Analysis;BERT;IoT Security;IoT Privacy;Topic Modeling;Twitter;Reddit;Social Media","Privacy;Analytical models;Sentiment analysis;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Blogs;Smart cameras","data mining;data privacy;Internet of Things;social networking (online)","IoT security;Reddit users;negative sentiment;positive sentiments;negative sentiments;mining social media;understand user opinions;user interviews;end users;IoT devices;larger user study;drone security;smart camera privacy;flair pre-trained en-sentiment model;sentiment analysis results;Twitter users","","","","23","","8 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two approaches have been used to assess the authenticity of the news using web-scrapped data. In the first approach the data is the pre-processed using NLP techniques like extraction of raw text, the removal of special-characters, white-spaces, and stop words. This is followed by lemmatization which groups words with similar meanings. After Lemmatization we apply, Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Vectorization to form a corpus which is further used to train the models. We propose the use of cosine similarity score, obtained after performing topic modelling along with the corpus to improve the classification accuracies. The classifiers are KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Passive-aggressive Classifier, and SVM to determine the news is reliable or unreliable. More focus has been given to improve the classification accuracies of the passive aggressive classifier which is the most widely used classifier in fake news detection. In the second approach, we use ensemble learning technique called as stacking along with cosine similarity score to train another model which gives the result as reliable or unreliable. It is observed that the second approach shows good improvement in the accuracy of fake news detection.","","978-1-6654-0430-3","10.1109/ICCICT50803.2021.9510134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9510134","Fake News;Lemmatization;TF-IDF;Cosine Similarity;NLP;Topic Modelling;Stacking","Support vector machines;Computers;Computational modeling;Stacking;Reliability;Data mining;Regression tree analysis","data mining;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;regression analysis;support vector machines;text analysis","passive aggressive classifier;Passive-aggressive Classifier;web-scrapped data;novel hybrid method;cosine similarity score;fake news detection","","","","15","IEEE","12 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, this semantic representation is more expressive than some widely-used text representation models such as the latent topic model. Wherein, the short-text conceptualization algorithm used here is based on a novel co-ranking framework, enabling the signals (i.e., the words and the concepts) to fully interplay to derive the solid conceptualization for the short-texts. Afterwards, we further extend the conceptual short-text embedding models by utilizing an attention-based model that selects the relevant words within the context to make more efficient prediction.

To this end, we propose a model called Micro Aspect Sentiment Model (MicroASM).

With a large number of medical notes collected from hospitals, there is an urgent need for developing effective models for predicting mortality based on them. In contrast to structured electronic health records, medical notes are unstructured texts written by experienced caregivers and contain more complicated information about patients, posing more challenges for modeling. Most previous studies rely on tedious hand-crafted features or generating indirect features based on some statistical models such as topic modeling, which might incur information loss for later model training. Recently, some deep models have been proposed to unify the stages of feature construction and model training. However, domain concept knowledge has been neglected, which is important to gain a better understanding of medical notes. To address the above issues, we propose novel Knowledge-aware Deep Dual Networks (K-DDN) for the text-based mortality prediction task. Specifically, a simple deep dual network is first proposed to fuse the representations of medical knowledge and raw text for prediction. Afterward, we incorporate a co-attention mechanism into the basic model, guiding the knowledge and text representation learning with the help of each other. Experimental results on two publicly real-world datasets show the proposed deep dual networks outperform state-of-the-art methods and the co-attention mechanism can further improve the performance.","2375-026X","978-1-5386-7474-1","10.1109/ICDE.2019.00127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8731459","mortality prediction;deep learning;medical concept","Task analysis;Predictive models;Data mining;Medical diagnostic imaging;Training;Knowledge engineering","data mining;electronic health records;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;neural nets;statistical analysis;text analysis","medical data mining;medical notes;structured electronic health records;unstructured texts;statistical models;topic modeling;model training;deep models;feature construction;domain concept knowledge;text-based mortality prediction task;medical knowledge;raw text;deep dual network;text representation learning;indirect features;knowledge-aware deep dual networks;K-DDN","","2","","45","","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional approaches, however, mostly rely on static and potentially subjectively described texts offered by service providers. In this paper, we propose a novel way of dynamically reconstructing objective service profiles based on mashup descriptions, which carry historical information of how services are used in mashups. Our key idea is to leverage mashup descriptions and structures to discover important word features of services and bridge the vocabulary gap between mashup developers and service providers. Specifically, we jointly model mashup descriptions and component service using author topic model in order to reconstruct service profiles. Exploiting word features derived from the reconstructed service profiles, a new service recommendation algorithm is developed.

Analysis of positive and negative tweets reveals that negative tweets are mostly originated from India and the US. On the contrary, positive tweets belong to Pakistan and Afghanistan. LDA is used for topic modeling on two datasets containing tweets about the current situation after the Taliban take control of Afghanistan. Topics extracted through LDA suggest that majority of the Afghanistan people seem satisfied with the Taliban’s takeover while the topics from negative tweets reveal that issues discussed in negative tweets are related to the US concerns in Afghanistan.

As the library grows, a key operational challenge for PLOS is the matching of a submitted manuscript with one of the nearly 6,000 academic editors with whom they work. We frame this problem as one of reducing distance between editors and documents in a network, where editors and documents are modeled as nodes in a graph connected by shared features. We apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining methods, such as topic modeling and word embedding, to create new nodes and edges in the network to reduce its scale, thus reducing the distance between documents and editors. These new nodes and edges form a rich semantic network that may also be used to represent the thematic content of the corpus as a whole. Our solution iterates on PLOS's current internal tool for editor matching, PLOS Match, by recommending potential editors who have edited semantically similar manuscripts in the past. Improved quality of editor matches will increase the rate at which editors accept an invitation to participate in manuscript evaluation. This will streamline PLOS's internal review process and hence speed knowledge delivery.","","978-1-5386-6343-1","10.1109/SIEDS.2018.8374753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8374753","editor matching;natural language processing;PLOS;text mining;topic modeling;word embedding","Cancer;Semantics;Natural language processing;XML;Tools;Task analysis;Pipelines","data mining;document handling;electronic publishing;natural language processing;semantic networks","editor matching;semantically similar manuscripts;academic journals;rich semantic network development;text mining methods;word embedding;document handling;PLOS current internal tool;public library of science;natural language processing;NLP","","","","16","","7 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Topic modeling was performed on the dialogue transcript between the customers and Customer Service Officers (CSOs) to identify the customers' reason for calling. Using the customer-level profile, transaction and servicing log data, a multi-task neural network was trained to predict if a customer is going to call the bank for any customer service request in the next 10 days. In the IVR system, a personalized voice prompt will recommend relevant digital services based on the model prediction and redirect the customer to digital services through a SMS with a URL to chatbot. Through this, the number of calls reaching the CSOs has reduced and the bank can achieve considerable operational cost savings and provide a more efficient customer service experience.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9206709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9206709","call centre;customer service;topic modeling;neural network;digital transformation;banking","Customer services;Banking;Predictive models;Neural networks;Satellite broadcasting;Companies;Machine learning","bank data processing;banking;call centres;customer services;interactive systems;Internet;neural nets","customer service officers;customer service experience;digital services;personalized voice prompt;customer service request;multitask neural network;customer-level profile;chatbot;interactive voice response system;personalized customer service experience;customer journeys;financial service companies;neural networks;consumer banking call centre;personalized digital customer services","","","","13","","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Business models built using taxonomies have the potential to reduce their efficiency with the arrival of new business ideas and concepts in the market over time. This happens because outdated business taxonomies get insufficient to fully capture the intended meaning of business documents to perform classification. Experts may need time to understand and engineering to place new data into the taxonomy to increase the classification accuracy of business documents. Here, the idea of automatic semantic enrichment of taxonomies came into consideration. This study introduces a taxonomy enrichment approach based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique, i.e. BERTopic, a Neural topic modeling using contextualized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to automatically augment a given business taxonomy with many additional concepts by leveraging a corpus of online news documents. The experiments show that augmenting topics from the text corpus into the taxonomy substantially increases the classification accuracy of business documents.","2768-7295","978-1-6654-9810-4","10.1109/INISTA55318.2022.9894173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9894173","Business;document classification;NLP;topic modeling;transformers","Technological innovation;Taxonomy;Semantics;Text categorization;Organizations;Transformers;Natural language processing","","","","","","27","IEEE","23 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This text is changing and proliferating, making it hard for people to process, read, and remember. Data mining and information extraction algorithms are used to develop new automation techniques to process the unstructured text. Among this publicly available text, there are a considerable amount of online medical articles, which provides valuable information about diseases, symptoms, operations, treatments, drugs, etc. Automatic unstructured text classification offers practical information management that does not depend on the subjective criteria of classification. It also provides useful information by obtaining and correlating relevant data present in documents. It also classifies, identifies and presents all sources of knowledge and reduces the time for retrieving information by simplifying access to content. Therefore, medical information needs to be classified into their respected categories (such as Diabetes, Cancer, Depression, Pediatrics, etc.). In this paper, we propose to use a deep learning approach for unstructured medical text classification at the document level. In our classification model we used two types of features: (i) content-based features (stylistic and complexity), and (ii) health domain-specific features. Moreover, rather than dealing with binary classification, this work handles multiclasses medical articles classification. This classification is done based on linguistic features that are extracted from the text, it also incorporates medical domain-specific terms/keywords as part of the classification feature set. These domain-specific features are extracted by applying topic modeling technique to spot the most probable terms for each medical class. Our experiments shows a reasonable classification accuracy for such a large number of classes.","2161-5330","978-1-7281-5052-9","10.1109/AICCSA47632.2019.9035282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9035282","Machine Learning;Deep Learning;Natural Language Processing;Linguistic Analysis;Medical Text Classification;Topic Modeling","Feature extraction;Medical diagnostic imaging;Deep learning;Linguistics;Analytical models;Data models;Data mining","cancer;data mining;diseases;feature extraction;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical information systems;pattern classification;text analysis","unstructured medical text classification;supervised deep learning approach;publicly available text;online medical articles;automatic unstructured text classification;practical information management;medical information;classification model;binary classification;multiclasses medical articles classification;classification feature;reasonable classification accuracy","","","","47","","16 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Choosing the right customer to approach for cross-purchase opportunities has a direct effect on both decreasing customer churn rate and increasing revenue. Unlike sales data of general products, insurance sales data typically contains only a few products (e.g., private medical insurance, life insurance, etc), it is highly imbalanced with a vast majority of customers with no cross-purchasing information, highly noisy due to varying purchase behaviour between different customers, and has no ground truth for knowing if the majority customers are truly non-cross-sell customers or they are missed opportunities. These data challenges render the building of machine learning models for accurately identifying potential cross-sell customers extremely difficult. This paper proposes a novel approach to solve this challenging problem of cross-sell customer identification using Positive Unlabelled (PU) learning in conjunction with advanced feature engineering on customer demographic data and unstructured customer question-response texts through topic modelling. We implement a bagging approach to iteratively learn the positive samples (the confirmed cross-sells) alongside random sub-samples of the unlabelled set. The proposed approach is extensively evaluated on real insurance data that has been newly collected from a leading insurance company for this study. Evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can successfully identify new potential opportunities for likely cross-sell customers.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-8671-9","10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9892762","positive unlabelled learning;cross-sell;bagging classification;topic modelling;text similarity","Neural networks;Insurance;Companies;Feature extraction;Data models;Real-time systems;Recommender systems","","","","","","32","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To understand community and personal feedback trends, we perform a longitudinal study of 39,249 reviews that contain 248,695 review comments from a proprietary project that is developed by DellEMC. To investigate generalizability, we replicate our study on the OpenStackn Ova project. Through an analysis guided by topic models, we observe that more context-specific, technical feedback is introduced as the studied projects and communities age and as the reviewers within those communities accrue experience. This suggests that communities are reaping a larger return on investment in code review as they grow accustomed to the practice and as reviewers hone their skills. The code review trends uncovered by our models present opportunities for enterprises to monitor reviewing tendencies and improve knowledge transfer and reviewer skills.","","978-1-6654-9590-5","10.1145/3510457.3513039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793920","modern code review;mining software repositories;topic modelling","Analytical models;Codes;Organizations;Market research;Software;Stakeholders;Monitoring","Internet;knowledge management;project management;public domain software;software development management;software engineering;software quality","knowledge transfer;reviewer skills;code reviewing feedback evolve;code changes;248 review comments;695 review comments;code review trends","","","","52","","17 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During maintenance and reuse, reading through the full source code will be quite tough. Many programmers stick to reading and navigating code than they develop it. Most experienced developers reuse existing code functionality. The cost of searching for and integrating reusable code determines the success of source code reuse. One method for identifying source code functionality names is to use a topic model. While numerous studies have focused on using topic models to analyze software systems, none have retrieved topics from actual source code syntax. By considering the optimal number of conditional statements, expressions, arrays, Boolean operators, and other unique programming keywords utilized is critical for any source code functionality name prediction. The dataset for the research model was collected from a variety of software developers' source code throughout the world. In software development, there are many different types of source code repositories, including source code algorithms. These repositories will be unstructured and unusable, requiring a technique to transform them into something useable. The source code data will be decomposed into smaller bits of programming language phrases using the Java parser library. Boosting algorithms are still more advantageous under the regime of limited training data and low knowledge for parameter modification. This study looked at supervised learning boosting algorithms such as XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and AdaBoost.

In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic approach based on hierarchical topic model, in order to formulate the dynamics of users' participation into interaction groups formed by users' interrelationships on a social network. Under the assumption that user's partition into interaction groups corresponds to an equilibrium of the game, each user is represented by a selfish agent that chooses to join or exit a group according to its utility which consists a gain function and a loss one. An agent may belong to more than one interaction group because of its several different interests, which is naturally captured by the proposed approach. We also take into consideration the hierarchy of topics, in order to better describe the characteristic of the groups from different levels. The results of experiments which we conduct on Facebook dataset illustrate that the proposed approach is more effective in identifying interaction groups and is able to distinguish these groups on different topic levels and different scales adaptively.","","978-1-5386-7325-6","10.1109/WI.2018.00-69","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8609614","Interaction Group Identification, Game Theory, Social Network","Games;Internet;Facebook;Sports;Partitioning algorithms;Inference algorithms","game theory;natural language processing;pattern clustering;social networking (online)","hierarchical topic model;topic levels;dynamic interaction group identification;social networking services;game-theoretic approach;gain function;user clustering","","","","22","","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the anti-vax community exhibits a broader range of “flavors” of COVID-19 topics, and hence can appeal to a broader cross-section of individuals seeking COVID-19 guidance online, e.g. individuals wary of a mandatory fast-tracked COVID-19 vaccine or those seeking alternative remedies. Hence the anti-vax community looks better positioned to attract fresh support going forward than the pro-vax community. This is concerning since a widespread lack of adoption of a COVID-19 vaccine will mean the world falls short of providing herd immunity, leaving countries open to future COVID-19 resurgences.

Taking both remote sensing image attributes and airport characteristics into account, we put forward a subjective saliency model driven by multi-cues stimulus for the airport’s detection (MCS-SSM). Different from traditional saliency models, this model mainly relies on the subjective target detection task to find specific target area eliminating disturbance from other salient targets. Based on the low-level features, we train an LDA classifier by only small target samples and then build an object feature map. In the meantime, the shape information based on line density is extracted to get a shape map. Depending on the fusion result of two saliency maps, we optimize the subjective saliency map with SVM classifier. Moreover, MST density map is generated to suppress background and highlight interesting airport regions in the subjective saliency map. Consequently, MCS-SSM can respectively take the target, the background, and the detection task as multiple cues to quickly locate interest airport targets in RSI with a large cover area. MCS-SSM breaks through the limitations on color, texture, and other low-level characteristics compared with traditional saliency models, which are more targeted to detect the specific targets. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MCS-SSM outperforms nine state-of-the-art saliency models.

A lot of techniques have been proposed for extracting location-based information from social media, but none of these techniques aim to utilize an important characteristic of this data, which is the presence of aspects and their opinions, expressed by the users on these platforms. In this paper, we propose Geographic Aspect Opinion model (GASPOP), a probabilistic model that jointly discovers the variation of aspect and opinion, that correspond to different topics across various geographical regions from geo-tagged social media data. It incorporates the syntactic features of text in the generative process to differentiate aspect and opinion words from general background words. The user-based modeling of topics, also enables it to determine the interest distribution of various users. Furthermore, our model can be used to predict the location of different tweets based on their text.

To identify topics, the paper proposes an approach that combines peak detection and clustering techniques. Space-time features are extracted from the tweets and modeled as time series. After that, peaks are detected from the time series, and peaks of textual features are clustered based on the co-occurrence in the tweets. Each cluster obtained is then associated to a topic. Results, performed over a real-world dataset of tweets related to COVID-19 in US, show that the proposed approach is able to accurately detect several relevant topics of interest, of varying importance and character, including health status, symptoms, and pandemics implications on people living. A case study about the correlation of Twitter data with COVID-19 confirmed cases has been presented, also evaluating the feasibility of exploiting Twitter for the outbreak diffusion prediction. Results highlight a high correlation between tweets and real COVID-19 data, proving that Twitter can be considered a reliable indicator of the epidemic spreading and that data generated by user activity on social media is becoming an invaluable source for capturing and understanding epidemics outbreaks.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2021.3091281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9462520","COVID-19;social media data;topic modeling;peak detection;forecasting models","COVID-19;Social networking (online);Blogs;Feature extraction;Pandemics;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Information services;Epidemics","diseases;epidemics;information dissemination;medical information systems;social networking (online)","tweets;US;relevant topics;Twitter data;COVID-19 confirmed cases;COVID-19 data;epidemic spreading;epidemics outbreaks;COVID-19 information spread;COVID-19 epidemics;COVID-19 topics;peak detection;clustering techniques;space-time features;time series;textual features","","2","","37","IEEE","22 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hierarchical Bayesian models provide a natural mechanism to achieve this, and hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs) have shown significant impact in this field. HDPs define a collection of probability measures one for each group. All the measures provide support on a common countably infinite set of atoms to share information. The fundamental mechanism in all the variants of HDP make the weights on these atoms positively correlated across groups. This structural limitation is impossible to resolve without changing the sharing principle. But this property hinders the applicability of HDP priors to many problems, when an atom may be highly probable in some groups despite being rare in all other groups. This becomes evident in clustering through association of atoms and observations. Some clusters may be weakly present in most of the groups in spite of being prominent in some groups and vice-versa. In this paper, we pose the problem of weight agnosticism, that of constructing a collection of probability measures on a common countably infinite set of atoms with mutually independent weights across groups. This implies that, a cluster can contain observations from all groups, but popularities of a cluster across groups are mutually independent. So the size of a cluster in a group does not interfere in the participation of observations in other groups to that cluster. Our contribution is also to construct a novel hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric prior, Weight-Agnostic hierarchical Stick-breaking process (was), which models weight agnosticism. was extends the framework of stick-breaking process (SBP) in a novel direction. However, was becomes non-exchangeable and that makes inference process non-standard. But, We derive tractable predictive probability functions for was, which is useful in deriving efficient truncation-free MCMC inference competitive with those in HDP settings. We discuss few real life applications of was in topic moeling and information retrieval. Furthermore, experimenting with five real life datasets we show that, was significantly outperforms HDP in various settings.","","978-1-5386-9125-0","10.1109/ICBK.2018.00053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8588812","Bayesian nonparametrics, hierarchical models, topic models, rare clusters","Atomic measurements;Weight measurement;Bayes methods;Correlation;Extraterrestrial measurements;Predictive models;Conferences","Bayes methods;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering","HDP settings;statistical information;Hierarchical Bayesian models;hierarchical Dirichlet processes;probability measures;sharing principle;inference process;weight-agnostic hierarchical stick-breaking process;weight agnosticism;predictive probability function;words clustering;topic moeling;information retrieval","","1","","19","","27 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the benefits and increasing health information need for people who seek information in OHC, health information related to precautionary measures to avoid diseases, especially high-risk diseases, become critical because not all seeker and readers of health information are diagnosed with certain diseases. However, It has currently unidentified whether the text of the doctor's answer corpus, especially in high-risk diseases, contains words that imply precautionary. This study aims to find the pattern of doctor's answer for high-risk diseases through the corpus of doctor's answer text on OHC by identifying whether the doctor's answer text contains words that imply precautionary against disease. Thus, it can help health information seekers and readers take precautionary against disease early on. This paper's contribution was to identify precautionary measures from doctor's answer text for high-risk disease in 2014–2021 using the best model of the two models, namely Single LDA (only LDA Method) and Hybrid LDA (a combination of LDA and Collapsed Gibbs Sampling). The results showed that the best model was Hybrid LDA, and medical experts identified groups of words with this model into four domains, namely symptoms/diagnosis, treatments, precautionary measurements, and general text. The pattern that emerges from the identification of precautionary measures shows (1) which precautionary measures are divided based on what disease, (2) Some words that mean precautionary measures also mean treatment or symptom/diagnosis.","","978-1-6654-4346-3","10.1109/IES53407.2021.9593997","Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9593997","Topic Modeling;LDA Model;Collapsed Gibbs Sampling;Doctor's Answer Text;Precautionary Measures","COVID-19;Medical services;Data processing;Data models;Medical diagnostic imaging;Diseases","diseases;health care;medical expert systems;medical information systems;question answering (information retrieval);text analysis","OHC;high-risk disease;health information seekers;precautionary measurements;doctors answer text;LDA;online health consultation;medical experts","","","","15","IEEE","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How to accurately detect stance has become the primary goal of detecting fake news. This research aims to detect the news stance accurately, and we propose a method based on a pre-trained BERT language model. Most of the previous work only used the knowledge of single inference direction when classifying the stance, which may lose some important information. Therefore, we propose a bidirectional inference stance detection model, which can leverage bidirectional perspective information to classify the stance more comprehensively. We also define the stance detection task as a hierarchical structure task, and use the hierarchical classification and incorporate the topic information to help the stance classification.

In this paper, we develop a methodology that leverages behavioral data for the task of content skipping in an AES, i.e., detecting content segments that are unnecessary for a user and passing over them automatically. Our methodology contains three modules: (1) a Behavioral Data Processor, which converts user behaviors and course content into algorithm features including course topics, (2) a User State Tracer, which maintains an estimate of user knowledge state and interest on a per-topic basis, and (3) a Content Skipping Trigger, which determines the segments to be removed from the course for this user. In evaluating our approach on two real-world datasets collected from courses hosted on our existing platform, we find 80-90% accuracy in terms of identify segments that users would themselves eventually skip. In doing so, we also perform some exploratory analysis to show how the prediction results can help instructors to improve the course design quality.","","978-1-7281-4085-8","10.1109/CISS48834.2020.1570629135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086255","User Behavioral Modeling;Topic Modeling;Adaptive Learning","Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Discussion forums;Task analysis;Videos","behavioural sciences;computer aided instruction;educational courses","course topics;user knowledge state;per-topic basis;adaptive educational systems;AES;learning efficacy;course delivery;fine-granular behavioral data;keystroke measurements;lecture videos;social interactions;discussion forums;user behavioral modeling;content skipping trigger;user state tracer;behavioral data processor;adaptive content skipping methodology","","","","15","","7 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the past, various methods have been proposed to facilitate the service selection process based on the original functional descriptions. However, the mined features from the descriptions are usually too sparse for training a well-performed model. In addition, most methods neglect to differentiate the weights of various features, while words included in descriptions usually exhibit different intentions (e.g., functional or non-functional). To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a text expansion and deep model-based approach for service recommendation. Specifically, we first expand the description of services at sentence level based on a novel probabilistic topic model that learns topics of words, sentences and descriptions in a stratified fashion. The expansion process can bridge the vocabulary gap between services and user queries with the collective semantic similarity of sentences and descriptions. Then, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory-based model to recommend services with two attention mechanisms - a functional attention mechanism that takes tags as functional prior to mine the function-related features of services and Mashups, and a contextual attention mechanism that considers Mashup requirements as application scenario to help select the most appropriate services. We evaluate the proposed approach on a real-world dataset and the results show it has an improvement of 34 percent in F-measure over the basic LSTM model.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2018.2877363","Florida Center for Cybersecurity(grant numbers:FC2); Walter and Lalita Janke Innovations in Sustainability Science Research Fund(grant numbers:N_PolyU519/12); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872139,61572187); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8502148","Web service;mashup;recommendation;description expansion;attention mechanism","Mashups;Quality of service;Feature extraction;Vocabulary;Bicycles;Semantics","data mining;probability;recommender systems;recurrent neural nets;text analysis","deep model-based approach;service recommendation;novel probabilistic topic model;functional attention mechanism;function-related features;contextual attention mechanism;Mashup requirements;basic LSTM model;service selection process;original functional descriptions;functional attention-based LSTM;contextual attention-based LSTM;cloud computing;text expansion;collective semantic similarity;long short-term memory-based model;vocabulary gap","","29","","48","IEEE","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is expected to not only find much better matched Mashups with high accuracy, but also diversify the recommendation result of Web APIs with full coverage. Finally, based on a real-world dataset from ProgrammableWeb, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation to measure the performance of our method.

The substantially higher resolution of the Multispectral Instrument (MSI), on-board S2, with respect to the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), carried by S3, makes the former sensor a suitable spatial reference to finely adjust OLCI products. Nonetheless, the important spectral-spatial differences between both instruments may constrain traditional registration mechanisms to effectively align data of such different nature. In this context, the proposed registration scheme advocates the use of a topic model-based embedding approach to conduct the intersensor registration task within a common multispectral semantic space, where the input imagery is represented according to their corresponding spectral feature patterns instead of the low-level attributes. Thus, the OLCI products can be effectively registered to the MSI reference data by aligning those hidden patterns that fundamentally express the same visual concepts across the sensors. The experiments, conducted over four different S2 and S3 operational data collections, reveal that the proposed approach provides performance advantages over six different intersensor registration counterparts.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2019.2904874","Generalitat Valenciana(grant numbers:APOSTD/2017/007); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad(grant numbers:ESP2016-79503-C2-2-P,TIN2015-63646-C5-5-R); Junta de Extremadura(grant numbers:GR18060); European Union; H2020 EOXPOSURE(grant numbers:734541); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8680005","Image registration;multispectral imaging;remote sensing;Sentinel-2;Sentinel-3;topic modeling","Image registration;Remote sensing;Instruments;Semantics;Spatial resolution;Registers;Visualization","geophysical image processing;image colour analysis;image registration;remote sensing","intersensor remote sensing image registration;Sentinel-3 operational data;Sentinel-2 instrument;OLCI products;spectral-spatial differences;traditional registration mechanisms;common multispectral semantic space;MSI reference data;S3 operational data collections;multispectral semantic embeddings;higher resolution;Ocean and Land Color Instrument","","8","","18","IEEE","2 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our main motivation has been to determine if there were differences in how issues manifest themselves in iOS and Android, when we control for the projects, by considering the same apps across multiple platforms. In this paper, we compare issues across two mobile platforms - iOS and Android - for two open source browsers - Mozilla Firefox and Google Chromium. We consider three dimensions of study: frequency of issue report submission, fixing time of issues, and type of issues (using topic modeling on the issue description to generate the categories). We found that there were indeed differences; in particular, we found that there were more issues in the Android version of the apps and the gap with the iOS version is increasing. We observe that in both apps the fix time and type of issues are different for each platform. We also noted certain kinds of issues that may be more prevalent for different browser/platform combinations. This can advise project leads in identifying and allocating development resources to address key problem areas. Hence, issue reports seem more dependent on the platform than on the mobile app, making development and maintenance effort hard to estimate.","","978-1-7281-3395-9","10.1109/MOBILESoft.2019.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8816964","Issue repository;issue reports;issue fixing;Mozilla Firefox;empirical studies;Google Chromium;topic model","Chromium;Browsers;Smart phones;Google;Measurement;Operating systems","Android (operating system);iOS (operating system);mobile computing;online front-ends;program debugging;public domain software;smart phones","Android platforms;open source cross platform browser apps;Google Chromium;issue report submission;issue description;Android version;Google Android;Apple iOS;mobile platforms;open source browsers;Mozilla Firefox","","7","","41","","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The origin-destination (OD) datasets generated by human daily travel behavior reflect urban dynamics. Previous spatio-temporal analysis methods utilize these datasets to extract popular city areas, with the ignorance of the flow relationships between areas. Several methods have been unable to determine time steps with similar spatial characteristics automatically or failed to recognize the evolutionary patterns of various modalities for a city. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to discover the hidden semantic-level city dynamics from OD data. The method carries out spatial simplification and constructs a sequence of location networks at first. Then, the hourly network is studied as a document consisting of trip relationships among location clusters, enabling a semantic analysis of the OD dataset as a document corpus. Hidden themes, namely, traffic topics, are identified through a topic modeling technique in an unsupervised manner. Finally, an interactive visual analytics system is designed to intuitively demonstrate the probability-based thematic information and the evolutionary activity patterns of a city. The feasibility and validity of our method are demonstrated via case studies with two kinds of real-world datasets: bike-sharing system (BSS) dataset and taxi dataset. Semantic-level city structures and recurrent behaviors representing the life of a large set of users, as well as the differences in BSS usage patterns of two cities are discovered.

It is a challenging task because information provided by users on an SNS platform could be false, conflicting, missing and deceptive. One way to gain an accurate profile of a user is to link up all their multiple accounts created on different social platforms, which is referred to as Account Linkage (AL). However, existing AL techniques suffer from the problem of information unreliability. Recent advances in location acquisition and wireless communication technologies give rise to new opportunities for AL. In this paper, we propose a framework that links up multiple accounts belonging to the same individual by comparing habit patterns extracted from user-generated location data. We built a topic model to capture users habit patterns in both spatial and temporal dimensions.

One foundational step of building a proper visualization is to ensure accurate representations for the comprising services. However, it is not a trivial task as service profiles may not be sufficient for two significant reasons. First, while the services themselves being used in various scenarios, their profiles may not always precisely reflect all of them. Second, service profiles usually comprise quite a few universal background terms that cannot distinguish services. To address these two issues, we apply machine learning techniques to incrementally learn service representations in a whole. A tailored topic model is developed, named Service Representation-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SR-LDA). The core idea is to learn more comprehensive and up-to-date information about services from the profiles of the involved service compositions (i.e., mashup profiles), while introducing a global filter to identify and filter out background terms. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed SR-LDA builds higher-quality service representations comparing with baselines. We further generate a knowledge map to visualize a service ecosystem based on the learned service representations. Such a knowledge map directly leads to the detection of four typical functionality patterns of Web services and serves the purpose of mashup creation.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2020.3001307","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1402500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61673230); High-Tech Ship Research Project of China(grant numbers:17GC26102.01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9113339","Service representation;service visualization;service ecosystem;topic model;knowledge map","Mashups;Ecosystems;Visualization;Knowledge engineering;Resource management;Fans","image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems;Web services","build accurate Service representations;Web services;service ecosystem;people browse services;proper visualization;accurate representations;comprising services;service profiles;named Service Representation-Latent Dirichlet Allocation;involved service compositions;mashup profiles;higher-quality service representations;learned service representations","","1","","44","IEEE","10 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our work aims to consider the semantics of the text phrases in the clustering task, and to get full usage and exploitation of documents. The semantic web concept is overloaded with valuable techniques allowing the significant use of documents. Our goal is to take full advantage of these techniques.

They provide a semantic representation of data on which the clustering process will be based, to provide a more efficient clustering system.

However, the existing literature is still limited related to in-depth data-driven investigations of transfer patterns, particularly between metro and bus. In this study, we propose a generic framework to unravel latent transfer patterns at both aggregated and disaggregated levels. K-means clustering method is first used to classify metro stations based on surrounding built environment. We then introduce the cube technique which allows hierarchical aggregations for each dimension and cross-tabulations of massive ridership data. Last, we redesign the generative mechanism of the structural topic model that is capable of capturing the variability and interdependence in transfer patterns with passenger-level attributes. An empirical study is conducted with large-scale metro and bus smart card data, as well as built environment data in Nanjing, China. The results indicate intermodal transfers exhibit significant heterogeneous patterns in different transfer types over space and time. Although transfers per station in central business district (CBD) areas rank the highest, urban sprawl helps increase the utilization rate of transfer services in inner suburbs with most types of transfer behaviors. Strong correlations are identified among commuting transfer patterns, while correlations remain weak for pattern pairs between commuting and non-commuting activities, reflecting high consistency among commuting activities. Adults play a dominant role in commuting patterns in CBD areas and inner suburbs. Yet, students and the elderly are found to influence the pattern prevalence more effectively in outer suburbs and periphery areas.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3035719","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1601300); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71771049); Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Southeast University(grant numbers:YBPY1976); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9262066","Intermodal transfer;ridership cube;structural topic model;smart card data;passenger-level attribute;latent pattern","Smart cards;Data models;Analytical models;Urban areas;Probabilistic logic;Legged locomotion;Correlation","pattern clustering;smart cards;town and country planning;transportation","unraveling latent transfer patterns;large-scale smart card data;intermodal transfer patterns;integrated transit system;in-depth data-driven investigations;aggregated levels;disaggregated levels;metro stations;massive ridership data;passenger-level attributes;large-scale metro;bus smart card data;built environment data;intermodal transfers;significant heterogeneous patterns;different transfer types;transfer services;transfer behaviors;commuting transfer patterns;pattern pairs","","1","","56","IEEE","17 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the obtained analysis results, it is determined that COVID-19 does have an impact on the sentiment and relationships between university students. The change of behaviors has some similarity that includes a higher range of sentiment expressed during the pandemic, and a social network structure of communities with similar sizes between universities. Some difference has also been noticed, where the changes in sentiment is expressed in different topics that is based on local events, and the change of structure for smaller communities during the pandemic.

To purse this task, we have used topic modeling and sentimental analysis. We mined a collection of 97 million tweets extracted from Twitter. Subsequently, different filters are applied to get the most traffic-congested locations around the world and the top health issues in the corresponding areas. Additionally, we have performed sentimental analysis to get the public perception about the initiatives taken to improve the health issues in those regions. We have found 36 most traffic congested cities around the world, such as Mexico, Bangkok, Jakarta and Chongqing etc. Apart from that, heart diseases, respiratory and psychological problems are identified as the common problems in traffic congested cities.

In order to manage the research ecosystem, it is necessary to have sufficient knowledge about the research supply and demand. This study proposes a novel expert-independent framework to investigate the research supply and demand among the huge number of studies. In this framework, the combination of quantitative, bibliographic, and content analysis methods is applied via text mining techniques. To evaluate the proposed framework, environmental data from the Iran scientific information database is used (Ganj)1 as a rich database. It includes more than 513,000 supplied records and more than 78 million search queries as the research demands. To analyze the research supply and demand, the research topics are extracted via the topic modeling approach from both the supply and demand side. The results showed that the educational category of environmental studies is moved from medical science to engineering in the last decades. Moreover, the gap analysis between research supply and demand identified “Extraction” and “Tourism” as hot topics, “Education,” “Management,” and “Culture” as cold topics, “Soil” and “Energy” as silent topics and finally, “International Rights” and “River” as gap topics. The findings can support environmental policymakers and research managers in making decisions and identifying environmental research needs and priorities. The proposed framework for other research areas can be used to examine and balance research supply and demand.","1937-4178","","10.1109/EMR.2022.3179238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785853","Environment;gap analysis;research ecosystem;research supply and demand;topic modeling","Supply and demand;Databases;Organizations;Market research;Bibliometrics;Sentiment analysis;Analytical models","","","","","","50","IEEE","31 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, we attempt to use the state-of-the-art data mining and visualization techniques to solve this problem. Using the traffic data, we design a visual analytics system named IBBAS (Intelligent Bus Body Advertising System). This system can deal with two main challenges of the problem: new brand promotion and target group advertising. First, we propose two algorithms: DivideT and EstimateT. DivideT is used for the bus frequency division and EsitimateT is used for the bus arrival time estimation. Then, based on LDA topic model, we design an optimization algorithm to generate bus body advertising solution based on multiple constraints. Finally, we use the visualization techniques to create a system. There are some functional modules used in the system: the heatmap changing with time displays the passenger flow volume of each bus station; the candidate panel allows users to expediently modify the original solution and forms a tailored solution; the compare panel clearly uncovers the differences among multiple solutions with a flexible ranking tool. This system has been demonstrated using case studies with a real-world dataset. We also collected feedback from domain experts and conducted a preliminary evaluation criteria.","","978-1-5386-3151-5","10.1109/PDCAT.2017.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8327068","bus body advertising;data mining;visualization;DivideT;EstimateT;LDA topic model;multiple constraints;optimization algorithm","Advertising;Feature extraction;Data visualization;Tools;Data mining;Visual analytics;Urban areas","advertising data processing;data analysis;data mining;data visualisation;optimisation;public transport","Intelligent Bus Body Advertising System;DivideT;bus frequency division;bus arrival time estimation;bus station;public transit system;optimization algorithm;EstimateT;visualization;group advertising;passenger flow volume;data mining;large-scale traffic data;visual analytics system;IBBAS","","","","22","","29 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results indicate that Arabic language tweets, during the Ramadan period, included more religious themes than did English tweets. Also, relative to English, Arabic tweets showed greater consistency of content during the three months of the study (before, during and after Ramadan). English content varied significantly over the three months with notable fluctuations in the frequency of content centering on the music, shopping, and health categories.

Exploiting such data for this challenging popular task has not yet been done much in the educational data mining field. In this paper, we propose the information retrieval-based approach to return an in-trouble student list from the ranking of all the students after temporally grouping them together. In this approach, a temporal educational data clustering method is proposed as an ensemble method by stacking the temporal clusters from a dynamic topic model on temporal data with kernel k-means. The ensemble learning process is further optimized with an internal validation scheme using S_Dbw. The resulting method, DTM_Kernel, can provide better clusters for final relevance-based retrieval as examining the students with all of their study performance over time. Its effectiveness has been confirmed with the better experimental results on three different real datasets over three academic years. Indeed, it has higher Recall and F-measure than several other unsupervised and supervised learning-based methods for correct prediction of in-trouble students. It also outperforms some other direct retrieval methods for a resulting list of in-trouble students. As a result, our approach has formed an effective solution to the early in-trouble student identification task.","","978-1-7281-6052-8","10.1109/ICIT48102.2019.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9031978","In trouble student identification, dynamic topic modeling, kernel k-means, S_Dbw, temporal data clustering","Task analysis;Kernel;Urban areas;Clustering methods;Data models;Data mining;Stacking","data mining;educational administrative data processing;information retrieval;pattern clustering;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","ensemble learning process;unsupervised learning-based methods;academic credit system;educational data mining field;information retrieval-based approach;in-trouble student list;temporal educational data clustering method;early in-trouble student identification;kernel k-means;supervised learning-based methods","","","","19","","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on such motivation, we refer to sentiment analysis and the topic model to fully exploit the emotion information of each attribute in the comments. By obtaining the similarity in the attribute plane of users and combining with the similarity of the overall rating of users, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm called ASAR (attribute-based sentiment analysis for recommendation). Experiments show that mean absolute deviation is in the limitation of 0.5 points, which prove that ASAR has a certain improvement in the accuracy of recommendation, our proposed method plays an important role in the development of recommendation algorithm.","","978-1-5386-8339-2","10.1109/CompComm.2018.8781065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8781065","component;sentiment analyis;LDA topic model;recommendation algorithm;comment","Sentiment analysis;Prediction algorithms;Mathematical model;Filtering algorithms;Vocabulary;Training;Filtering","data mining;recommender systems;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","information society;recommendation algorithm;emotion information;attribute-based sentiment analysis for recommendation;ASAR;mean absolute deviation","","","","14","","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This abundance of literature, however, raised another problem. It has indeed become extremely difficult for a researcher or a decision-maker to stay up to date with the latest scientific advances or to locate scientific articles related to a specific aspect of this pandemic. In this paper, we present an intelligent tool based on Machine learning, which automatically organizes a large dataset of Covid-19 related scientific literature and visualizes them in a way that helps these people navigating easily through this dataset and locating the sought documents easily. The documents are first pre-processed and transformed into numerical features. Then, those features are passed through a deep denoising autoencoder followed by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection technique (UMAP) to reduce their dimensionality into a 2D space. The projected data are then clustered with Agglomerative Clustering Algorithm. This is followed by a topic modeling step which we performed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), in order to assign a label to each cluster.

They can learn the model adaptively and be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a good machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good model training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the performance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the machine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each procedure to guarantee a totally good machine learning: diversity of the training data ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information for the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each model or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model capture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can provide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible local optimal result. Even though diversity plays an important role in the machine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the diversification in the machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically summarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and inference diversification in the machine learning process. In addition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the machine learning performance have been surveyed including the remote sensing imaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation, object detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some challenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some directions in future work.

However, existing research focuses only on assimilation to North American culture, overlooking the mutual influence, with a very limited use of data-driven approaches. In this paper, we investigate assimilation among various cultures in North America through the lens of discussions surrounding food. We first present Cross-Cuisine Cross-Region LDA (c3rLDA), a novel probabilistic graphical model to jointly uncover latent topics shared across cuisines, as well as their regional variants for each cuisine. Then, we employ the model on 3.7 million Yelp restaurant reviews to find that cuisines assimilate to one another in varying degrees depending on the cuisines involved, the topic, and the region: A cuisine tends to be more influenced by other cuisines if it is regularly fused with others (e.g. Japanese), for certain topics (e.g. breakfast and dessert), and in specific regions (e.g. stronger Mexican influence in the Southwestern US and French influence in the East Canada). Lastly, we demonstrate that the topics generated by our model, on which the qualitative analysis is based, are more coherent than or comparable to those generated by existing neural and non-neural topic models.

Also, it is quite difficult to make predictions about stock prices or market trends purely based on historical data. This paper proposes a variation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on a dataset of financial news items and historical data of the S&P 500 to effectively mine out words that can later be used as important features for various machine learning models with an aim to predict market trends and more specifically crash/boom in the stock market.

Topic modelling is crucial for software reuse since it can be difficult for developers to remove obsolete source code from large software systems with a lot of code. Topic modelling techniques has been used to evaluate and model source codes in several ways. Several studies on this domain have been used to extract topics from source codes using various statistical approaches and methodologies. These topic extraction methods are interconnected, and if software best practices aren't followed in older systems, it may ensue unreliability of the outcome. In response to these findings, the author conducted a study in which he extracted source code using a java parser library and predicted the source code functionality name using an unsupervised learning approach such as K-mean algorithm and Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering approach.

Although recent advances in deep learning (DL) enables models to extract interpretable features from unstructured data, they often require a large amount of training data. However, many tasks in medical domains inherently consist of small sample data with lengthy documents; for a kidney transplant as an example, data from only a few thousand of patients are available and each patient's document consists of a couple of millions of words in major hospitals. Thus, complex DL methods cannot be applied to these kind of domains. In this paper, we present a comprehensive ensemble model using vector space modeling and topic modeling. Our proposed model is evaluated on the readmission task of kidney transplant patients, and improves 0.0211 in terms of c-statistics from the previous state-of-the-art approach using structured data, while typical DL methods fails to beat this approach.

The problem becomes more complex when the data in question have a low variance in terms of topical diversity. Therefore, an automatic method for understanding textual patterns in such topically constrained data needs to be developed. A major challenge to building such a system is in its ability to comprehend the nature of the data with regard to diversity of word structure correlations, vocabulary sparsity, and distinguishing factors in the generated topics. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised approach called metamodel enabled latent Dirichlet allocation to address this challenge.

Thus we propose a method for selecting titles for segments in long documents. We analyze the characteristics of high quality titles for article segments, from the aspect of semantic relatedness between the target segment and related articles as well as other segments. Then we revise three features proposed before. We improve the phraseness feature, for giving appropriate scores for long titles. Meanwhile, we combine the features SimPF and Embedding-vector to enhance the efficiency and rationality. We use Wikipedia articles for experimental evaluations, in which a large number of article segments are titled manually, and a great number of articles lack detailed segment titles. We evaluate scoring functions by where hidden original segment titles are ranked, through precision@K.

A key element of our approach is the modeling of the researcher's thematic centers of interest derived from his corpus (a set of articles that interested him). In this perspective we use the technique of semantic exploration and extraction of latent topics in document corpora, LDA(Latent DirichletAllocation), an unsupervised learning method which offers the best solution of scalability problemcompared to other techniques of topic modeling. this technique allows us to build a profile model in the form of vectors in which the components are the probabilistic distributions on topics that reflect the interests of the researcher. The profile models thus constructed will be grouped into thematic clusters based on dominant topics using the fuzzy clustering algorithm, since the same topic can be treated in different scientific fields. Will follow a step of detection of community structures in thematic clusters to identify significant communities, the aim of this step is to project the recommendation process in a small space allowing better performance by reducing the computation time and the storage space for researcher/article data. The preliminary results of the experience of our approach on a population of 13 researchers and 60 articles shows that the articles generated by the recommendation process are very relevant to the target researcher or his community.","","978-1-7281-6403-8","10.1109/OCTA49274.2020.9151729","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9151729","LDA;Recommender system;academic social network;community detection;the fuzzy clustering algorithm","Social network services;Filtering;Collaboration;Probabilistic logic;Clustering algorithms;Data models;Semantics","data mining;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;recommender systems;social networking (online);unsupervised learning","recommender systems;detection community;academic social network;cognitive overload;scientific article recommendation;thematic community structures;topological structure;cold start problems;sparcity data;semantic exploration;latent topics;unsupervised learning;topic modeling;profile model;thematic clusters;fuzzy clustering algorithm;scientific fields;recommendation process","","","","40","","29 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, we first exploit the latent topic model for analyzing event description text and establish each user a long-term interest model and short-term interest model from her event registration history. We next establish each event an influence weight to jointly represent its social impact among users and its semantic uniqueness among events. For one user, we select her neighbors according to their long-term interest similarities weighted by events' influences. For new event recommendation, we construct a user-event rating matrix based on users' short-term interest models and for each user, we compute event rating predictions from her neighbors' ratings.

The model can construct dynamic knowledge graphs that contain instructional concepts and educational relations for learners. Specifically, it adopts the mutual information and adjacent information entropy to detect new terminologies on pedagogical data, and then the topic modeling algorithm is utilized to extract instructional concepts. Moreover, the model employs association rule mining to identify the prerequisite relations and uses pattern matching to obtain the inclusion relations.

We are concerned in getting the query answers efficiently from the data collected by usingLatent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) in pipeline to the TI-IDF model. One algorithm which will be used with pipeline to the TI-IDF is LDA. LDA is a technique that automatically discovers topics that these documents contain. Another model which we are exploring is the LSI which also will be used with TI-IDF model for preparing the model for getting query answers efficiently. On these parameter we will be building the model training and finally will compare the models for finding which model works best in terms of efficiency, accuracy and complexity.","","978-1-5386-4119-4","10.1109/ICACCCN.2018.8748618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8748618","TI-IDF;LDA;LSI;mongoDb;information retrieval","Agriculture;Large scale integration;Data models;Semantics;Matrix converters;Pipelines;Buildings","data mining;indexing;query processing;text analysis","data scientist;kisan call center data;topic modelling;LSI;latent Dirichlet allocation;LDA;latent semantic indexing;TI-IDF model;query answering","","","","7","","1 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g. Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based (“keyword”) approach. At the same time our approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the latter. The result is a workflow for standardising populations of entities, with reduced need for manual review. In cases where only a subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing entity variations.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006392","SWIFT;hierarchical clustering;similarity features;named entity normalization","Pipelines;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Gold;Natural languages;Measurement;Indexes","data mining;feature extraction;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern clustering;social networking (online);text analysis","Twitter posts;cluster refinement;rule-based systems;baseline rule-based approach;real-life labelled dataset;hierarchical clustering;topic modelling;hybrid string similarity;fuzzy matching tools;trace funds;payment flow originator;sentence structure;legal entity details;bank payment;natural language models;part-of-speech;natural language techniques;natural language domain;text analytics community;short text clustering;feature extraction;SWIFT message counterparties","","","","23","","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach makes it possible to produce a robust estimate of the spatial distribution of the target, even in the absence of direct target observations. We apply the proposed approach to the problem of finding the spatial locations of the hotspots of a specific phytoplankton taxon in the ocean. We use classified image data from Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB), which automatically measures individual microscopic cells and colonies of cells. Given these individual taxon-specific observations, we learn a phytoplankton community model that characterizes the co-occurrence relations between taxa. We present experiments with simulated robot missions drawn from real observation data collected during a research cruise traversing the US Atlantic coast. Our results show that the proposed approach outperforms nearest neighbor and k-means based methods for predicting the spatial distribution of hotspots from in-situ observations.","","978-1-5090-4633-1","10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7989568","","Data models;Computational modeling;Robots;Oceans;Training;Predictive models;Sea measurements","Bayes methods;estimation theory;geophysical image processing;image classification;marine control;microorganisms;nonparametric statistics;oceanographic techniques;robot vision","phytoplankton hotspot prediction;unsupervised spatial community model;sparsely distributed phenomena;density gradient;co-occurrence relations;robot observations;Bayesian nonparametric topic model;robust estimation;spatial distribution;hotspot spatial locations;phytoplankton taxon;image data classification;imaging FlowCytobot;IFCB;microscopic cells;cell colonies;phytoplankton community model;robot missions","","1","","18","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of its different core dependencies, it can be applied to many topics, such as emotion detection, information systems or image clustering. In recent works, researchers have focused on novel dependency to obtain perfect fitting to datasets. However, real world data is too diverse and abundant to be fitted with one single dependency. A single dependency model can only concentrate on the overall characteristic of datasets and thus ignores small details in the data. In addition, model selection for different situation is always difficult. As a result, we propose Multi-dependent Latent Dirichlet Allocation (MD-LDA). MD-LDA can be applied various dependencies into the model. We don't need to select a specific model. For each piece of data, MD-LDA can pick up the most optimal fitting dependency from the dependency set and therefore obtain the best dependencies for the dataset. We also apply some previous works into MD-LDA as a basis for comparison. In our experiments, MD-LDA exhibits the best performance in various cases and is an improvement compared to the other models under consideration.","2376-6824","978-1-5386-4203-0","10.1109/TAAI.2017.51","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8356928","","Data models;Resource management;Merging;Electronic mail;Text mining;Social network services","data mining;emotion recognition;pattern clustering;text analysis","dataset;single dependency model;MD-LDA;optimal fitting dependency;information systems;image clustering;topic model research;multidependent latent Dirichlet allocation;emotion detection;core dependencies","","","","25","","10 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach for discovering coherent hotel aspects based on the user attention. This model effectively integrates techniques like topic modeling and word embeddings along with the frequent noun-adjective co-occurrence statistics to automatically discover coherent hotel aspects. Further supervised methods are used to understand the user's relative emphasis on the aspects and finally rank the hotels. This method does not assume any predefined seed words and discovers coherent level aspects by directly using user attention and word co-occurrence statistics in addition to topic modeling and word embeddings. The performance evaluation of this method was done by collecting various hotel reviews from multiple travel websites. Results show that the proposed methods improved the baseline performance up to 90%.

With infections soaring rapidly, users took to Twitter asking people to self isolate and quarantine themselves. Users also demanded closure of schools, bars, and restaurants as well as lockdown of cities and states. We methodically collect tweets by identifying and tracking trending COVID-related hashtags. We first manually group the hashtags into six main categories, namely, 1) General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) Panic Buying, 4) School Closures, 5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope, and study the temporal evolution of tweets in these hashtags. We conduct a linguistic analysis of words common to all hashtag groups and specific to each hashtag group and identify the chief concerns of people as the pandemic gripped the nation (e.g., exploring bidets as an alternative to toilet paper). We conduct sentiment analysis and our investigation reveals that people reacted positively to school closures and negatively to the lack of availability of essential goods due to panic buying. We adopt a state-of-the-art semantic role labeling approach to identify the action words (e.g., fear, test), which capture the actions people are referring to in the tweets. We then leverage an LSTM-based dependency parsing model to analyze the context of the above-mentioned action words (e.g., verb deal is accompanied by nouns such as anxiety, stress, and crisis). Finally, we develop a scalable seeded topic modeling approach to automatically categorize and isolate tweets into hashtag groups and experimentally validate that our topic model provides a grouping similar to our manual grouping. Our study presents a systematic way to construct an aggregated picture of peoples' response to the pandemic and lays the groundwork for future fine-grained linguistic and behavioral analysis.","","978-1-6654-1485-2","10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom51426.2020.00132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9443943","","COVID-19;Sentiment analysis;Systematics;Pandemics;Social networking (online);Blogs;Urban areas","grammars;natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis","analyzing societal impact;COVID-19;early days;pandemic;study Twitter communications;United States;tweets;identifying tracking;COVID-related hashtags;manually group;General COVID;hashtag group;toilet paper;school closures;behavioral analysis;fine-grained linguistic analysis;peoples;manual grouping;scalable seeded topic modeling approach;above-mentioned action words;actions people;state-of-the-art semantic role labeling approach","","1","","21","","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Topic modeling is popularly performed on text data for mining inherent topics. The task of finding the latent topics in textual data is done in an unsupervised manner. In this work we propose a novel clustering technique for BA which can find hidden routines in ubiquitous data and also captures the pattern in the routines. Our approach efficiently works on high dimensional data for BA without performing any computationally expensive reduction operations. We evaluate three different techniques namely LDA, the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) for comparative study. We have analyzed the efficiency of the methods by using performance indices like perplexity and silhouette on three real-world ubiquitous sensor datasets namely, the Intel Lab Data, Kyoto Data, and MERL data.

While various curriculum design and instructional methods have been explored in recent years, an effective way to assess students' novel discoveries and creativity remains a great challenge. This paper investigates into a relatively new text analytics computational approach to facilitate instructors of identifying and assessing the concrete evidences of students' achievements under a DEC-based pedagogical approach. In particular, we illustrate a topic modeling-based text mining method which can extract the hidden intents and creative ideas of students embedded in their project work. According to our best knowledge, this is one of the few successful research work of applying a topic modeling method to enhance the assessment of students' achievements under a DEC pedagogical approach.

The Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) is one of the most widely used models in current scene classification research. Acquisition of appropriate codewords number in BoVW Model is a key step in BoVW model. The classical framework to acquire the appropriate number of codewords needs to cluster the codewords by K-Means for many iterations, rendering its high computation cost. In the current study, an improved framework was proposed to acquire the appropriate number of codewords automatically, and corresponding scene classification performance with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model was investigated.

Such dangers may put crews at risk and potentially cause extensive damage to both the vessel and its cargo. Maritime risk assessment is a process of analyzing such factors to positively impact the safety and timeliness of operations. Analyzing the high-risk areas in seas and oceans can help vessels route around areas with previously recorded high levels of dangerous activities. This information is scraped and extracted from various maritime documents, including newspaper articles, social media, incident blogs, and operational reports. After textual data sources are parsed, it is possible to use this extracted information as training datasets into a Machine Learning (ML) model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Deep Learning (DL) techniques. With these methods, we can perform document classification, risk extraction, text summarization, topic modeling, and information extraction in an automated manner. Methods that are used include the bag-of words (BOW) approach and, in particular, the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify specific areas around the world that are considered a risk to a particular voyage. Once this information is processed, the model can determine and aggregate specific areas of high-risk activity. We propose a Maritime Event Log (MEL) pipeline using DL methods. This pipeline includes binary document classification (DC) to extract positive instances of incidents, an incident type classification (IC,) and an information extraction module (IE) including date and location and ship type extraction. With such information available, it is possible to avoid dangerous situations, which may have a significant level of impact on the safety and success rate of maritime operations.","","978-1-7281-2547-3","10.1109/SSCI47803.2020.9308441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9308441","","Hidden Markov models;Pipelines;Bit error rate;Information retrieval;Classification algorithms;Training;Text categorization","deep learning (artificial intelligence);information retrieval;marine engineering;marine safety;natural language processing;pattern classification;risk management;ships;text analysis","maritime risk assessment;maritime vessels;safety;vessels route;maritime documents;newspaper articles;social media;incident blogs;operational reports;textual data sources;natural language processing;risk extraction;topic modeling;bag-of words approach;high-risk activity;binary document classification;incident type classification;information extraction module;ship type extraction;maritime operations;deep learning techniques;machine learning model;text summarization;named entity recognition;maritime event log pipeline","","1","","13","","5 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, NLP methods are applied primarily to specialized texts, such as scientific literature, technical documentation, news, etc., or social media discourse. Fiction texts are usually left out of the focus of NLP practitioners as the fictional world seems to be of less significance or less “information value” from a practical point of view. Moreover, due to the poetic and metaphorical nature of literary texts, the use of some NLP methods (e.g., topic modelling) for fiction analysis turned out to be more complicated. At the same time, the influence of literature both on the consciousness of individuals and on the formation of social values can hardly be overestimated. Besides, making computers “understand” fiction in a similar way as humans do would be a real challenge for artificial intelligence. The article puts forward the idea of modelling thematic areas of literature on a national scale, which should reveal the main thematic domains of national literature as a whole. It will allow a better understanding of the cultural traits of the national consciousness in a given historical period and contribute to either literary studies or practical tasks. Methodological approaches to determining and modelling themes of literary works are considered, technical difficulties arising in the process are described, and the ways to solve them are suggested. The proposed methodology has been implemented in the design of the corpus of Russian short stories of 1900-1930s and can be applied in the development of artificial intelligence systems that process large volumes of literary texts in any language.","2305-7254","978-952-69244-5-8","10.23919/FRUCT52173.2021.9435451","National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE)(grant numbers:21-04-053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9435451","","Training;Technological innovation;Annotations;Computational modeling;Data collection;Data models;Artificial intelligence","artificial intelligence;literature;natural language processing;text analysis","technical documentation;social media discourse;fiction texts;NLP practitioners;poetic nature;metaphorical nature;literary texts;topic modelling;fiction analysis;social values;thematic domains;national literature;national consciousness;literary works;Russian short stories;artificial intelligence systems;automatic modelling;technical issues;digital analytics;computer text processing;speech technologies;scientific literature;cultural traits","","1","","78","","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Building on the notions of user travel styles (UTSs) and the wisdom of crowds, we propose a method derived from topic-model-based models to represent travel attractions, called the Normalized Attraction Travel Personality (NATP) representation. This approach attempts to leverage the semantics of attraction reviews to model user travel personalities (UTPs), which collectively can construct the attraction travel personality (ATP) representation. Furthermore, we regularize and normalize the ATP representation to obtain our proposed representation. This NATP-based attraction representation could capture implicit characteristics of attractions revealed by the wisdom of crowds. Our experiments show that our representation method gained better results when evaluated against comparative approaches in terms of rating prediction and recommendation ranking quality, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed attraction representation.

However limited studies considered the complexity in processing such information to predict traffic incident duration. In this paper, we propose to represent the textual data from incident reports using BERT word embeddings. These text representations are then inputted into various regressors such as LSTM, XGBoost, RF and SVR to predict traffic incident duration. To demonstrate the significance of this approach, the method is compared with the state-of-the-art approach using LDA representation.

While EHRs contain structured data such as diagnostic codes and laboratory tests, they also contain unstructured clinical notes, which provide more nuanced details on a patient's health status. In this work, we propose a method that jointly learns medical concept and word representations. In particular, we focus on capturing the relationship between medical codes and words by using a novel learning scheme for word2vec model. Our method exploits relationships between different parts of EHRs in the same visit and embeds both codes and words in the same continuous vector space. In the end, we are able to derive clusters which reflect distinct disease and treatment patterns.

Question retrieval in a CQA archive aims to identify and retrieve existing questions that are relevant to new user questions. The objective of this study is to develop a question retrieval system that can sift through such forums and identify existing questions which are most similar to the user-provided question.

In particular, we employ HDP to combine clinical time series and text from the nursing progress notes in a probabilistic topic modeling framework for patient risk stratification. Given a patient cohort, we use HDP to infer latent “topics” shared across multimodal patient data from the entire cohort. Each topic is modeled as a multinomial distribution over a vocabulary of codewords, defined over heterogeneous data sources. We evaluate the clinical utility of the learned topic structure using the first 24-hour ICU data from over 17,000 adult patients in the MIMIC-II database to estimate patients' risks of in-hospital mortality.

To represent the semantics, we apply probabilistic topic modeling. After extracting a set of topics and representing the texts by vectors of topic weights, we aggregate the data into a data cube with the dimensions corresponding to the set of topics, the set of spatial locations (e.g., regions), and the time divided into suitable intervals according to the scale of the planned analysis. Each cube cell corresponds to a combination (topic, location, time interval) and contains aggregate measures characterizing the subset of the texts concerning this topic and having the spatial and temporal references within these location and interval. Based on this structure, we systematically describe the space of analysis tasks on exploring the interrelationships among the three heterogeneous information facets, semantics, space, and time. We introduce the operations of projecting and slicing the cube, which are used to decompose complex tasks into simpler subtasks. We then present a design of a visual analytics system intended to support these subtasks. To reduce the complexity of the user interface, we apply the principles of structural, visual, and operational uniformity while respecting the specific properties of each facet. The aggregated data are represented in three parallel views corresponding to the three facets and providing different complementary perspectives on the data. The views have similar look-and-feel to the extent allowed by the facet specifics. Uniform interactive operations applicable to any view support establishing links between the facets. The uniformity principle is also applied in supporting the projecting and slicing operations on the data cube.

Not only does it introduce performance issues due to the huge number of documents, there is even bigger challenges in that most of the data are unlabeled. The arrival of social media and blogging has increased web data as well. Thus the machine learning community has taken up the interest in using unsupervised learning in classification of such big data. New learning called semi-supervised learning relies on assumptions that unlabeled data can help bring interesting patterns, which the industry can use. The study uses the Probability Latent Semantic Analysis algorithm which is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to retrieve information based on latent classes of documents and terms. PLSA is the topic modeling tool used by the study to deduce hidden topics across the documents by looking at the terms and documents and inferring using the Expectation Maximization algorithm which words belong to which topic. The model was used to discover if given documents infer one or more topics. The study concluded that the PLSA algorithm is more efficient on processed data than raw web data and processing time was reduced when preprocessing was used to eliminate redundant latent variables. An increase of k, the number of topics improved the topic quality.","","978-1-5386-9236-3","10.1109/ICABCD.2019.8851032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8851032","Expectation Maximization;PLSA;LSA","Semantics;Probabilistic logic;Crawlers;Mathematical model;Classification algorithms;Analytical models","data mining;expectation-maximisation algorithm;information retrieval;natural language processing;pattern classification;probability;social networking (online);text analysis;unsupervised learning","probability latent semantic analysis algorithm;information source;machine learning community;semisupervised learning;latent classes;topic modeling tool;PLSA algorithm;Web documents;expectation maximization algorithm;raw Web data;unsupervised Web mined data;document annotation;collaboration filtering;social media blogging;unsupervised machine learning algorithm","","","","50","","30 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is important to determine the symptom effect level for the emotions of symptomatic persons based on their opinions. However, no study analyzes the tweets' sentiment related to the COVID-19 topic to predict the symptoms effect level. Therefore, in this study, we present a method to predict the symptoms effect level based on the sentiment analysis of symptomatic persons according to the following steps. First, the sentiments in tweets are analyzed by using a combination of the text representation model and convolutional neural network. Second, a topic modeling model is built based on the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm to group symptoms into small clusters that conform to sadness and fear sentiments. Finally, the symptom effect level is predicted based on the probability distribution of the symptoms in each sentiment cluster.

The goals of this retrospective study are to identify dominant topics of Twitter-based research, summarize the temporal trend of topics, and interpret the evolution of topics withing the last ten years. This study systematically mines a large number of Twitter-based studies to characterize the relevant literature by an efficient and effective approach.

In our method, we recommend Top-K code snippets for a given free-form query based on two stages, i.e., coarse-grained searching and fine-grained re-ranking. First, we generate a code snippet candidate set by searching a code snippet corpus using an information retrieval method. Second, we predict probability values of the code snippets for different relevance scores in the candidate set by the learned prediction model from a training set, re-rank these candidate code snippets according to the probability values, and recommend the final results to developers. We conduct several experiments to evaluate our method in a large-scale corpus containing 921,713 real-world code snippets.

Since some grid cells do not have check-in records, there are some null entries in the matrix, and all the entries are reconstructed by matrix factorization. Meanwhile, a POI (point of interest) category dataset is exploited to build a grid cell-grid cell similarity matrix, which is used to reduce the loss of matrix factorization.

Thanks to dedicated latent topic analysis methods such as the Ailment Topic Aspect Model (ATAM), public health can now be observed on Twitter. In this work, we are interested in using social media to monitor people's health overtime. The use of tweets has several benefits including instantaneous data availability at virtually no cost. Early monitoring of health data is complementary to post-factum studies and enables a range of applications such as measuring behavioral risk factors and triggering health campaigns. We formulate two problems: health transition detection and health transition prediction. We first propose the Temporal Ailment Topic Aspect Model (TM-ATAM), a new latent model dedicated to solving the first problem by capturing transitions that involve health-related topics. TM-ATAM is a non-obvious extension to ATAM that was designed to extract health-related topics. It learns health-related topic transitions by minimizing the prediction error on topic distributions between consecutive posts at different time and geographic granularities. To solve the second problem, we develop T-ATAM, a Temporal Ailment Topic Aspect Model where time is treated as a random variable natively inside ATAM. Our experiments on an 8-month corpus of tweets show that TM-ATAM outperforms TM-LDA in estimating health-related transitions from tweets for different geographic populations. We examine the ability of TM-ATAM to detect transitions due to climate conditions in different geographic regions. We then show how T-ATAM can be used to predict the most important transition and additionally compare T-ATAM with CDC (Center for Disease Control) data and Google Flu Trends.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2018.2795606","CDP LIFE Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8263414","Public health;ailments;social media;topic models","Monitoring;Twitter;Data models;Random variables;Sociology;Statistics","diseases;health care;medical computing;social networking (online)","health data;behavioral risk factors;health transition detection;health transition prediction;TM-ATAM;latent model;health-related topic transitions;topic distributions;tweets;health-related transitions;health monitoring;social media;public health;instantaneous data availability;temporal ailment topic aspect model;latent topic analysis methods;Twitter","","14","","31","IEEE","18 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most traditional recommendation algorithms rely on the original service descriptions given by service providers. It is detrimental to the recommendation performance because original service descriptions often lack comprehensiveness and pertinence in describing possible application scenarios, let alone the possible language gap existing between service providers and mashup developers. To solve the above issues, a novel method of Targeted Reconstructing Service Descriptions (TRSD) for a specific mashup query is proposed, resorting to the valuable information hidden in mashup descriptions. TRSD aims at introducing mashup descriptions into service descriptions by analyzing the similarity between existing mashups and the specific query, while leveraging service system structure information. Benefit from this approach, missing application scenarios in original service descriptions, query-specific application scenario information, mashup developers' language habits, and service system structure information are all integrated into the reconstructed service descriptions. Based on the reconstructed service description by TRSD, a new service recommendation strategy is developed. Comprehensive experiments on the real-world data set from ProgrammableWeb.com show that the overall MAP of the proposed TRSD model is 6.5% better than the state-of-the-art methods.","","978-1-5386-0752-7","10.1109/ICWS.2017.44","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029773","service recommendation;mashup creation;service descriptions;mashup descriptions;LDA topic model","Mashups;Facebook;Collaboration;Filtering;Quality of service;Feature extraction","query processing;recommender systems;Web services","service recommendation;targeted reconstructing service descriptions;TRSD;mashup query;mashup descriptions;query-specific application scenario information;service system structure information;ProgrammableWeb.com;MAP","","13","","22","","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) can help remediate this problem by exploiting non-traditional information sources, such as hacker forums and ""dark-web"" social platforms. Security and response teams can use the collected intelligence to identify emerging threats. Unfortunately, when manual analysis is used to extract CTI from non-traditional sources, it is a time consuming, error-prone and resource intensive process. We address these issues by using a hybrid Machine Learning model that automatically searches through hacker forum posts, identifies the posts that are most relevant to cyber security and then clusters the relevant posts into estimations of the topics that the hackers are discussing. The first (identification) stage uses Support Vector Machines and the second (clustering) stage uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We tested our model, using data from an actual hacker forum, to automatically extract information about various threats such as leaked credentials, malicious proxy servers, malware that evades AV detection, etc. The results demonstrate our method is an effective means for quickly extracting relevant and actionable intelligence that can be integrated with traditional security controls to increase their effectiveness.","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622469","Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI);Cyber Security;Hacker Forums;Machine Learning;Topic Modeling;Text Classification;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;LDA;Support Vector Machines;SVM","Computer hacking;Support vector machines;Vocabulary;Resource management;Malware;Machine learning algorithms","computer crime;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","hacker forums;cyber threat landscape;CTI;nontraditional information sources;hacker forum posts;two-stage hybrid process;support vector machines;latent dirichlet allocation;security controls;cyber threat intelligence;hybrid machine learning model;leaked credentials;malicious proxy servers;malware;AV detection","","13","","22","","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Second, different parts of the text can contribute differently to predicting different emotion labels, so the proposed model needs to capture effective features for each corresponding emotion, which is not considered by existing models. To tackle these problems, we propose a topic-enhanced capsule network, which contains two main parts: a variational autoencoder and a capsule module, for multi-label emotion detection task.

In this study, we investigate the interplay between non-functional requirements (NFRs) and builds statuses from 1,283 software projects. We found significant differences among NFRs related-builds statuses. Thus, tools can be proposed to improve CI with focus on new ways to prevent failures into CI, specially for efficiency and usability related builds. Also, the time required to put a broken build back on track indicates a bimodal distribution along all NFRs, with higher peaks within a day and lower peaks in six weeks.

The procedure of obtaining knowledge from each aspect (property) of users' opinions is called aspect-based sentiment analysis which consists of three core sub-tasks: aspect extraction, aspect and opinion-words separation, and aspect-level polarity classification. Most successful approaches proposed in this area require a set of primary training or extensive linguistic resources, which makes them relatively costly and time consuming in different languages. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose an unsupervised paradigm for aspect-based sentiment analysis, which is not only simple to use in different languages, but also holistically performs the subtasks for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Our methodology relies on three coarse-grained phases which are partitioned to manifold fine-grained operations. The first phase extracts the prior domain knowledge from dataset through selecting the preliminary polarity lexicon and aspect word sets, as representative of aspects. These two resources, as primitive knowledge, are assigned to an expectation-maximization algorithm to identify the probability of any word based on the aspect and sentiment. To determine the polarity of any aspect in the final phase, the document is firstly broken down to its constituting aspects and the probability of each aspect/polarity based on the document is calculated. To evaluate this method, two datasets in the English and Persian languages are used and the results are compared with various baselines. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines in terms of aspect, opinion-word extraction and aspect-level polarity classification.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8995576","Aspect-based sentiment analysis;aspect extraction;polarity classification;topic modeling","Sentiment analysis;Linguistics;Semantics;Probability;Training;Analytical models;Portable computers","data mining;decision making;expectation-maximisation algorithm;pattern classification;probability;sentiment analysis;unsupervised learning","opinion-words separation;Persian language;English language;probability;expectation-maximization algorithm;preliminary polarity lexicon;fine-grained operations;unsupervised paradigm;user opinion;decision-making process;LISA;language-independent method;aspect-level polarity classification;aspect extraction;aspect-based sentiment analysis","","9","","34","CCBY","12 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Identifying these informative features as keywords from Twitter is challenging, as people use informal language to express their thoughts and feelings. This informality includes acronyms, misspelled words, synonyms, transliteration and ambiguous terms. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to select the keywords frequently used in Twitter that are mostly associated with events of interest such as protests. The volume of these keywords is tracked in real time to identify the events of interest in a binary classification scheme. We use keywords within word-pairs to capture the context. The proposed method is to binarize vectors of daily counts for each word-pair by applying a spike detection temporal filter, then use the Jaccard metric to measure the similarity of the binary vector for each word-pair with the binary vector describing event occurrence. The top n word-pairs are used as features to classify any day to be an event or non-event day. The selected features are tested using multiple classifiers such as Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN and decision trees. They all produced AUC ROC scores up to 0.91 and F1 scores up to 0.79.

Given a document of any domains, the model needs to figure out the sentiments with respect to fine-grained aspects in the documents. Two main challenges exist in this problem. One is to build a robust document modeling across domains; the other is to mine the domain-specific aspects and make use of the sentiment lexicon. In this paper, we propose a novel approach Neural Attentive model for cross-domain Aspect-level sentiment CLassification (NAACL), which leverages the benefits of the supervised deep neural network as well as the unsupervised probabilistic generative model to strengthen the representation learning. NAACL jointly learns two tasks: (i) a domain classifier, working on documents in both the source and target domains to recognize the domain information of input texts and transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. In particular, a weakly supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (wsLDA) is proposed to learn the domain-specific aspect and sentiment lexicon representations that are then used to calculate the aspect/lexicon-aware document representations via a multi-view attention mechanism; (ii) an aspect-level sentiment classifier, sharing the document modeling with the domain classifier. It makes use of the domain classification results and the aspect/sentiment-aware document representations to classify the aspect-level sentiment of the document in domain adaptation scenario. NAACL is evaluated on both English and Chinese datasets with the out-of-domain as well as in-domain setups. Quantitatively, the experiments demonstrate that NAACL has robust superiority over the compared methods in terms of classification accuracy and F1 score. The qualitative evaluation also shows that the proposed model is capable of reasonably paying attention to those words that are important to judge the sentiment polarity of the input text given an aspect.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2019.2897093","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61803249); Shanghai Sailing Program(grant numbers:18YF1407700); Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology Innovation Program for Excellent Young Researchers(grant numbers:Y8G027); CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program(grant numbers:Y84402); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8632754","Aspect-level sentiment classification;domain adaptation;topic modeling;multi-view attention","Adaptation models;Neural networks;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic;Social networking (online);Semantics","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;sentiment analysis;word processing","in-domain setups;domain classification results;aspect-level sentiment classifier;sentiment lexicon representations;weakly supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation model;target domain;source domain;domain information;domain classifier;supervised deep neural network;NAACL;cross-domain Aspect-level sentiment CLassification;neural attentive model;domain-specific aspect;fine-grained aspects;domain adaptation scenario;cross-domain Aspect-level sentiment classification","","7","","63","IEEE","1 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Supervised approaches rely on a dataset with natural language queries annotated with categorizing labels. As the annotation process is manual and requires deep domain knowledge, these approaches are not readily applicable on new datasets. On the other hand, unsupervised approaches overcome the limitation. To date, unsupervised approaches are primarily based on matching keywords, entity relationships, topics and clusters. Keywords and entity relationships ignore the semantic similarity between a query and services. Topics and clusters capture the semantic similarity, but rely on mashups that explicitly capture relationships between services. Again, for new services, the information are not readily available. We propose NL2API, a framework that relies solely on service descriptions for recommending services. NL2API has the benefit of being immediately applicable as a bootstrap recommender for new datasets. To capture relationships among services, NL2API provides different approaches to construct communities where a community represents an abstraction over a group of services. Based on the communities and users' queries, NL2API applies a query matching approach to recommend top-k services. We evaluate NL2API on datasets collected from Programmable Web and API Harmony.

Various activities, such as user location, application usage, user motion, and battery usage have been popular choices to generate behaviors, the soft biometrics, for implicit authentication. Unlike password-based or hard biometric-based authentication, implicit authentication does not require explicit user action or expensive hardware. However, user behaviors can change unpredictably which renders it more challenging to develop systems that depend on them. In addition to dynamic behavior extraction, the proposed implicit authentication system differs from the existing systems in terms of energy efficiency for battery-powered mobile devices. Since implicit authentication systems including the proposed one rely on machine learning, the expensive training process needs be outsourced to the remote server. However, mobile devices may not always have reliable network connections to send real-time data to the server for training. We overcome this limitation by proposing a W-layer, an overlay that provides a practical and energy-efficient solution for implicit authentication on mobile devices. We implemented partially labeled Dirichlet allocation (PLDA) on the server side for more accurate feature extraction, and achieved 93.3 percent precision and 98.6 percent accuracy in the synthetic dataset.

Recent solutions employ representations derived from the sequence profile, obtained by replacing each amino acid of the sequence by the corresponding most probable amino acid in the profile. However, the information contained in the profile could be exploited more deeply, provided that there is a representation able to capture and properly model such crucial evolutionary information. In this paper, we propose a novel profile-based representation for sequences, called soft Ngram. This representation, which extends the traditional Ngram scheme (obtained by grouping N consecutive amino acids), permits considering all of the evolutionary information in the profile: this is achieved by extracting Ngrams from the whole profile, equipping them with a weight directly computed from the corresponding evolutionary frequencies. We illustrate two different approaches to model the proposed representation and to derive a feature vector, which can be effectively used for classification using a support vector machine (SVM). A thorough evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates that the new approach outperforms other Ngram-based methods, and shows very promising results also in comparison with a broader spectrum of techniques.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2016.2595575","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524713","Ngram;sequence profile;topic models","Amino acids;Proteins;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Benchmark testing;Support vector machines;Biological system modeling","biology computing;molecular biophysics;proteins;proteomics","soft Ngram representation;protein remote homology detection;bioinformatics;feature vector;support vector machine;Ngram-based methods","Computational Biology;Proteins;ROC Curve;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Analysis, Protein;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Support Vector Machine","5","","28","IEEE","28 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The nonparametric topic evolution models do not perform very well on short texts due to the data sparsity problem. So in this paper, we propose a nonparametric topic evolution model for short texts.

A multitude of research efforts have been deployed analyzing individual aspects of such cyber-security corpora to create taxonomies, assess vulnerability impact, and even predict future vulnerabilities. However, minimal effort has been committed to analyze cyber-security corpora to explore correlations between vulnerabilities and study the evolution of a vulnerability from its genesis. In this paper, we propose an integrated data mining framework to automatically lay out how vulnerabilities develop over time and detect the evolution of a specific cyber-security threat. We use (1) a Supervised Topical Evolution Model (STEM), which discovers temporal themes from a text corpus and (2) a diffusion-based storytelling technique that sifts through past vulnerability reports to describe how a current threat evolved. The STEM gives a holistic evolution structure of the vulnerabilities, while diffusion-based storytelling provides the precise genealogy of a specific threat. A considerable series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can discover evolutionary patterns in today's most pressing vulnerabilities with a high degree of precision. As case studies, we explore the development of vulnerabilities in certain products, providing a unique insight into the correspondence between seemingly unrelated vulnerabilities and the impact of that correspondence on overall software security.","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622299","cyber-security;vulnerabilities;temporal topic modeling;storytelling","Microsoft Windows;Databases;Market research;Correlation;Software algorithms;Kernel","data mining;security of data;supervised learning;text analysis","national vulnerability database;cyber-security corpora;cyber-security threat;software design;text format;integrated data mining framework;supervised topical evolution model;STEM;text corpus;diffusion-based storytelling technique","","5","","20","","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The upcoming 5G technology is one of the recent victims of misinformation and fake news and has been plagued with misinformation about the effects of its radiation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories linking the cause of the pandemic to 5G technology have resonated with a section of people leading to outcomes such as destructive attacks on 5G towers. The analysis of the social network data can help to understand the nature of the information being spread and identify the commonly occurring themes in the information. The natural language processing (NLP) and the statistical analysis of the social network data can empower policymakers to understand the misinformation being spread and develop targeted strategies to counter the misinformation. In this paper, NLP based analysis of tweets linking COVID-19 to 5G is presented. NLP models including Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), sentiment analysis (SA) and social network analysis (SNA) were applied for the analysis of the tweets and identification of topics. An understanding of the topic frequencies, the inter-relationships between topics and geographical occurrence of the tweets allows identifying agencies and patterns in the spread of misinformation and equips policymakers with knowledge to devise counter-strategies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3039168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9262907","5G conspiracy;corona-5G link;COVID-19;radiation scare;topic modelling;tweet analysis","COVID-19;5G mobile communication;Social networking (online);Pandemics;Coherence;Blogs;Analytical models","5G mobile communication;biomedical communication;diseases;epidemics;information dissemination;sentiment analysis;social networking (online);statistical analysis","5G networks;SNA;social media platforms;COVID-19 pandemic;5G technology;social network data;natural language processing;statistical analysis;NLP based analysis;social network analysis;information dissemination;latent dirichlet allocation;sentiment analysis","","5","","43","CCBY","18 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Over the last few years, the traffic data that we have at our disposal have significantly increased, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation. Most existing travel demand prediction methods mainly focus on capturing recurrent mobility trends that relate to habitual/routine behavior, and on exploiting short-term correlations with recent observation patterns. However, valuable information that is often available in the form of unstructured data is neglected when attempting to improve forecasting results. Particularly, under non-recurrent conditions, such as large events, or incidents, we need much better models. In this paper, we explore time-series data and semantic information combinations using machine learning and deep learning techniques in the context of creating a prediction model that is able to capture in real-time future stressful situations of the studied transportation system. We apply the proposed approaches in event areas in New York using publicly available taxi data. We empirically show that the proposed models are able to significantly reduce the error in the forecasts. The importance of semantic information is highlighted in all presented methods and the final mean absolute error of our prediction is decreased by 23.8% for a three months testing period.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2019.2897341","Seventh Framework Programme(grant numbers:609405 (COFUNDPostdocDTU)); European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship(grant numbers:H2020-MSCA-IF-2016,ID 745673); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8643585","Time series forecasting;taxi demand;special events;semantic information;topic modeling;deep learning;deep Gaussian processes","Public transportation;Predictive models;Urban areas;Deep learning;Internet;Semantics","Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);time series;traffic engineering computing;transportation","semantic information combinations;machine learning;deep learning techniques;transportation system;taxi data;travel demand prediction methods;time-series data;unstructured data;recurrent mobility trends;big data;traffic data;economy","","4","","51","IEEE","17 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing feature representation learning-based approaches try to minimize the difference of latent features between different domains by exact alignment, which is achieved by either one-to-one topic alignment or matrix projection. Exact alignment, however, restricts the representation flexibility and further degrades the model performances on CLSC tasks if the distribution difference between two language domains is large. On the other hand, most previous studies proposed document-level models or ignored sentiment polarities of topics that might lead to insufficient learning of latent features. To solve the abovementioned problems, we propose a coarse alignment mechanism to enhance the model's representation by a group-to-group topic alignment into an aspect-level fine-grained model. First, we propose an unsupervised aspect, opinion, and sentiment unification model (AOS), which trimodels aspects, opinions, and sentiments of reviews from different domains and helps capture more accurate latent feature representation by a coarse alignment mechanism. To further boost AOS, we propose ps-AOS, a partial supervised AOS model, in which labeled source language data help minimize the difference of feature representations between two language domains with the help of logistics regression. Finally, an expectation-maximization framework with Gibbs sampling is then proposed to optimize our model. Extensive experiments on various multilingual product review data sets show that ps-AOS significantly outperforms various kinds of state-of-the-art baselines.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2979225","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1402800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71501003); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2101804); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71531001,71725002,U1636210); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1836206); Project of Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS(grant numbers:2017146); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063641","Coarse alignment;cross-lingual sentiment classification (CLSC);topic model","Data models;Task analysis;Semantics;Learning systems;Bridges;Logistics;Vocabulary","expectation-maximisation algorithm;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis;sentiment analysis;word processing","labeled source language data;latent feature representation;sentiment unification model;aspect-level fine-grained model;group-to-group topic alignment;coarse alignment mechanism;document-level models;distribution difference;CLSC tasks;representation flexibility;exact alignment;latent features;target language;resource-scarce domain;prediction models;leverage rich-labeled resources;cross-lingual sentiment classification;unified model;partial supervised AOS model;ps-AOS","","4","","45","IEEE","10 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rich topological, temporal and spatial information in Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) helps to mine user preference deeply and evokes effectiveness of tourist attraction recommendation. In this paper, a personalized tourist attraction recommendation mechanism is designed in terms of different factors, including user preference, social relationship, location distance and location popularity. Firstly, a large number of check-ins in LBSN are filtered for further geographical space clustering to get real tourist attraction check-ins by DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm. Then, a location-aware LDA model is used to excavate user's latent preference topic distribution and region's latent topic distribution on tourist attractions. After that, these two attributes together with social relationship are used to make user interest scoring function. Furthermore, another two scoring functions are established respectively based on tourist attraction location distance and popularity. At last, a personalized tourist attraction recommendation algorithm is designed to recommend tourist attractions to users, which ranks tourist attractions based on weighted average by combining the above three scores. Experiments are carried out on Foursquare data sets and results show that our method can perform well on recommendation in home city and new city.","","978-1-5386-1482-2","10.1109/CSCWD.2018.8465179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8465179","Travel Attraction;Personalized Recommendation;Location-Based Service;Topic Model","Urban areas;Clustering algorithms;Semantics;Resource management;Computer networks;Social network services;Trajectory","data mining;geographic information systems;mobile computing;pattern clustering;recommender systems;social networking (online);travel industry","Location-time-sociality aware personalized tourist attraction recommendation;LBSN;tourist attraction information;spatial information;Location-Based Social Network;personalized tourist attraction recommendation mechanism;social relationship;location popularity;tourist attraction check-ins;location-aware LDA model;user interest scoring function;tourist attraction location distance;personalized tourist attraction recommendation algorithm;user preference mining;location distance;geographical space clustering;DBSCAN;density based spatial clustering of applications with noise","","4","","15","","16 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we propose a method to infer citizens' political alignment in order to predict elections results. To this end, first we collect 750K tweets posted during 2015 Venezuelan Parliamentary election either inside the Venezuela's bounding box or by its political leaders. Second, we build a dictionary characterizing the political leader's speech applying automated content analysis to our corpus. We show that the automatically generated dictionary is an useful tool to improve the accuracy on political election results prediction tasks. Third, using a data set of 1,000 manually-annotated individuals, we show that a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained on our political dictionary predicts the user political alignment with 87% of accuracy. Finally, using our political dictionary, we design a simple metric to quantify the political lining reflected in a given tweet.

The artifact author must manually read through the reviews and differentiate between true-faults and false-positives before fixing the faults. The time spent in making effective post-inspection decisions (number of true faults and deciding whether to re-inspect) could be spent in doing actual development work. The goal of this research is to automate the validation of inspection reviews, finding common patterns that describe high-quality requirements, identify fault prone requirements pre-inspection, and interrelated requirements to assist fixation of reported faults post-inspection. To accomplish these goals, this research employs various classification approaches, NL processing with semantic analysis and mining solutions from graph theory to requirement reviews and NL requirements.

We extracted topics from these datasets and then observed the trends of these topics from 2012 to 2018. These trends fall into many recognizable patterns. Some trends are stable, often using common words found in mental health conversations. Other trends are increasing or decreasing. In this work, we found that topics with positive words are becoming less frequently used and topics with negative connotations are becoming more frequently used. Other trends display a periodic pattern, like those associated with the school year. One trend demonstrates a sudden shift in conversation possibly due to a change in how the site is administered. We confirm these qualitative observations through quantitative analysis with statistical tests.","2375-9259","978-1-5386-9288-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2018.00107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8637397","Topic Modeling;Suicidal Ideation;Time Series","Market research;Social networking (online);Semantics;Sparse matrices;Diseases;Psychiatry;Public healthcare","medical computing;social networking (online);statistical testing","online mental health discussions;mental illness;widespread public health concern;daily basis;rich dataset;authentic discussions;multiple mental health forums;popular social media;recognizable patterns;common words;mental health conversations;positive words","","3","","29","","10 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But the huge presence of unrelated comments following each post can impact many parts of people engagement as well as the visibility of the actual post. Related comments to a post' s topic usually provide readers more insight into the post content and can attract their attention. On the other hand, unrelated comments distract them from the original topic of the post or disturb them by worthless content and can mislead or impact their opinion. In this paper, we propose an effective framework to measure the similarity of given comments to a post in terms of the content and distinguish the related and unrelated written comments to the actual post. Toward that end, the proposed framework enhances a novel feature engineering by combining a syntactical, topical, and semantical set of features and leveraging word embeddings approach. A machine learning-based classification approach is used to label related and unrelated comments of each post. The proposed framework is evaluated on a dataset of 33,921 comments written under 30 posts from BBC News agency page on Facebook. The evaluation indicates that our model achieves in average the precision of 86% in identifying related and unrelated comments with an improvement of 9.6% in accuracy in comparison with previous work, without relying on the entire article of the posts or external web pages' content related to each post. As a case study, the learned classifier is applied on a bigger dataset of 278,370 comments written under 332 posts and we observed almost 60% of the written comments are not related to the actual posts' content. Investigating the content of both group of related and unrelated comments regarding the topics of their actual posts shows that most of the related comments are objective and they discuss the posts' content in terms of topics whereas unrelated comments usually contain subjective and very general words expressing feedback without any focus on the subject of the posts.","","978-1-7281-2946-4","10.1109/SNAMS.2019.8931726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8931726","Unrelated content;topic modeling;word embeddings;text similarity analysis;social media;Facebook feedback","Feature extraction;Facebook;Semantics;Analytical models;Blogs;Encyclopedias","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;social networking (online);text analysis","content similarity analysis;social media;post content;unrelated written comments;external Web pages;related written comments;machine learning-based classification approach;BBC News agency page;Facebook;word embeddings approach","","3","","26","","16 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In practice, understanding the software system requires investigating the high-level system functionality and mapping it to its low-level implementation, i. e. source code. The implementation of a software system can be captured using a call graph. A call graph represents the system's functions and their interactions at a single level of granularity. While call graphs can facilitate understanding the inner system functionality, developers are still required to manually map the high-level system functionality to its call graph. This manual mapping process is expensive, time-consuming and creates a cognitive gap between the system's highly-level functionality and its implementation. In this paper, we present an innovative approach that can automatically (1) construct and visualize the static call graph for a system written in Python, (2) cluster the execution paths of the call graph into hierarchal abstractions, and (3) label the clusters according to their major functional behaviors. The goal is to bridge the cognitive gap between the high-level system functionality and its call graph, which can further facilitate system comprehension. To validate our approach, we conducted four case studies including code2graph, Detectron, Flask, and Keras. The results demonstrated that our approach is feasible to construct call graphs and hierarchically cluster them into abstraction levels with proper labels.","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622426","static call graph;static analysis;clustering;topic modeling;program comprehension;Python","Tools;Python;Software systems;Task analysis;Visualization;Maintenance engineering","medical computing;pattern clustering;software maintenance","automatic hierarchical clustering;static call graph;program comprehension;software system;high-level system functionality;low-level implementation;call graphs;inner system functionality;system comprehension;code2graph","","3","","41","","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is a challenge to extract topics from short description texts of composite-services, for short texts do not provide sufficient word occurrences. In view of this problem, a multi-description topic based clustering approach for composite-service discovery is proposed. In this approach, descriptions of the component services of each composite-service are combined for topic extraction and modeling. Then, composite-services are clustered based on their topic similarities. Finally, composite-services are discovered from the cluster that is most topic-similar to the service queries.

Previous studies have examined how to extract investors' sentiments captured on social media to enhance stock prediction. However, little work was done to leverage public's emotions captured on social media to predict corporate credit risks. Our research fills the current research gap by developing a new computational method to extract public's emotions embedded in social postings to supplement common financial indicators (e.g., return-on-assets) for predicting corporate credit ratings. Grounded in Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions, the proposed computational framework can automatically extract the distribution of eight basic emotions from textual postings on online social media. In particular, one main contribution of our work is the development of the new emotion latent dirichlet allocation (ELDA) model for textual emotion analysis. In addition, we develop an ensemble learning model with random forest (RF) as the basis classifier to improve the performance of corporate credit rating. Based on the real-world data crawled from Twitter, our experimental results confirm that the proposed ELDA model can effectively and efficiently extract public's emotions from social postings to enhance the prediction of corporate credit ratings. To our best knowledge, this is the first successful research of developing a new computational model of extracting public's emotions from social postings to enhance corporate credit risk prediction.","","978-1-5386-7992-0","10.1109/ICEBE.2018.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8592626","corporate credit rating, emotion analysis, topic model, social media","Social network services;Standards;Feature extraction;Resource management;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Companies","data mining;emotion recognition;financial data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;social networking (online);statistical analysis;stock markets;text analysis","online social media;stock prediction;corporate credit risks;social postings;emotion latent dirichlet allocation model;textual emotion analysis;corporate credit risk prediction;public emotion mining;corporate credit rating enhancement;ensemble learning model;ELDA","","2","","33","IEEE","30 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these issues, this study analyzes online activity associated with events such as this on an ongoing basis and can be provided to local police departments so that they can more effectively monitor information on emerging events and respond appropriately. In this work, we introduce the concept of social pressure to assist human users to identify and track trends that may lead to potentially violent events. We combine existing methods of analyzing social media data for event detection with monitoring of the social pressure that may lead to such events. Our algorithm detects words and phrases appearing on social media that may be of interest due to their pertinence to real-world events or movements. After identifying words and phrases that may correspond to news or events, the social pressure is interpreted from the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic weights and sentiment scores of the tweets over time.

To understand if a Twitter user could exhibit depression over a period of time, we applied techniques in stages to discover words that are negative in expression. Existing methods either use a single step or a data subset, whereas we applied a multi-step approach which allowed us to identify potential users and then discover the words that expressed negativity by these users. We address some Twitter specific characteristics in our research. One of which is that Twitter data can be very large, hence our desire to be able to process the data efficiently. The other is that due to its enforced character limitation, the style of writing makes interpreting and obtaining the semantic meaning of the words more challenging. Results show that the sentiment of these words can be obtained and scored efficiently as the computation on these dataset were narrowed to only these selected users. We also obtained the stress scores which correlated well with negative sentiment expressed in the content. This work shows that by first identifying users and then using methods to discover words can be a very effective technique.","","978-1-7281-4762-8","10.1109/BESC48373.2019.8963550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8963550","Twitter;depression;sentiment;stress;topic model","Economics;Social networking (online);Mood;Computational modeling;Blogs;Semantics;Writing","sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","social networks;negativity;social media message;depressive moods;Twitter user;data subset;multistep approach;Twitter specific characteristics;Twitter data;stress scores;negative sentiment;user identification;word detection;Twitter analysis","","2","","12","","20 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Detecting and tracking topics from social media can help people grasp essential information and facilitate many security-related applications. As social media texts are usually short, traditional topic evolution models built based on LDA or HDP often suffer from the data sparsity problem. Recently proposed topic evolution models are more suitable for short texts, but they need to manually specify topic number which is fixed during different time period. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a nonparametric topic evolution model for social media short texts. We first propose the recurrent semantic dependent Chinese restaurant process (rsdCRP), which is a nonparametric process incorporating word embeddings to capture semantic similarity information. Then we combine rsdCRP with word co-occurrence modeling and build our short-text oriented topic evolution model sdTEM. We carry out experimental studies on Twitter dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to monitor social media topic evolution compared to the baseline methods.","","978-1-5090-6727-5","10.1109/ISI.2017.8004885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8004885","Social Media Analytics;Topic Modeling;Text Mining","Semantics;Social network services;Data models;Adaptation models;Analytical models;Tools;Media","social networking (online);text analysis","social media short texts;recurrent semantic dependent CRP;LDA;HDP;semantic dependent Chinese restaurant process;rsdCRP;semantic similarity information;word co-occurrence modeling;short-text oriented topic evolution model;sdTEM;Twitter dataset","","2","","21","","10 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hierarchical clustering methods produce a hierarchy structure along with the clusters that can be useful for managing item categories and sub-categories, dealing with indirect competition and new item categorization as well. Nevertheless, baseline hierarchical clustering algorithms have high computational cost and memory usage. In this paper we propose an innovative scalable hierarchical clustering framework, which overcomes these limitations. Our work consists of a binary tree construction algorithm that creates a hierarchy of the items using three metrics, a) Identity, b) Similarity and c) Entropy, as well as a branch breaking algorithm which composes the final clusters by applying thresholds to each branch of the tree. The proposed framework is evaluated on the popular MovieLens 20M dataset achieving significant reduction in both memory consumption and computational time over a baseline hierarchical clustering algorithm.","","978-1-5386-5502-3","10.1109/BDCAT.2018.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8606651","Hierarchical item clustering;topic modeling;sequence similarity;sequence identity","Clustering algorithms;Entropy;Measurement;Frequency modulation;Memory management;Clustering methods;Binary trees","data reduction;entropy;Internet;pattern clustering;recommender systems;trees (mathematics)","item clustering;dimensionality reduction;market structure;hierarchical clustering methods;hierarchy structure;binary tree construction algorithm;branch breaking algorithm;hierarchical multimetric framework;item similarities;item categorization;hierarchical clustering framework;recommendations","","2","","16","","10 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We develop the variational models vTSPRA and svTSPRA to improve the time use, and our new approach is capable of processing millions of reviews. We rebuild the generative process, improve the rating regression, solve and present the coordinate-ascent updates of variational parameters, and show the time complexity of each iteration is theoretically linear to the corpus size, and the experiments on Amazon datasets show it converges faster than TSPRA and attains better results given the same amount of time. In addition, we tune svTSPRA into an online algorithm ovTSPRA that can monitor oscillations of sentiment and preference overtime.

While existing domain-dependent text segmentation methods have much better performance than domain-independent methods in most cases, only domain-independent methods are applicable to sparse training content in education scenarios. Our method, unlike other domain-dependent text segmentation methods, doesn't require heavy training on prior documents, but only need to train on the current corpus of documents with topic distributions and word vector representations. Our proposed method develops text boundaries between small text units in three steps. We first calculate input text features via topical distributions (latent Dirichlet allocation) and word embeddings (GloVe). We then calculate similarity values between such textual features and detect distribution changes between the similarities. We finally perform clustering on the similarities and detect sub-topic boundaries via cluster differences. We test our method on two datasets, one from an online education course and one from a popular public dataset - Choi Dataset.

The novelty lies in converting physiological and behavioral signals into meaningful events and utilizing their sequence across multiple modalities to distinguish load levels and types. We evaluated this approach on head-worn sensor data from 24 participants completing four different tasks for recognizing (i) low and high load level for a given task load type, (ii) low and high load level regardless of load type, and (iii) both load level and load type. Findings show that the recognition rate is reasonable in (i), close to chance level in (ii), and well above chance level in (iii) for 8 classes using participant-dependent and -independent schemes. Further, a fusion of the proposed event-based features and conventional continuous features achieved the best or similar performance in most cases.

"SiameseQAT: A Semantic Context-Based Duplicate Bug Report Detection Using Replicated Cluster Information","T. M. Rocha; A. L. D. C.

Different users may create bug reports in a non-standard manner and may report a particular problem using a particular set of words due to stylistic choices and writing patterns. Therefore, the same defect can be reported with very different descriptions, generating non-trivial duplicates. To avoid redundant work for the development team, an expert needs to look at all new reports while trying to label possible duplicates. However, this approach is neither trivial nor scalable and directly impacts bug fix correction time. Recent efforts to find duplicate bug reports tend to focus on deep neural approaches that consider hybrid representations of bug reports, using both structured and unstructured information. Unfortunately, these approaches ignore that a single bug can have multiple previously identified duplicates and, therefore, multiple textual descriptions, titles, and categorical information. In this work, we propose SiameseQAT, a duplicate bug report detection method that considers information on individual bugs as well as information extracted from bug clusters. The SiameseQAT combines context and semantic learning on structured and unstructured features and corpus topic extraction-based features, with a novel loss function called Quintet Loss, which considers the centroid of duplicate clusters and their contextual information. We validated our approach on the well-known open-source software repositories Eclipse, NetBeans, and Open Office, comprised of more than 500 thousand bug reports. We evaluated both the retrieval and classification of duplicates, reporting a Recall@25 mean of 85% for retrieval and 84% AUROC for classification tasks, results that were significantly superior to previous works.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3066283","Samsung Eletrônica da Amazônia Ltd., through the Auspice of the Informatics Law(grant numbers:8.387/91); third-part Icomp/Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), and (ii) Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9380447","Duplicate bug report;deep learning;deep neural networks;semantic context-based;Siamese network;loss function;quintet;triplet;attention mechanism;BERT;MLP;LDA;topic modeling","Computer bugs;Feature extraction;Semantics;Task analysis;Context modeling;Data mining","deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;information retrieval;pattern clustering;program debugging;public domain software;semantic networks;software maintenance","Open Office;NetBeans;Eclipse;open-source software repositories;quintet loss;structured features;unstructured features;context learning;semantic learning;duplicate bug report detection;duplicate clusters;corpus topic extraction-based features;bug clusters;deep neural approaches;duplicate bug reports;bug tracking systems;software development;replicated cluster information;semantic context;SiameseQAT","","1","","56","CCBY","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and novel approach to predict user forwarding behavior. Firstly, we build the feature sets that affect the microblog forwarding, such as interest topic,geographic location, user aggregation coefficient,neighborhood overlap and so on. These features are classified into four categories: user characteristics, microblog features, network structure features, and interactive behavior characteristics. Secondly, we establish a feature selection model based on Filtering and Wrapping for predicting the forwarding behavior of users. The model includes three aspects: (1)ANOVA(Analysis of variance): The value of each feature is analyzed by variance analysis. If the feature variance is small, the feature provides less information. (2) $\chi ^{2}$  test and point-two-column correlation analysis: They filter discrete and continuous features, respectively. (3)Wrapper analysis: In order to solve the strong correlations between the features, we use LVW(Las vagas wrapper) algorithm to analyze the above feature sets, and then obtain the optimal feature combination. Finally, we propose the forwarding prediction model based on AdaBoost(Adaptive boosting) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has the highest precision and F1 score than Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and SVM(Support vector machine), and the F1 score reached 0.885. Among different topics, our proposed AdaBoost prediction model has good recall and F1 scores for different topics.

Based on their expertise, mental health professionals have constructed a formal definition of PTSD. However, even the most assiduous mental health professionals can care for only a small fraction of those suffering from PTSD, limiting their perspective of the disorder. As social networking sites have grown in acceptance, users have begun to express personal thoughts and feelings, such as those related to PTSD. This wealth of content can be viewed as an enormous collective description of PTSD and its related issues. We automatically extract informal latent topics from thousands of social media posts in which users describe their experience with PTSD and compare these topics to the formal description generated by mental health professionals. We then explore the pattern and associations of these topics. Our informal topic discovery evaluation reveals that we can successfully identify meaningful topics in PTSD social media related data. When comparing our topics to the criteria included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), we found that we were able to automatically reproduce many of the criteria.

Moreover, the inner relationships between representations learned by previous model is implicit and can only be explained according to visualization, which means poor interpretability. In this paper, we propose Topic Medical Concept Embedding (TMCE), a generative embedding model to address above two problems. TMCE is able to learn multi-sense representations for a single medical concept, and TMCE can also improve interpretability by modeling relationships between each concept explicitly. In TMCE, multi-sense concept representations are influenced by its contexts and its topics. In addition, dosage information which is ignored by previous work are also utilized in TMCE. A MCMC method is presented to jointly learn the two-layer topic embeddings and multi-sense concept embeddings. Experimental results show that representations learned by TMCE outperforms those learned by other strong baselines by a large margin in a multi-label diagnose classification tasks. Several case studies further show that TMCE can learn medically correct multi-sense representations with better interpretability than other strong baselines.","","978-1-5090-3050-7","10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8217683","representation;multi-sense;topic modeling;context;interpretability","Medical diagnostic imaging;Resource management;Machine learning algorithms;Aspirin;Mathematical model;Heart rate","data visualisation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;medical information systems;pattern classification","topic medical concept embedding;multisense concept representation learning;medical knowledge;representation learning algorithm;visualization;multilabel diagnosis classification;machine learning applications;TMCE;multisense concept embeddings","","1","","7","","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel topic and sentiment matrix factorization model, which leverages both topic and sentiment drawn from the reviews simultaneously. First, we conduct topic analysis and sentiment analysis on reviews using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and a lexicon construction technique, respectively. Second, we combine the user consistency, which is calculated from his/her reviews and ratings, and helpful votes from other users on reviews to obtain a reliability measure to weight the ratings. Third, we integrate the obtained reliability measure and the results of the topic and sentiment analysis of reviews into the matrix factorization framework for prediction.

These expert hackers provide entry-level criminals with tools that allow them to enhance their cybercrime operations significantly. Thus, effectively and efficiently disrupting highly proficient cybercriminals is of a high priority to law enforcement. Such individuals can be found in vast underground forums, though it is particularly challenging to identify and profile individual users. We tackle this problem by combining two analysis methods: text analysis with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Social Network Analysis with centrality measures. In this paper, we use LDA to eliminate around 79% of hacker forum users with very low to no technical skills, while also inferring the forum roles held by the remaining users. Furthermore, we use centrality measures to identify users with hugely popular public posts, including users with very few public posts who receive much attention from their peers. We study various preprocessing methods, wherein we achieve our results by following a series of rigorous preprocessing steps. Our proposed method works towards overcoming current challenges in identifying and interrupting highly proficient cybercriminals.","","978-1-7281-8800-3","10.1109/ISI49825.2020.9280523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9280523","Topic modelling;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Social Network Analysis;Network centrality;Underground forum;Crime as a Service;Digital forensics","Text analysis;Computer hacking;Social networking (online);Current measurement;Tools;Security;Message systems","computer crime;text analysis","service business model;expert hackers;entry-level criminals;cybercrime operations;law enforcement;underground forums;text analysis;latent Dirichlet allocation;centrality measures;hacker forum users;technical skills;forum roles;preprocessing methods;cybercriminals;social network analysis;crime as a service","","1","","28","","8 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One major approach to learn LDA is Gibbs sampling. The basic Collapsed Gibbs Sampling (CGS) algorithm requires O(NZ) computations to learn an LDA model with Z topics from a corpus containing N tokens. Existing approaches that improve the complexity of CGS focus on reducing the factor Z. In this work, we propose a novel and general Sub-Gibbs Sampling (SGS) strategy to improve the Gibbs-Sampling computation by reducing the sample space. This new strategy targets at reducing the factor N by sampling only a subset of the whole corpus. The design of the SGS strategy is based on two properties that we observe: (i) topic distributions of tokens are skewed and (ii) a subset of documents can approximately represent the semantics of the whole corpus. We prove that the SGS strategy can achieve comparable effectiveness (with bounded errors) and significantly reduce the complexity of existing Gibbs sampling algorithms. Extensive experiments on large real-world data sets show that the proposed SGS strategy is much faster than several state-of-the-art fast Gibbs sampling algorithms and the proposed SGS strategy can learn comparable LDA models as other Gibbs sampling algorithms.","2374-8486","978-1-5386-3835-4","10.1109/ICDM.2017.113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8215576","Topic Models;Gibbs Sampling;Sub-sampling","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Semantics;Complexity theory;Partitioning algorithms;Resource management;Computational modeling","Bayes methods;data mining;inference mechanisms;sampling methods;statistical analysis;text analysis","CGS focus;SGS strategy;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Gibbs-sampling computation;LDA model","","1","","15","","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Keyword clustering and TF-IDF are repeatedly applied to the retrieved keywords to further filter out irrelevant words. Coherence values for LSA and LDA are evaluated to determine an adequate number of topics that need to be generated.

Typically, recommendations are based on past user interactions (e.g., movies a user saw, hotels a user booked, etc.). This work in progress paper focuses on news recommender systems. Because of the nature of news (e.g., constantly new items, short item lifetime, etc.), recommendations based on past interactions are especially hard to make. Hence, news recommender systems heavily rely on the actual content of news. While previous work mainly considers one aspect of the content of news articles, we jointly analyse and discuss in this work a given corpora of news articles on three different levels (i.e., document-level, topic-level, and author-level). The overall aim is to set to provide the basis for a comprehensive news recommender system, which reaches beyond accuracy and considers also diversity and serendipity. We demonstrate that relevant information can be extracted out of a given corpora, and differences in author, time, and topic can be shown. Furthermore, the author-level analysis shows that documents can be clustered based on the writing style of authors.

In this paper, we propose a word embedding-based approach to analyze users-centric tweets to observe their behavior evolution in terms of the topics discussed by them over a period of time. We also present a word embedding-based proximity measure to monitor temporal transitions between the topics using five topic evolution events - emergence, persistence, convergence, divergence, and extinction. The proximity between a pair of topics is defined as a function of the content and contextual similarity between their word distributions, wherein the contextual similarity is calculated using word embedding.

Although many innovative techniques have been developed to filter spam reviews and spammers, these techniques could not help users further pick out high-credible information. In this paper, we proposed a machine-learning-based approach to evaluate the credibility of reviewers. Typically, high-credible reviewers are more likely to post reliable reviews. Therefore, our approach can help users discover high-credible information more efficiently. We propose three groups of features that measure reviewer credibility in terms of user behavior, social relationships, and review quality. Then, we learn a classifier with a resampling mechanism to decide whether a user is high-credible or ordinary.

To solve these issues, we proposed a Keyword-guided Topic-oriented CRS model (KGTO), which captures more accurate topic by extracting keywords through the hierarchical attention mechanism, and enriches the contextual information of items by fusing the co-occurrence graph with the knowledge graph. Moreover, a generative module can select words or items supplemented topic information to generate proper responses.

As such, this paper utilizes Stack Exchange Q&A websites to review software engineering ethics and presents a case study that aims to provide a better understanding of the presence of software engineering ethics on three popular Stack Exchange Q&A websites, which are Stack Overflow (SO), Software Engineering (SE), and Project Management (PM). The study analyzes over 2,170 posts, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to better understand what ethic-related topics are discussed. Subsequently, the authors analyzed the popularity and difficulty of each identified topic. The study found that users discuss six ethic-related topics, which are as follows: web scraping, software quality, software security, open-source software usage, team and employers, and software billing. Moreover, the results revealed that software security is the most popular and the most difficult topic. This study highlights ethic-related challenges that are faced by Q&A website users.

Most of the time we end up investing in reading content that we later understand was not of importance to us. Due to the lack of capacity of the human to grasp vast quantities of information, relevant and crisp summaries are always desirable.

Different approaches of clustering, modelling, content generation and summarization are applied to reach the intended goal. This system also eliminates the repetitive content giving savings on time and quantity, thereby making learning more comfortable and effective.

As a proof of concept, syntactic indexing (TF-IDF and BM25) and semantic indexing (Latent Semantic Indexing - LSI and Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA) techniques were evaluated using document collections from two public prosecutors offices. In addition, we evaluate model enrichment with the use of recorded data about the cases, and also with the legal norm citations observed in documents. Baseline document collections sampled from full document collection from two public prosecutors offices were used for model evaluation utilizing Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain (NDCG) as metric. We conclude that there is no significant performance difference between semantic and syntactic indexing techniques. In addition, we observe no significant performance gain with model enrichment.

The quantity of research and scientific publications in EdTech is constantly increasing, and trying to analyze and extract information from a set of research papers is often a very time-consuming task. To make this process easier and solve these limitations, we present Fontana, a framework that can quickly perform trend and social network analysis using any corpus of documents and its metadata. Specifically, the framework can: 1) Discover the latest trends given any corpus of documents, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis and keywords (bibliometric approach); 2) Discover the evolution of the trends previously identified over the years; 3) Discover the primary authors and papers, along with hidden relationships between existing communities. To test its functionality, we evaluated the framework using a corpus of papers from the EdTech research field. We also followed an open science methodology making the entire framework available in Open Science Framework (OSF) easy to access and use. The case study successfully proved the capabilities of the framework, revealing some of the most frequent topics in the area, such as “EDM,” “learning analytics,” or “collaborative learning.” We expect our work to help identifying trends and patterns in the EdTech area, using natural language processing and social network analysis to objectively process large amounts of research.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3163253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745089","EdTech;data mining;bibliometrics;NLP;network analysis;topic modeling","Bibliometrics;Market research;Task analysis;Metadata;Social networking (online);Databases;Network analyzers","computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational technology;groupware;information analysis;meta data;natural language processing;social networking (online)","Open Science Framework;EdTech area;natural language processing;social network analysis;educational technology communities;Fontana Framework;computer-supported collaborative learning;scientific publications;bibliometric approach;EdTech research field;open science methodology","","","","66","CCBY","30 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

CF represents user’s preference as ratings of matrix form. In real systems and services, the percentage of missing ratings (called sparsity) is usually high. Matrix factorization (MF) is an efficient method to estimate missing ratings from a small number of ratings. There is, however, a limit to how well MF can deal with missing ratings. Collaborative topic regression (CTR) is a pioneer model, which uses not only ratings but also document information regarding items and users. CTR is quite effective in extremely high sparsity situations, but its performance may be inferior to that of MF in relatively low sparsity situations. We assume that it is important to select words in the documents based on document frequency according to sparsity. And CTR has several hyperparameters that adjust the influence strength of the ratings and the latent topics extracted from the documents. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the combination of words used in latent topic extraction and hyperparameters under several sparsity levels. These elements are likely to be closely related to each other; hence, it is important to clarify their relationships to leverage CTR. As a result of our experiments, we summarize guidelines for word selection and hyperparameter settings for leveraging CTR according to sparsity.","","978-1-6654-1924-6","10.1109/WIIAT50758.2020.00125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9457698","recommender system;collaborative filtering;matrix factorization;topic model","Collaborative filtering;Collaboration;Information filters;Intelligent agents;Guidelines","collaborative filtering;information filtering;matrix decomposition;recommender systems;regression analysis","latent topic extraction;document frequency;relatively low sparsity situations;extremely high sparsity situations;document information;collaborative topic regression;matrix factorization;missing ratings;matrix form;user;latent topics;collaborative filtering;recommender performance;leveraging CTR;hyperparameter settings;word selection;leverage CTR;sparsity levels","","","","26","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a representation learning model for short texts to tackle this challenge. Our proposed model is based on Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF). Due to the problem lacking word co-occurrences information, it effectively learns the representation model by incorporating the semantic relationship between words generated by unsupervised learning methods. Finally, the NNMF-based model is effectively solved by using a gradient descent-based algorithm. Experimental results on two benchmark data sets, including sentiment140 and 20newsgroups, demonstrate that our proposed approach achieved the improvement of classification accuracy to state-of-the-art topic discovery techniques.","","978-1-7281-2627-2","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2019.00130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8992635","short text;non-negative matrix factorization;topic modeling","","data mining;gradient methods;matrix decomposition;pattern classification;pattern clustering;text analysis;unsupervised learning","short text representation;nonnegative matrix factorization;word semantic;representation learning model;word co-occurrence information;unsupervised learning methods;NNMF-based model","","","","21","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the exponential growth of scientific literature, it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to quickly and effectively identify potential research topics in an interested area to advance their research. This has led to the development of research topic recommendation. In this paper, aiming to explore the potential author-topic relations in depth, we proposed a research topic recommendation methodology based on latent Dirichlet allocation and bipartite network analysis, to predict the inspiring research topics that an author potentially will be interested and working on. A case study on scientific literature in the area of knowledge discovery is then presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the methodology.

One way to understand network is to analyze groups of nodes which share same properties or functions. The task of discovering such groups is known as community detection. The community detection in real-life networks, the majority of which are weighted temporal text networks, is confronted with two main problems - how to model the weight of edges and how to exploit the temporal information. Existing works either ignore the edge weight or utilize it in graph measures like modularity, which lacks scalability. And currently the common-used method involving temporal information is to discretize the time, which leads to series of problems. We are thus motivated to present a new method to encode the edge weight and temporal information. A probabilistic generative model, named Custom Temporal Community Detection (CTCD) is introduced, which views the link between two nodes as a weighted edge with several time stamps. Our model utilizes network, semantic and temporal information simultaneously to extract temporal community affiliations for individual user, influence strength across communities and temporal interested topic in each community. An efficient inference method, which scales linearly, and corresponding parallel implementation are proposed to adapt to large datasets. Through the knowledge extracted by CTCD, we are able to spot the community shift of the individual user, to which little attention has been given, and employ it to track the development of the communities over time. Moreover, experiments on two large-scale weighted temporal text networks show that CTCD gains significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods on a series of tasks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2981487","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773156); Science and Technology Plan Project of Henan Province 192400410046; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9039626","Data mining;social network;temporal community detection;topic model","Image edge detection;Task analysis;Social networking (online);Data mining;Semantics;Clustering algorithms;Integrated circuits","data mining;data structures;graph theory;inference mechanisms;network theory (graphs);parallel processing;text analysis","data mining;parallel implementation;inference method;relational data representation;overlapping community detection;custom temporal community detection;large-scale weighted temporal text networks;community shift;temporal interested topic;temporal community affiliations;semantic information;weighted edge;edge weight;temporal information;real-life networks","","","","41","CCBY","17 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most scientific workflow recommendation focus on mining association patterns between services in historical portfolios, including positive and negative rules, and recommending appropriate workflows based on derived patterns. However, due to the development of social network, several key social interactions are ignored which can enrich implicit associations of items and guide workflow recommendation. To tackle these problems, a Service Social Knowledge Graph (SSKG), including two types of entities service and developer and three types of relations isInk, isDlp and isFrd, is proposed to visually integrate and manage vital information which can facilitate workflows construction. Respectively, isInk shows the data flow between services, isDlp means the relation between a developer and his services and isFrd presents the friend relationships between developers. SSKG supplies indirect relations of services which inferred from isDlp and isFrnd. From SSKG, we extract several positive and negative rules to estimate the feasibility of composing services that the positive rules promote service composition and negative rules hinder the cooperation of services. According to the overall effects of rules, the $A^{*}$ and the Yen's method are used to recommend workflows to users. We have conducted extensive experiments with real-world data. Results indicate that the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method outperform the classical and state-of-the-art methods.","","978-1-7281-8156-1","10.1109/ICBK50248.2020.00040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9194517","Service Composition;Workflow Recommendation;Topic Model;Knowledge Graph","Silicon;Social network services;Knowledge engineering;Geology;Electronic mail;Tools;Computational modeling","data mining;graph theory;knowledge based systems;recommender systems;scientific information systems;social networking (online);Web services;workflow management software","isDlp;positive rules;negative rules;service composition;external Web services;historical portfolios;social network;SSKG;scientific workflow recommendation;association pattern mining;service social knowledge graph;isFrd","","","","16","","11 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A human interacts with a machine with a same expectation as with another person. The key factor for a machine to make a human like interaction is to know the intent of the user before answering the query. Thus intent detection is one of the crucial and important tasks of any interactive system. Moreover detection of intent prior requires labeled data for training under supervision which can be expensive. Though very few papers have been published showing the methods for intent creation, the main focus of this research is to create the intents before its detection. This paper proposes and implements various techniques like K-means, Agglomerative and LDA for creating the labels. After the creation of the clusters as labels, transfer learning technique called zero shot learning is applied for detecting the intents.

Not only affecting the health sector, but the COVID-19 pandemic has also affected other fields, such as economic activities. Issues related to the economy become an essential discussion on Twitter because this sector has close links with other sectors in public activities. It makes twitter relevant as a knowledge extraction medium to identify users' opini comparisons. The contribution of this research is to find the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the comparison of sentiment and emotion in three different locations in Surabaya. Based on the results of emotion detection, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, topics related to economic activities and personal activities were dominated by anger emotion in the ITS campus and the TP mall area. Then, despite the gradual decrease in the intensity of tweets, the dominance of anger emotion tends to be stable. On economics topics, 40% of tweets in the ITS campus area and 84% of tweets in the TP mall area were dominated by anger emotion. Then 37% of tweets in the ITS campus area and 32% tweets in the Tunjungan Plaza mall area based on personal activities were dominated by anger. The economics topic is related to buying-selling and shopping activities, while personal activity is related to lifestyle and daily activities. These results indicate that during the COVID-19 pandemic, anger became the most dominant sentiment related to local economic activity from Twitter users in Surabaya.","","978-1-6654-4059-2","10.1109/ICTS52701.2021.9608519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9608519","COVID-19;economic activities;emotion detection;sentiment analysis;topic modeling","COVID-19;Economics;Sentiment analysis;Analytical models;Social networking (online);Pandemics;Blogs","emotion recognition;epidemics;marketing data processing;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","COVID-19 pandemic;personal activity;anger emotion;TP mall area;tweets;ITS campus area;local economic activity;COVID-19 effect;Twitter texts;public activities;sentiment analysis;buying-selling;shopping activities;Surabaya;knowledge extraction medium;Tunjungan Plaza mall area","","","","19","IEEE","23 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve comprehensive search results, users often relax initially restrictive search formula by adding synonyms and expressions similar to the search words with operator OR, and/or replacing AND with OR operations. However, it is difficult to anticipate all the terms that authors of relevant papers might have used. In addition, the replacement of AND with OR in search phrases can return a large number of unrelated papers. To overcome these issues, we propose a research paper search method based on topic analysis, which uses Boolean search based on the topics assigned to the search words in the search formula and the abstracts that contain any search word. Our method considers synonyms and expressions similar to the search words, which a user might not anticipate, while limiting the number of papers unrelated to the information need in the search result. To investigate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments using the NTCIR-1 and 2 datasets, and confirmed that our method shows a reduction effect on unrelated papers, while maintaining high coverage.","","978-1-5386-1981-0","10.1109/IALP.2017.8300606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8300606","topic model;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;support for high coverage search;search precision;search recall","Software;Resource management;Data preprocessing;Data mining;Information retrieval","information retrieval;logic gates;search problems;text analysis","topic analysis techniques;academic paper search;synonyms;search word;search phrases;research paper search method;Boolean search;restrictive search formula;NTCIR-1 datasets;NTCIR-2 datasets","","","","8","","22 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have developed a powerful dual triggered correspondence topic (DTCT)model for MeSH annotated articles. In our model, two types of data are assumed to be generated by the same latent topic factors and words in abstracts and titles serve as descriptions of the other type, MeSH terms. Our model allows the generation of MeSHs in abstracts to be triggered either by general document topics or by document-specific “special” word distributions in a probabilistic manner, allowing for a trade-off between the benefits of topic-based abstraction and specific word matching. In order to relax the topic influences of non-topical words or domain-frequent words in text description, we integrated the discriminative feature of Okapi BM25 into word sampling probability. This allows the model to choose keywords, which stand out from others, in order to generate MeSH terms. We further incorporate prior knowledge about relations between word and MeSH in DTCT with phi-coefficient to improve topic coherence. We demonstrated the model's usefulness in automatic MeSH annotation. Our model obtained 0.62 F-score 150,00 MEDLINE test set and showed a strength in recall rate.

Hazards are extracted from narrative data in the ICS-209-PLUS based on a framework previously developed by the authors, using natural language processing. Metrics examined for each hazard include operational time to occurrence, rate of occurrence, frequency, and severity. Primary results include a taxonomy of hazards present in the data set with relevant quantitative metrics. The most frequent hazards identified are environmental and include hazardous terrain. Most hazards occur on average between 35-55% containment. Incidents with hazards tend to have a higher average severity score when compared to the average score for all incidents. Time series of the metrics and relevant predictors, including fire characteristics, fire intensity, and operations, are created to facilitate further analysis. Secondary results used to determine which factors best predict hazard frequency include a correlation matrix and regression analysis.

Word2vec word embedding is highly demanded in these days as it can capture the semantic similarity but it does not bother the context and it effects the clustering performance. In this paper, Sentence-BERT (Sentence Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) embedding is used in the vector space representation of services so that with the semantic meaning, context of the features can be also analyzed and services can be efficiently mapped in vector space. To analyze the performance of embedding, K-Means clustering is applied and results are compared with the different state-of-art techniques based on standard evaluation measures.

Both the research community and industry believe that it will exert huge impact on human-computer interaction, and specifically, the IR/RecSys community has begun to explore Conversational Recommendation. In real-life scenarios, such systems are often urgently needed in helping users accomplishing different tasks under various situations. However, existing works still face several shortcomings: (1) Most efforts are largely confined in single task setting. They fall short of hands in handling tasks across domains. (2) Aside from soliciting user preference from dialogue history, a conversational recommender naturally has access to the back-end data structure which should be fully leveraged to yield good recommendations. In this paper, we thus present a Topic-guided Conversational Recommender (TCR) which is specifically designed for the multi-domain setting. It augments the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models with a neural latent topic component to better guide the response generation. To better leverage the dialogue history and the back-end data structure, we adopt a graph convolutional network (GCN) to model the relationships between different recommendation candidates while also capture the match between candidates and the dialogue history. We then seamlessly combine these two parts with the idea of pointer networks. We perform extensive evaluation on a large-scale task-oriented multi-domain dialogue dataset and the results show that our method achieves superior performance as compared to a wide range of baselines.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.3008563","National Research Foundation Singapore; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9138776","Conversational recommendation;topic modeling;graph convolutional networks","Task analysis;History;Databases;Industries;Human computer interaction;Data structures;Google","","","","","","48","IEEE","10 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the first model, we further propose an efficient Document weight and Tag weight-LDA model(DTw-LDA), which fused multi-modal data network. To further improve the clustering accuracy, the model constructs the network for describing text and tag respectively, and then merges the two networks to generate web service network clustered.

We find that merely using the available taxonomy for this task is ineffective; hence we must consider the entire text content. We recommend five high-level categories (Root cause, Impact, Mitigation, Politics or Policy, Others) and assemble ClimateTweets, a dataset with category and polarity labels.

In big companies like Tencent, we routinely spend thousands of hours searching for potential candidates through internal and external recruiting platforms every day, which is tedious and passive. Besides, the traditional job descriptions are difficult to cover various hiring scenarios with surging diversified and personalized needs. To this end, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network for active resume recommendation without dependence on job requirements. The key idea is to model latent preferences of recruiters by learning interactions of multi-field features with convolutional neural network. Based on real behavior data generated by the internal recruiting website, the experimental results show that our model improves resume click-through rate against a series of state-of-the-art methods. In this way, we find an effective approach to lower the time budgets for our recruiters.","","978-1-6654-1882-9","10.1109/ISAS49493.2020.9378849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9378849","Click-through Rate Prediction;Feature Interaction;Convolutional Neural Network;Resume Topic Model","Resumes;Semantics;Neural networks;Predictive models;Data models;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis","business data processing;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);Internet;recruitment;Web sites","convolutional neural network;resume-job matching;recruitment chain;end-to-end deep neural network;multifield features;internal recruiting website;internal recruiting platforms;external recruiting platforms;resume recommendation","","","","23","","22 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Method: Given the unique characteristics of Web content, we adapted the traditional Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology in EBSE, and conducted a review case study in the deep learning domain. Results: Our study selected four different search sources and captured 5082 ""deep learning""-relevant Web documents. After a set of thematic synthesis steps ranging from keyword identification to brainstorming, the collected raw data were eventually evolved into a mind map of six semantic topics. Conclusions: We confirm that Web content can provide valuable information as supplementary evidence in EBSE.

To this end, this article aims to investigate the problem that whether there exists distinct viewing patterns among the neighborhoods of a large-scale city. To achieve this, we need to address several challenges including unknown of patterns profiles, complicate urban neighborhoods, and comprehensive viewing features. The contributions of this article include two aspects. First, we design a framework to automatically identify geographical video viewing patterns in urban neighborhoods. Second, by using a dataset of two months real video requests in Shanghai collected from one major ISP of China, we make a rigorous analysis of video viewing patterns in Shanghai. Our study reveals the following important observations. First, there exists four prevalent and distinct patterns of video access behavior in urban neighborhoods, which are corresponding to four different geographical contexts: downtown residential, office, suburb residential and hybrid regions. Second, there exists significant features that distinguish different patterns, e.g., the probabilities of viewing TV plays at midnight, and viewing cartoons at weekends can distinguish the two viewing patterns corresponding to downtown and suburb regions.","2332-7790","","10.1109/TBDATA.2021.3055860","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFA0711403); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1936217,61971267,61972223,61941117,61861136003); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:L182038); Beijing National Research Center For Information Science And Technology(grant numbers:20031887521); Tsinghua University; Tencent Joint Laboratory for Internet Innovation Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9343751","LDA;geographical behavior;video access;topic modeling","Streaming media;TV;Urban areas;Internet;Big Data;Roads;Web and internet services","geographic information systems;Internet;video retrieval","geographical video viewing patterns;urban neighborhoods;video accounts;geographical viewing patterns;Internet ecosystems;coarse-grain scales;urban-scale geographical patterns;distinct viewing patterns;large-scale city;patterns profiles;comprehensive viewing features;prevalent patterns;distinct patterns;video access behavior;geographical contexts;real video requests","","","","27","IEEE","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence automatic generation of FAQs is a necessity. Automatic generation of FAQs require effective categorization of emails which is challenging since the emails are written by different people with heterogenous cognition levels. In this paper, we propose a framework using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and k-means that groups emails into clusters which can be used for FAQ generation. The proposed framework determines not only the broad topic under which the emails have to be tagged but also categorizes the emails into clusters with similar sub contents. The number of clusters was determined by the elbow method whereas the number of topics was fixed by calculating the percentage of relevant topics. The average Silhouette coefficient score of the resulting clusters was found to be 0.52 indicating reasonably good clusters. Also, the Silhouette coefficient score of the proposed method increased by 36.82 % compared to k-means.","","978-1-5386-7266-2","10.1109/IEMCON.2018.8614894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8614894","Email mining;Email categorization;Email Clustering;FAQ generation;NMF;k-means;Email topic modelling","Electronic mail;Clustering algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Manuals;Dimensionality reduction;Tag clouds;Computer science","electronic mail;matrix decomposition;pattern clustering","FAQs automatic generation;non-negative matrix factorization;NMF;k-means;email clustering;Silhouette coefficient score;groups emails;enquiry emails;email repositories","","","","16","","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These low-dimensional and dense feature vectors of text documents capture semantic similarities better than traditional methods. However, the underlying optimization problem is non-convex and usually solved using stochastic gradient descent. Hence solutions are most-likely sub-optimal and not reproducible, as they are the result of a randomized algorithm. We present an alternative formulation for learning low-rank representations based on convex optimization. Instead of explicitly learning low-dimensional features, we compute a low-rank representation implicitly by regularizing full-dimensional solutions. Our approach uses the weighted nuclear norm, a regularizer that penalizes singular values of matrices. We optimize the regularized objective using accelerated proximal gradient descent. We apply the approach to learn embeddings of documents. These embeddings are guaranteed to converge to a global optimum in a deterministic manner. We show that our convex approach outperforms traditional convex approaches in a numerical study. Furthermore we demonstrate that the embeddings are useful for detecting similarities on a standard dataset. Then we apply our approach in an interdisciplinary research project to detect topics in religious online discussions. The topic descriptions obtained from a clustering of embeddings are coherent and insightful. In comparison to existing approaches, they are also reproducible. An earlier version of this work stated, that the weighted nuclear norm is a convex regularizer. This is wrong - the weighted nuclear norm is non-convex, even though the name falsely suggests that it is a matrix norm.","","978-1-5090-5004-8","10.1109/DSAA.2017.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8259760","embedding learning;natural language processing;convex optimization;low-rank;regularization;digital humanities;topic modelling;text clustering","Optimization;Data models;Acceleration;Training;Singular value decomposition;Semantics;Stochastic processes","convex programming;data structures;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;stochastic processes;text analysis","accelerated proximal gradient descent;convex regularizer;weighted nuclear norm regularization;stochastic gradient descent;low-rank representation;convex optimization;low-dimensional features;full-dimensional solutions;feature vectors;text documents;low-rank document embeddings learning;semantic similarities","","","","34","","18 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Two Datasets of Questions and Answers for Studying the Development of Cross-Platform Mobile Applications using Xamarin Framework","M.

Several frameworks have been proposed to simplify the development of cross-platform mobile applications and, therefore, to reduce development and maintenance costs. Between them, cross-compiler mobile development frameworks, such as Xamarin from Microsoft, transform the application's code written in intermediate (aka non-native) language to native code for each target platform (Android, iOS). However, to our best knowledge, there is not much research about the advantages and disadvantages of the use of those frameworks during the development and maintenance phases of mobile applications. The objective of this paper is to present two datasets of questions and answers (Q&A) related to the development of mobile applications using Xamarin. Our datasets have 85,908 questions mined from the Xamarin Forum and 44,434 from Stack Overflow. To show their usefulness, we present two experiments. First, we replicate a study for discovering the main discussion topics of Xamarin development present in the two datasets using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and we compare them with topics previously reported about mobile development. Between the main topics discovered from those questions, we found that some of them are exclusively related to Xamarin and Microsoft technologies such as the design pattern 'MVVM'. Secondly, we aim at improving the official Xamarin documentation, which does not provide a complete description of the error codes that the Xamarin platform throws during development. We use our datasets of Q&A for complementing the error codes with information mined from accepted answers. We could complement the documentation of 23,9% of the error codes.","","978-1-7281-3395-9","10.1109/MOBILESoft.2019.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8816909","mobile;xamarin;cross platform mobile applications;mobile development;LDA;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Stack Overflow;Mining Software Repositories;Questions and Answers;Android;Documentation;topic modeling","Mobile applications;Documentation;Maintenance engineering;Libraries;Facebook;Resource management;Data mining","data mining;mobile computing;program compilers","Xamarin platform;cross-platform mobile application;cross-compiler mobile development frameworks;stack overflow;error codes;information mining;MVVM;LDA;latent Dirichlet Allocation;Xamarin Forum;Microsoft;question and answer dataset","","","","55","","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We first collect and preprocess profile data from static and dynamic aspects of multi-source data, and then categorize multi-source data topics and emotions. Next, we attempt to construct the profile from four aspects: fundamental characteristic, behavior characteristic, value characteristic and situation characteristic, to explore the correlation among these characteristics. Finally, PFCA is verified by the outcomes of the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections, and is evaluated by relevant experts, which proves that PFCA is relatively effective and efficient to profile high influencers.

Such time varying topics may include beneficial information that could be used for various decision making by general public as well as governmental organization. Especially for the recent pandemic of COVID-19, extraction and visualization of the changing needs of people might help them making some better countermeasures. In this study, COVID-19 related tweets have been collected and analyzed in units of time (hour, day and month) by means of various clustering models to visualize the dynamic changes of topics with time.

This means that any fault or mistake in the requirements definition will negatively affect the whole process of software development and consequently affect the cost, time, and effort of the developers and users. Traditionally, the process of requirement elicitation and categorization was done manually and based on the experience of the developers. However, a lot of problem came up because of the absence of automatic approaches. This paper presents a novel approach to improve the process of software requirements classification and mapping. An Information Retrieval (IR) method, namely Latent Drichelt Allocation (LDA) will be used for classification process. A corpus of software requirements also will be built to be used as input space for LDA algorithm. Typically, each requirement will have a corresponding document in the corpus. We conducted two distinct experiments. The first one is to extract the topics of software requirements, and the second one is for mapping and linking any new requirement to the most existing relevant requirements. The results showed that the proposed approach overwhelmed the state-of-art approaches.","","978-1-5386-7500-7","10.1109/MCSI.2018.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8769792","information retrieval;software requirement;topic modeling;software classification","Software engineering;Information retrieval;Software algorithms;Software quality;Classification algorithms;Stakeholders","formal specification;information retrieval;pattern classification;systems analysis","software requirements classification;software engineering;requirements elicitation;requirements definition;software development;requirement elicitation;classification process;information retrieval method;information retrieval-based solution;requirements specification;requirement categorization;latent Dirichlet allocation;LDA algorithm;software requirements mapping","","","","30","","25 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular to the influenza vaccine, studies on the public opinion and views is ongoing. Social media platforms like Twitter help us to leverage thoughts and attitudes related to the flu vaccine. The data set used for our analysis contained tweets related to vaccines which were collected using vaccine-related keywords over a period of twelve months from February, 2018 to January, 2019. Out of these tweets, we filtered out the tweets specific to the flu vaccine and generated our corpus for further study. By using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified eighteen topics comprising six major themes which best represented our corpus. In this paper, we discuss these six themes and subsequently analyze the trend observed in these themes over a period of twelve months.

This demands the need for an efficient temporal recommender system that takes into account the drifting interests of users too. This study addresses this major challenge and analyses the authors' interests based on similar authors' interests and their own long-term and short-term interests. The proposed model extends the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to capture the temporal aspects and utilizes latent semantic analysis (LSA) method along with the word-net feature to incorporate the semantic understanding of the topics with time. The model is implemented on a real NIPS dataset to a collection of 2000 conference papers.

We infer the functions of each region using the proposed model, which regards a region as a document, a function as a topic, categories of POIs and check-in frequency as words. As a result, a region is represented by a distribution of functions, and a function is represented by the distribution of POI categories. We further identify the intensity to illustrate that our method considers both the spatial distance and check-in frequency. We evaluate our method by using a large scale dataset, consisting of two user check-in records that occurred in Los Angeles and Lower Manhattan.

LCSD aims to democratize application development to software practitioners with diverse backgrounds. Given that LCSD is relatively a new paradigm, it is vital to learn about the challenges developers face during their adoption of LCSD platforms. The online developer forum, Stack Overflow (SO), is popular among software developers to ask for solutions to their technical problems. We observe a growing body of posts in SO with discussions of LCSD platforms. In this paper, we present an empirical study of around 5K SO posts (questions + accepted answers) that contain discussions of nine popular LCSD platforms. We apply topic modeling on the posts to determine the types of topics discussed. We find 13 topics related to LCSD in SO. The 13 topics are grouped into four categories: Customization, Platform Adoption, Database Management, and Third-Party Integration. More than 40% of the questions are about customization, i.e., developers frequently face challenges with customizing user interfaces or services offered by LCSD platforms. The topic ""Dynamic Event Handling"" under the ""Customization"" category is the most popular (in terms of average view counts per question of the topic) as well as the most difficult. It means that developers frequently search for customization solutions such as how to attach dynamic events to a form in low-code UI, yet most (75.9%) of their questions remain without an accepted answer. We manually label 900 questions from the posts to determine the prevalence of the topics’ challenges across LCSD phases. We find that most of the questions are related to the development phase, and low-code developers also face challenges with automated testing. Our study findings offer implications for low-code practitioners, platform providers, educators, and researchers.","2574-3864","978-1-7281-8710-5","10.1109/MSR52588.2021.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463132","Low-Code;Issue;Challenge;Empirical Study","Visualization;Databases;Tutorials;Documentation;User interfaces;Software;Stakeholders","graphical user interfaces;program testing;question answering (information retrieval);software engineering","low-code software development challenges;source code;interactive graphical interfaces;rapid application development;software practitioners;online developer forum;software developers;topic modeling;platform adoption;user interfaces;customization category;low-code UI;low-code developers;low-code practitioners;LCSD platforms;Stack Overflow;database management;third-party integration;dynamic event handling;automated testing","","3","","63","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For news, chatting, entertainment, and other reasons, the majority of people are linked to social media. On social media, misinformation, false data, and conspiracy theories might rapidly spread. A “trending subject” or simply a “trend” on Twitter, for example, is a term, phrase, or topic that receives more attention than others. Retweets help to increase the number of people who see a tweet. Fresh tweets with hashtags related to a trending topic are added to a list of trending tweets to boost the trend’s popularity. A classifier employing topic modelling and deep neural networks is established to determine whether these retweets are genuine or related. Deep learning techniques have recently been observed to be useful in the field of natural language processing.

This paper proposes a conversational ASR model which explicitly learns conversation-level characteristics under the prevalent end-to-end neural framework. The highlights of the proposed model are twofold. First, a latent variational module (LVM) is attached to a conformer-based encoder-decoder ASR backbone to learn role preference and topical coherence. Second, a topic model is specifically adopted to bias the outputs of the decoder to words in the predicted topics.

Recently, with accumulation of users and contents, much concern has arisen over the efficiency and answer quality of CQA services. To address this problem, question routing has been proposed which aims at routing new questions to suitable answerers, who have both high possibility and high ability to answer the questions. In this paper, we formulate question routing as a multi-objective ranking problem, and present a multi-objective learning-to-rank approach for question routing (MLQR), which can simultaneously optimize the answering possibility and answer quality of routed users. In MLQR, realizing that questions are relatively short and usually attached with tags, we first propose a tagword topic model (TTM) to derive topical representations of questions. Based on TTM, we then develop features for each question-user pair, which are captured at both platform level and thread level. In particular, the platform-level features summarize the information of a user from his/her history posts in the CQA platform, while the thread-level features model the pairwise competitions of a user with others in his/her answered threads. Finally, we extend a state-of-the-art learning-to-rank algorithm for training a multi-objective ranking model. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that our MLQR can outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of both answering possibility and answer quality.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2017.2696008","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61502047); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7904676","Community question answering services;question routing;multiple-objective optimization","Routing;Training;Feature extraction;Knowledge discovery;Optimization;History;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;question answering (information retrieval)","multiobjective optimization approach;community question answering services;CQA services;multiobjective ranking problem;multiobjective learning-to-rank approach for question routing;MLQR;tagword topic model;TTM;platform-level features;thread-level features","","14","","34","IEEE","19 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They have become more popular because of their high graphical and pictorial content, delivered by experts in the subjects and convenient for learning at anytime and anywhere. But sometimes, students may not be able to go through the course content due to shortage of time. Video transcript summarizer has got a lot scope in this situation. It highlights the important topics from the video. The idea of summarizing the videos can be extended to online courses videos. This will help students save a lot of time as they can understand the gist of the class within less time without actually watching the video and by just going through the summary. Our system focuses on the development of a module using Natural Language Processing with python to summarize an online class video. The methodology adopted in this project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Gensim to obtain the summary of video of online course. The model takes URL of a video from user as input. We have implemented summarization process with the help of two algorithms. TF-IDF is an information retrieval algorithm which uses frequency of a term and its inverse document frequency. Gensim is a NLP package that deals with topic modeling. The model also gives the flexibility to the user to decide on as to what percentage of summary is needed compared to the original lecture. The summarization technique is a subjective process. We have incorporated two prominent methods. One is cosine similarity and the other one is ROUGE score. The former does not require human generated summary for reference, whereas latter requires it. The efficiency obtained using Cosine similarity is greater than 90% in both the cases: TF-IDF and Gensim. The efficiency obtained in case of ROUGE score is in between 40-50%.","","978-1-6654-0610-9","10.1109/CSITSS54238.2021.9683609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9683609","Natural Language Processing;Summarizer;TF-IDF;Gensim;Cosine Similarity;ROUGE","Measurement;Uniform resource locators;Computational modeling;Conferences;Education;Closed captioning;Information retrieval","computer aided instruction;educational courses;information retrieval;natural language processing;text analysis;video signal processing","online course;online education;quality education;high graphical content;pictorial content;course content;video transcript summarizer;courses videos;help students;online class video;Natural Language Processing algorithms;Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency;TF-IDF;Gensim;summarization process;information retrieval algorithm;topic modeling;summarization technique;subjective process;human generated summary","","","","14","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As datasets grow in size for applications such as topic modeling, recommender systems and internet search queries, there is a need for scalable implementations of pattern analysis algorithms require manual tuning on specialized hardware and methods to parallelize individual learning algorithms on a cluster on a cluster of machines. Practically, MapReduce provides an active device for dripping huge amount of data glitches. But then again, beyond that, MapReduce is vital in how it has changed the way of organization computations at a enormous scale. MapReduce characterizes the first widely accepted step away procedure of von Neumann prototype, which is called bridging model. A Bridging is a conceptual bridge between the physical execution of a hardware and software which has to be executed on that machine. Planning a data through nonlinear function into a appropriate characteristics space allows the use of the similar tools for finding nonlinear patterns. Kernels can make it feasible to use multi-dimensional feature space. The in detailed computation of the feature mapping are avoided. The proposed model of MapReduce Pattern design is done with Hadoop cluster. Algorithm of pattern analysis will take finite sample data from source and pattern may be anything like text, audio, video files. But here only text files are considered. The output of a detected regularity or pattern function will be displayed. The main three features such as efficiency, robustness and stability are expected to expose. The performance of an algorithm to noise in the training examples is inferred by computational efficiency. Summarization kernel function helps to find top view by summing data and grouping data.

(1) Will learning behavior promote tacit coordination in route choice games? (2) Which learning model can best account for these choices/behaviors? To answer the first question, we choose a set of learning models and conduct extensive simulations to determine their success in accounting for major behavioral patterns. To answer the second question, we compare these models to one another by competitively testing their predictions on four different datasets. Although all the selected models account reasonably well for the slow convergence of the mean route choice to equilibrium, they account only moderately well for the mean frequencies of the round-to-round switches from one route to another and fail to appropriately account for substantial individual differences.

Our method leverages probabilistic polylingual topic models based on visual attributes to discover a set of latent style factors. Given a collection of unlabeled fashion images, our approach mines for the latent styles, then summarizes outfits by how they mix those styles.

These have been the subject of numerous investigations; however, cybernetic attacks of similar nature as grooming have been excluded from these studies. In the last decade, various efforts have been made to understand the structure and approach of grooming from the field of computer science with the use of computational learning algorithms. Nevertheless, these studies are not aligned with information security. In this work, the study of grooming is formalized as a social engineering attack, contrasting its stages or phases with life cycles associated with APTs. To achieve this goal, we use a database of real cyber-pedophile chats; this information was refined and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling was applied to determine the stages of the attack. Once the number of stages was determined, we proceed to give them a linguistic context, and with the use of machine learning, a linear model was trained to obtain 97.6% of training accuracy.

This data first needs to be structured as a knowledge base to facilitate tasks such query, search, re-use, sharing, keeping information current, question answering (Q&A), prediction, disambiguation and summarization. Structuring through topic models, database base systems and taxonomies have been tried but these tend to be domain specific and limited in scalability to the level of diverse unstructured data available. Knowledge representation to create knowledge bases can be done through linking data as used in applications such as LinkedIn, Facebook, BabelNet, Google Knowledge Graph, among others. This essentially forms a semantic structure also called a semantic network (SN). The automatic generation of these structures is a problem largely unresolved. This paper concentrates on development of a model that uses machine learning to automatically generate semantic networks from web data. SNs are an important component in the development of applications that support semantic search, Q&A, information retrieval among others.

Our model successfully groups morbidities based on their correlation, and reveals the temporal evolution of these groups from 1999 to 2014. This result is validated by existing literature, and provides a novel view that enables clinical practitioners to make more accurate healthcare decisions, and public health policymakers to make better policy.","","978-1-5090-4179-4","10.1109/BHI.2017.7897234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7897234","","Coherence;Heart;Public healthcare;Market research;Cancer;Neoplasms","biology computing;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis","death;United States;AD 1999 to 2014;statistical methods;clinical research;public health policy making;temporal evolution;unsupervised machine learning method;topic model","","3","","13","","13 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The edge computing service features chatbot-based web interface that handles a given COVID-19 publication dataset using two recommender system modules: (i) evidence-based filtering that observes domain specific topics across the literature and classifies the filtered information according to a clinical category, and (ii) social filtering that allows diverse experts with similar objectives to collaborate via a “social plane” to jointly find answers to critical clinical questions to fight the pandemic. We compare the Domain-specific Topic Model (DSTM) used in our evidence-based filtering with state-of-the-art models considering the CORD-19 dataset (a COVID-19 publication archive) and show improved generalization effectiveness as well as knowledge pattern query effectiveness.

To better appreciate peoples’ opinions and concerns with regards to the socio-economic conditions of addiction, mental health, unemployment and immigration, we collect data for a period of approximately 3 months in the beginning of the pandemic. We analyze the term and co-occurrence frequencies to identify the most commonly occurring words and bigrams in the discussion for each of the four categories. We conduct semantic role labeling to determine the action words in each category and then adopt a LSTM-based dependency parsing model to identify the main nouns linked with these action words. We then adopt a seeded topic modeling approach to automatically identify the main topics of discussion in each category. We finally conclude with a sentiment analysis of the tweets in each category to determine the overall sentiment associated with each category. Our fine-grained linguistic study unearths the difficulties experienced by the people (e.g., action verb need associated with nouns such as aid and assistance in the unemployment category). We also observe that the overall sentiment in the tweets is negative, driven by people experiencing the pains of job loss, deportation, and the difficulty in accessing programs and treatments related to addiction. Our analysis highlights the main challenges experienced by the people during the start of the COVID-19 crisis and lays the foundation for recognizing and developing the most pertinent public and social policies so as to minimize peoples’ suffering in case of a future pandemic.","2693-8340","978-1-6654-1252-0","10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9556265","","COVID-19;Sentiment analysis;Pandemics;Social networking (online);Pain;Semantics;Mental health","computational linguistics;diseases;epidemics;natural language processing;sentiment analysis;social networking (online);socio-economic effects","action words;sentiment analysis;unemployment category;addiction;COVID-19 crisis;future pandemic;societal disruption;user tweets;linguistic analysis;social disruption;economic disruption;COVID-19 pandemic;socio-economic conditions;immigration;co-occurrence frequencies;bigrams;semantic role labeling;action verb;seeded topic modeling;fine-grained linguistic","","2","","27","IEEE","8 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing POI recommender systems usually learn latent vectors to represent both consumers and POIs from historical check-ins and make recommendations under the spatiotemporal constraints. However, we argue that the existing works still suffer from the challenges of explaining consumers complicated check-in actions. In this paper, we first explore the interpretability of recommendations from the POI aspect, i.e., for a specific POI, its function usually changes over time, so representing a POI with a single fixed latent vector is not sufficient to describe POIs dynamic function. Besides, check-in actions to a POI is also affected by the zone it belongs to. In other words, the zone's embedding learned from POI distributions, road segments, and historical check-ins could be jointly utilized to enhance the accuracy of POI recommendations. Along this line, we propose a Time-dependent Zone-enhanced POI embedding model (ToP), a recommender system that integrates knowledge graph and topic model to introduce the spatiotemporal effects into POI embeddings for strengthening interpretability of recommendation. Specifically, ToP learns multiple latent vectors for a POI in different time to capture its dynamic functions. Jointly combining these vectors with zones representations, ToP enhances the spatiotemporal interpretability of POI recommendations. With this hybrid architecture, some existing POI recommender systems can be treated as special cases of ToP. Extensive experiments on real-world Changchun city datasets demonstrate that ToP not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of common metrics, but also provides more insights for consumers POI check-in actions.","2641-9874","978-1-6654-0325-2","10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488726","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Technology Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488726","Recommender systems;knowledge graph;POI recommendation;interpretability","Measurement;Industries;Roads;Conferences;Urban areas;Computer architecture;Spatiotemporal phenomena","learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems;semantic networks;social networking (online);vectors","points-of-interest recommendation;latent vector;POIs dynamic function;POI distributions;POI recommendations;time-dependent zone-enhanced points-of-interest embedding-based explainable recommender system;check-in actions;ToP;knowledge graph;topic model","","1","","30","","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deeper meanings of critical enablers are investigated along two paths: leadership and management for firms with high or low sustainability disclosure scores. For the former, our empirical models show that five Asian firms place emphasis on risk assessment tools. A deeper analysis shows that top two tools are WBCSD Global Water Tool and internal company knowledge. However, for the management group, four firms from Brazil, USA, and South Africa recognize the importance of “risk and business processes.” From a deeper analysis, there appears to be no consensus on which risk drivers are the most important. Generally, the relevance and faithful representation of text entries appear to be lower in the management than the leadership group.

First, short texts do not always observe the syntax of a written language. As a result, traditional natural language processing tools, ranging from part-of-speech tagging to dependency parsing, cannot be easily applied. Second, short texts usually do not contain sufficient statistical signals to support many state-of-the-art approaches for text mining such as topic modeling. Third, short texts are more ambiguous and noisy, and are generated in an enormous volume, which further increases the difficulty to handle them. We argue that semantic knowledge is required in order to better understand short texts. In this work, we build a prototype system for short text understanding which exploits semantic knowledge provided by a well-known knowledgebase and automatically harvested from a web corpus. Our knowledge-intensive approaches disrupt traditional methods for tasks such as text segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and concept labeling, in the sense that we focus on semantics in all these tasks.

Our study makes several important contributions. First, by examining strategic positioning statements of geographically defined ventures, we contribute and advance our understanding of the geography of innovation and structure of entrepreneurial ecosystems. Our results indicate that there are wide differences in entrepreneurial ecosystem size, structure, composition, and venture strategic positioning. Second, methodologically, we use novel computational approaches and introduce visualization as a powerful means to understand entrepreneurial ecosystems. Third, our results show that ventures from widely different industries often use similar position statements, thus highlighting that ecosystems are indeed not just defined by industries, but also strategic positioning. We conclude with theoretical and managerial implications.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2018.2855435","Tennenbaum Institute, Georgia Tech; University of Virginia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425782","Cluster analysis;entrepreneurial ecosystems;strategic positioning;text analytics;visualization","Ecosystems;Entrepreneurship;Technological innovation;Text analysis;Visualization;Economics","business data processing;commerce;data visualisation;innovation management;organisational aspects;risk management;strategic planning;text analysis","venture similarity;venture strategic positioning;venture business descriptions;entrepreneurial ecosystems;computational approaches;text-based analysis;network visualizations;topic modeling","","13","","76","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the time of registration, app developers have to select, what they believe, is the most appropriate category for their apps. Besides the inherent ambiguity of selecting the right category, the approach leaves open the possibility of misuse and potential gaming by the registrant. Periodically, the app store will refine the list of categories available and potentially reassign the apps. However, it has been observed that the mismatch between the description of the app and the category it belongs to, continues to persist. Although some common mechanisms (e.g., a complaint-driven or manual checking) exist, they limit the response time to detect miscategorized apps and still open the challenge on categorization. We introduce FRAC+: (FR)amework for (A)pp (C)ategorization. FRAC+ has the following salient features: (i) it is based on a data-driven topic model and automatically suggests the categories appropriate for the app store, and (ii) it can detect miscategorizated apps.

Detecting fake news is a daunting challenge due to subtle difference between real and fake news. As a first step of fighting with fake news, this paper characterizes hundreds of popular fake and real news measured by shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook from two perspectives: domain reputations and content understanding. Our domain reputation analysis reveals that the Web sites of the fake and real news publishers exhibit diverse registration behaviors, registration timing, domain rankings, and domain popularity. In addition, fake news tends to disappear from the Web after a certain amount of time. The content characterizations on the fake and real news corpus suggest that simply applying term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling is inefficient in detecting fake news, while exploring document similarity with the term and word vectors is a very promising direction for predicting fake and real news. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to systematically study domain reputations and content characteristics of fake and real news, which will provide key insights for effectively detecting fake news on social media.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2018.9010139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8768083","social media;fake news detection;content modeling;domain reputations","Publishing;Internet;Radio spectrum management;Analytical models;Facebook","Internet;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","online social media;fake news publishers;real news publishers;fake news corpus;real news corpus;fake news detection;content understanding;Facebook;domain reputations analysis;Web sites;term frequency-inverse document frequency;Latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling","","10","","","","22 Jul 2019","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Before installing mobile applications, many users read reviews written by other users to determine whether or not the application is worth using. In addition, mobile application developers also rely on user reviews to get insight information on which aspects of the mobile application users like or do not like and why. They can use the information to market the beloved aspects of their software product and improve on the problematic ones. However, when there are many reviews, it is difficult to comprehend information in the user reviews. Several researches in recent years aim to extract opinions and sentiments from various texts or documents such as Twitter, webboards, and software product reviews. Most of these researches are for English documents. For Thai language, researches usually focus on other contexts such as hotel reviews or general opinions on Twitter. In this paper, we present an approach to analyze user reviews written in Thai based on techniques in natural language processing, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis. The approach aims to help Thai users and developers discover dynamically, instead of pre-determined, various aspects and associated sentiments from a vast amount of user reviews. The result of the approach is a list of aspects with associated opinions and sentiments to help users assess mobile applications and provide summarized user feedbacks for developers.","","978-1-5090-4834-2","10.1109/JCSSE.2017.8025903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8025903","","Mobile applications;Sentiment analysis;Feature extraction;Software;Tools;Speech;Analytical models","human factors;mobile computing;reviews","summarized user feedbacks;sentiment analysis;topic modeling;natural language processing;general opinions;hotel reviews;English documents;software product reviews;webboards;Twitter;mobile application users;mobile application developers;mobile devices;Thai language;user reviews","","5","","27","","7 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But as data becomes easier to acquire, we must understand the effect different textual data sources have on our resulting hypotheses. Are abstracts enough for HG, or does it need full-text papers? How many papers does an HG system need to make valuable predictions? How sensitive is a general-purpose HG system to hyperparameter values or input quality? What effect does corpus size and document length have on HG results? To answer these questions we train multiple versions of knowledge network-based HG system, MOLIERE, on varying corpora in order to compare challenges and trade offs in terms of result quality and computational requirements. MOLIERE generalizes main principles of similar knowledge network-based HG systems and reinforces them with topic modeling components. The corpora include the abstract and full-text versions of PubMed Central, as well as iterative halves of MEDLINE, which allows us to compare the effect document length and count has on the results. We find that, quantitatively, corpora with a higher median document length result in marginally higher quality results, yet require substantially longer to process. However, qualitatively, full-length papers introduce a significant number of intruder terms to the resulting topics, which decreases human interpretability. Additionally, we find that the effect of document length is greater than that of document count, even if both sets contain only paper abstracts.Reproducibility: Our code and data are available online at sybrandt.com/2018/abstracts.","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8621974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8621974","Literature Based Discovery;Hypothesis Generation;Scientific Text Mining;Applied Data Science","Knowledge engineering;Data mining;Unified modeling language;Information retrieval;Measurement;Feature extraction;Signal to noise ratio","data mining;knowledge based systems;text analysis","automatic hypothesis generation systems;knowledge network-based HG system;MOLIERE;topic modeling components;textual data sources;document length;text mining","","5","","40","","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a keyphrase extraction algorithm using maximum sequential pattern mining with one-off and general gaps condition, called Ke-MSMING, is presented. Ke_MSMING first searches all keyphrase candidates from a document using sequential patterns mining and the topic model, and then adopts supervised machine learning to classify each keyphrase candidate as a keyphrase or not. Finally, Ke_MSMING selects top-N keyphrases as the final keyphrases. Ke_MSMING not only uses baseline features and pattern features but also uses centrality features obtained from the cooccurrence semantic network, and the cooccurrence networks can yield powerful semantic relations for keyphrase extraction.

Discovering and understanding individuals’ cyber activities can provide useful implications for policymakers, service providers, and app developers. In this paper, we propose a framework to discover daily cyber activity patterns across people's mobile app usage. The framework first segments app usage traces into short time windows and then applies a probabilistic topic model to infer users’ cyber activities in each window. By constructing and exploring the coherence of users’ activity sequences, the framework can identify individuals’ daily patterns. Next, the framework uses a hierarchical clustering algorithm to recognize the common patterns across diverse groups of individuals. We apply the framework on a large-scale and real-world dataset, consisting of 653,092 users with 971,818,946 usage records of 2,000 popular mobile apps. Our analysis shows that people usually follow yesterday's activity patterns, but the patterns tend to deviate as the time-lapse increases. We also discover five common daily cyber activity patterns, including afternoon reading, nightly entertainment, pervasive socializing, commuting, and nightly socializing. Our findings have profound implications on identifying the demographics of users and their lifestyles, habits, service requirements, and further detecting other disrupting trends such as working overtime and addiction to the game and social media.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2020.3021987","Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:16214817); 5GEAR; FIT; CBAI(grant numbers:1319017); Academy of Finland; National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1800804); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1936217,61971267,61972223,61941117,61861136003); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:L182038); Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology(grant numbers:20031887521); Tsinghua University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9186847","Mobile app usage;activity pattern;pattern discovery;clustering","Mobile computing;Cyberspace;Microsoft Windows;Feature extraction;Smart phones;Probabilistic logic;Data collection","mobile computing;pattern clustering;smart phones","abundant behavior records;useful implications;service providers;app developers;mobile app usage;usage traces;short time windows;probabilistic topic model;hierarchical clustering algorithm;common patterns;971 usage records;818 usage records;946 usage records;2 apps;000 popular mobile apps;time-lapse increases;common daily cyber activity patterns;daily activity patterns","","2","","63","IEEE","4 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To analyze the reactions to posts, we used topic modeling and post tonality analysis. We proposed a method for the response prediction to posts based on the prediction for separate activity segments and combining results.

Different organizations in most social scopes use this context as an appropriate tool to find their strengths and weaknesses. In this field of research, the objective is to determine the positive or negative orientations of users towards the features of a product or commodity. Solving this problem consists of two main steps: aspect extraction and identifying the positive or negative tendencies of users towards those aspects. Two of the most critical issues of sentiment analysis in the Persian language are the lack of comprehensive labeled data and the significant difference between colloquial and formal sentences in Persian. One of the most important methods to confront the first problem is to apply unsupervised methods. In this research, a system for aspect-based sentiment analysis in the Persian language is proposed using unsupervised methods. The Sentiment words extraction step is done in another article [1]. The aspect extraction and clustering steps are done using topic modeling methods and neural networks and taking benefit of rule-based methods.

Several uses of phrase mining include information retrieval/extraction, taxonomy construction, and topic modeling. The existing strategy requires a prepared linguistic analyzer and has an unacceptable execution for new areas since it requires human specialists for labeling the phrase. The phrase generated in those systems for a given input text contains only a single word that may be often unambiguous to the user. The aim is to automate the phrase mining process and enhance its performance. The proposed method is a framework that requires minimal human labeling effort and only shallow linguistic analysis. A POS_tagger is used to extract the important words (nouns and noun phrases) from a text after which text ranking is applied. Then cosine similarity is used to identify the quality phrase from the text. Phrase quality can be estimated at two levels, once after POS_guided segmentation and then re-estimate the score at the end. Compared to the existing method, the proposed method has showna significant improvement in effectiveness and efficiency across different domains.

Furthermore, for reduced computational cost many of the state-of-the-art methods use standard Naïve Bayes for classification. However, priors used in this case may degrade the results due to the unavailability of training data. Moreover, cross project performance has rarely been discussed. To address these issues, we introduce a method namely Class-Membership Information of a Term (CMT) that does not use any priors, is computationally simple, free from parameter tuning and performs better compared to the existing methods.

However, service implicit features are ignored and have yet to be properly explored and leveraged. To this end, we propose a novel heuristics-based framework DeepWSC for web service clustering.

This is stored in the form of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) in a central repository. A medical record data is very huge, difficult to read and understand. To give an insight to the professionals in analyzing the different domains a patient belongs to, it is necessary to get pointers to a file before classifying it to a particular department for further analysis. This study provides a EMR processing system to automatically classify EMRs based on the important medical terms using TF-IDF and topic modeling. Automatic Classification of EMRs help the healthcare professionals in taking accurate decisions, providing efficient service, and improves the time taken for processing huge amount of data and in better organizing of patient. The data stored on the cloud may contain duplicate copies of EMR on several storage systems at file level thus increasing the network bandwidth, cost, and consuming storage space. Hence, a deduplication mechanism is required to avoid or reduce the data redundancy. Adapting cloud computing for healthcare systems necessitates sharing patient data with cloud service providers, which creates security concerns as the data may contain diagnosis, medication, laboratory results and medical claims. The main aim of this work is to classify the EMRs as per the specialization using KNN algorithm, optimize storage using deduplication and protect the data using DNA encryption algorithm before uploading to Hadoop. Data redundancy is taken care by implementing deduplication techniques using MD5 hashing. Proposed methodology shows an accuracy of 90% for EMR record classification and handles duplication and security aspects. This in-turn proves the state of the art approach for health care data management.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3161439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9739732","Classification;clustering;deduplication;DNA encryption;electronic medical records;Hadoop;map reduce","Medical services;Medical diagnostic imaging;Cloud computing;Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging;Electronic medical records;History","cloud computing;cryptography;data handling;health care;medical information systems;parallel processing;records management;storage management","healthcare providers;electronic medical records;medical record data;EMR processing system;medical terms;automatic classification;healthcare professionals;storage systems;data redundancy;healthcare systems necessitates;patient data;cloud service providers;medical claims;deduplication;security aspects;health care data management;secure EMR classification;KNN algorithm;Hadoop;MD5 hashing;TF-IDF;topic modeling","","","","30","CCBY","22 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In 2017, U.S. businesses lost $75 billion through poor customer service, where customers encountered unhelpful staff or spent too much time on unresolved issues. Customer experience management software companies analyze call center customer-agent transcriptions using methods such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling to improve their clients' customer service. However, these approaches are not optimized to account for the sequential nature of these customer-agent interactions. For example, while it is important to know how many customers cancel a service, businesses also need to understand how agents respond to a cancellation request and how certain actions may lead to a positive or negative outcome. To analyze the progression of conversations and understand actions that maximize positive outcomes, our research represents each contact center dialogue as a Markov decision process (MDP). For each conversation, we annotated whether the problem was resolved and whether the outcome was good or bad from a business perspective. We employed natural language processing (NLP) to extract the customer states and agent actions from call transcriptions. Our results identify and visualize the most frequent transcription sequences from successful conversations and estimate the expected probability of an outcome when an agent takes an action given a certain customer state. Such an approach may be used to develop programs to train agents for improved customer service in call centers.","","978-1-7281-0998-5","10.1109/SIEDS.2019.8735616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735616","customer experience;Markov decision process;natural language processing","Customer services;Biological system modeling;Analytical models;Natural language processing;Companies;Atmospheric modeling","call centres;customer services;learning (artificial intelligence);marketing data processing;Markov processes;multi-agent systems;natural language processing;probability","customer service;customer-agent interactions;machine learning;agent actions;customer state;natural language processing;Markov decision process;contact center dialogue;cancellation request;topic modeling;sentiment analysis;call center customer-agent transcriptions;customer experience management software companies","","","","15","","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With an alarming contagious rate and no effective treatments or vaccines, it has evoked all sorts of reactions. In this paper, we propose a framework to analyze and characterize groups' behavior with opposed stances and the relation with the political polarization, using the Brazilian COVID polarized scenario as a case study. The pro/against social distance stances are represented by two Twitter groups referred to as Chloroquiners and Quarenteners. The framework encompasses: a) techniques to automatically infer from users their demographics and political orientation, b) topic modeling to discover the major concerns expressed by each group; c) network analysis and community detection to characterize their behavior as a social network group; d) analysis of linguistic characteristics to identify psychological aspects, and e) the characterization of information sources and external influences to evaluate the ”echo chamber effect”. These properties aim to explain the group's behavior using the Identity Protective Cognitive theory, in which culturally grouped individuals give biased credit and dismiss evidence according to the predominant group beliefs. Our main findings confirm that the political polarization of Chloroquiners and Quarenteners influence the arguments of economy and life, and support/opposition to the president. As a group, the network of Chloroquiners is more closed and connected, and highly influenced by information passed through social networks. Quarenteners have a more diverse political engagement and are more influenced by formal media. In terms of psychological aspects, the use of Identity Protection Cognition provides more robust arguments to explain these behaviors.","","978-1-6654-1924-6","10.1109/WIIAT50758.2020.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9457781","political polarization;COVID-19;analysis framework;Identity Protective Cognition","COVID-19;Social networking (online);Pandemics;Psychology;Media;Linguistics;Cognition","behavioural sciences computing;cognition;diseases;epidemics;politics;psychology;social networking (online);text analysis","political polarization;worldwide COVID-19 pandemic;Twitter groups;political orientation;psychological aspects;echo chamber effect;social networks;political engagement;chloroquiners;quarenteners;topic modeling;identity protective cognitive theory;linguistic characteristics analysis","","","","17","","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These surveys usually include both open-ended questions and Likert-type scale questions but the answers to open questions tend not to be analysed further than simply reading them. Recent research has shown that text mining and machine learning methods can be utilized to extract useful topics from masses of open student feedback. However, to our knowledge, not many off-the-shelf applications exist for processing open-ended student feedback automatically. Additionally, the use of text mining tools may not be available to all educators, as they require in-depth knowledge of text-mining, data analysis, or programming tools. To address this gap the current study presents a tool (Palaute) for analyzing written student feedback using topic modeling and emotion analysis. The utility of this tool is demonstrated with two real-life use cases: First, we analyze student feedback data collected from courses in a software engineering degree programme, and then feedback from all courses organized in a university. In our experiments, the analysis of open-ended feedback revealed that on certain software engineering course modules the workload is perceived as heavy, and on some programming courses the automatic code grader could be improved. The university-wide analysis produced indicators of good teaching quality, such as interesting courses, but also some concrete improvement points like the time given to complete course assignments. Therefore, the use of the tool resulted in actionable improvement points, which could not have been identified using only numeric feedback metrics.

Besides being used to query information, online platforms are the medium to exchange opinions and discuss various topics via posts or comments.

Researchers therefore have studied how to automatically analyze posts and comments to extract topics and their sentiments using techniques such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis. There are various approaches to analyze sentiments, and many of them utilize sentiment lexicons, a set of words annotated with sentiment, to help with the analysis. Several researches have constructed sentiment lexicons for English language. This paper aims to construct sentiment lexicons for Thai language using a dictionary-based approach in combination with a crowdsourcing approach. First, words are chosen from a Thai dictionary, mostly adjectives since they usually express sentiment. Next, a web application is developed so that users can help vote whether a particular word is positive, negative, or neutral. After a number of votes have been collected, each word is scored to determine its sentiment. To validate and ensure users are voting truthfully, users are authenticated via Facebook, and simple checks are carried out against answers of each user. This process results in a sentiment lexicons for Thai words and should help form the basis for sentiment analysis of Thai text.","2374-314X","978-1-7281-7602-4","10.1109/KST51265.2021.9415804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9415804","sentiment lexicon;sentiment analysis;Thai","Crowdsourcing;Sentiment analysis;Analytical models;Dictionaries;Social networking (online);Annotations;Authentication","natural language processing;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","topic modeling;sentiment analysis;Thai language;Thai dictionary;Thai sentiment lexicon construction;online platforms;Thai citizens;Facebook","","","","7","","6 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fewer attentions have been paid to the epidemic of the diseases. In this paper, we present a social media analytics tool, called HealthTvizer, for exploring health awareness using Twitter data through interactive and interconnected multiple views. We use topic modeling to pick the relevant and meaningful terms from more than 57 million tweets. We detect the disease name and related contents which are shared by the users of different geographical locations (mostly in the United States). We believe that the collected geolocations from the users' tweets can reveal the patterns of diseases for a given term which allows a researcher to detect, analyze, and explore information about the diseases and hence take necessary steps to improve public health awareness. We validate the effectiveness of HealthTvizer through an informal user study.

To enable self-directed learning, assessment practices increasingly embrace assessment for learning rather than the assessment of learning, shifting the focus from grades and scores to provision of rich, narrative, and personalized feedback. Students are expected to collect, interpret, and give meaning to this feedback, in order to self-assess their progress and to formulate new, appropriate learning goals and strategies. However, interpretation of aggregated, longitudinal narrative feedback has been proven to be very challenging, cognitively demanding, and time consuming. In this article, we, therefore, explored the applicability of existing, proven text mining techniques to support feedback interpretation. More specifically, we investigated whether it is possible to automatically generate meaningful information about prevailing topics and the emotional load of feedback provided in medical students’ competence-based portfolios (N = 1500), taking into account the competence framework and the students’ various performance levels. Our findings indicate that the text-mining techniques topic modeling and sentiment analysis make it feasible to automatically unveil the two principal aspects of narrative feedback, namely the most relevant topics in the feedback and their sentiment.

One such problem is identifying and classifying software requirements on Stack Overflow (SO). The suitability of ML-based techniques to this tackle problem has shown convincing results, much better than those generated by some traditional natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Nevertheless, a comprehensive and systematic comprehension of these ML based techniques is still deficient. Objective: To identify and classify the type of ML algorithms used for identifying software requirements on SO. Method: This article reports systematic literature review (SLR) gathering evidence published up to August, 2019. Results: This study identified 1073 published papers related to RE and SO. Only 12 primary papers were selected. The data extraction process revealed that; 1) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling is the most widely used ML algorithm in the selected studies, and 2) Precision and recall are the most commonly used evaluation method to measure the performance of these ML algorithms. Conclusion: The SLR finds that while ML algorithms have great potential in the identification of RE on SO, they face some open issues that will ultimately affect their performance and practical application. The SLR calls for the collaboration between RE and ML researchers, to tackle the open issues facing the development of real-world ML systems.","2327-0594","978-1-7281-0945-9","10.1109/ICSESS47205.2019.9040720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9040720","Requirements engineering;Machine learning;algorithms;Systematic Literature Review;Stack Overflow","Software;Machine learning algorithms;Software algorithms;Classification algorithms;Systematics;Requirements engineering;Data mining","document handling;formal specification;learning (artificial intelligence);software quality;systems analysis","empirical evaluation;machine learning algorithms;software requirements;Stack Overflow;requirements engineering methods;machine-learning algorithms;topic modeling;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;real-world ML systems;SLR;systematic literature review;ML algorithms;ML based techniques;systematic comprehension;comprehensive comprehension;ML-based techniques;complex RE problems","","","","36","IEEE","19 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we define the hyperactive user on the social media platform Facebook, both theoretically and mathematically. We apply a geometric topic modelling algorithm (GTM) on German political parties' posts and user comments to identify the topics discussed. We prove that hyperactive users have a significant role in the political discourse: They become opinion leaders, as well as set the content of discussions, thus creating an alternate picture of the public opinion.

In this paper, we focused on the problem of identifying communities and learning the semantics interpretation of modules jointly in an end-to-end model. We designed a novel generative model which combines two closely related parts, one for community discovery and the other for content clustering and semantics interpretation. By extracting the potential correlation between these two parts, our new method is not only robust to discovering communities, but also able to provide a community with more than one semantic topic. As for model inference, we developed a variational algorithm from a Bayesian point of view.

It is well known that AECs failures represent the major cause for breakdown of power electronics equipment. Hence, the development of robust control strategies, that allow to evaluate the electrolytic capacitor state, while keeping the performance of the converter control strategies, even under the occurrence of a capacitor fault, gains further emphasis. For that purpose, model-based predictive control (MBPC) applied to power electronics is a hot research topic that has been receiving the attention of researchers, given its advantages in terms of robustness, reduced tuning effort and, when applicable, fault tolerance. In turn, model-free predictive control (MFPC) is an underdeveloped research topic, that requires further efforts. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the literature does not report any MFPC strategy aimed at DC-DC converters. Accordingly, this paper proposes the combination of a novel MFPC strategy with the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) method, aiming to perform an online estimation of the ESR and C parameters, thus allowing a continuous evaluation of the electrolytic capacitor condition and, consequently, avoid a total system failure. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by several experimental tests.","","978-1-7281-8071-7","10.1109/CPE-POWERENG50821.2021.9501188","European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(grant numbers:POCI-01-0145-FEDER-029494); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9501188","DC-DC interleaved boost converters;Electrolytic capacitors;Equivalent series resistance (ESR);Capacitance (C);Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT);Model-free predictive control (MFPC)","Fourier transforms;Fault detection;Capacitors;Estimation;Predictive models;Power electronics;Robustness","condition monitoring;DC-DC power convertors;electrolytic capacitors;fault tolerance;Fourier transforms;power electronics;predictive control;robust control","MFPC;MBPC;STFT;short time fourier transform method;AEC failures;underdeveloped research topic;model-free predictive control;model-based predictive control;capacitor fault;converter control strategies;electrolytic capacitor state;robust control strategies;power electronics equipment;conventional amplifier converter;power converters;DC link;aluminum electrolytic capacitors;model-free predictive controller;DC-DC interleaved boost converters;online condition monitoring;electrolytic capacitor condition;novel MFPC strategy;DC-DC converters","","","","26","","10 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For OCF in resource-constrained and subadditive task oriented domains, an agent may not possess sufficient resources to meet the needs of multiple coalitions simultaneously. As a result, there may exist many potential resource conflicts among the rival overlapping coalitions. To tackle such situations, we first present a natural variation of the traditional OCF model and analyze the size of the solution space and the computational complexity of the overlapping coalition structure generation (OCSG) problem. Next, we develop a generic task-oriented heuristic (TOH) for individual repairs that can be used in binary meta-heuristic algorithms to generate overlapping coalitions in a parallel manner. Moreover, we show how the proposed TOH repairs a 2-D individual to resolve resource conflicts and discuss several basic properties. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of TOH, we compare it with the existing agent-oriented heuristic for the OCSG problem.

Due to both its importance in applications and its challenging difficulty, lead and accompaniment separation has been a popular topic in signal processing for decades. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of this research topic, organizing the different approaches according to whether they are model-based or data-centered. For model-based methods, we organize them according to whether they concentrate on the lead signal, the accompaniment, or both. For data-centered approaches, we discuss the particular difficulty of obtaining data for learning lead separation systems, and then review recent approaches, notably those based on deep learning.

Most recent phishing detection researches have focused on obtaining highly distinctive features from the metadata and text of these e-mails. The obtained attributes are then used to feed classification algorithms in order to determine whether they are phishing or legitimate messages. In this paper, it is proposed an approach based on machine learning to detect phishing e-mail attacks. The methods that compose this approach are performed through a feature engineering process based on natural language processing, lemmatization, topics modeling, improved learning techniques for resampling and cross-validation, and hyperparameters configuration. The first proposed method uses all the features obtained from the Document-Term Matrix (DTM) in the classification algorithms. The second one uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as a operation to deal with the problems of the “curse of dimensionality”, the sparsity, and the text context portion included in the obtained representation.

These models normally train various forms of neural networks on top of pretrained word embeddings using a task-specific corpus. However, most of these works neglect the multisense nature of words in the pretrained word embeddings. In this paper we introduce topic models to enrich the word embeddings for multisenses of words. The integration of the topic model with various semantic compositional processes leads to topic-aware convolutional neural network and topic-aware long short term memory networks. Different from previous multisense word embeddings models that assign multiple independent and sense-specific embeddings to each word, our proposed models are lightweight and have flexible frameworks that regard word sense as the composition of two parts: a general sense derived from a large corpus and a topic-specific sense derived from a task-specific corpus. In addition, our proposed models focus on semantic composition instead of word understanding. With the help of topic models, we can integrate the topic-specific sense at word-level before the composition and sentence-level after the composition. Comprehensive experiments on five public sentence classification datasets are conducted and the results show that our proposed topic-aware deep compositional models produce competitive or better performance than other text representation learning methods.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2016.2632521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755816","Machine learning;natural language processing;sentence classification;text representation learning","Semantics;Neural networks;Context;Natural language processing;Numerical models;Machine learning;Computational modeling","convolution;natural language processing;neural nets;pattern classification;text analysis","topic-aware deep compositional models;sentence classification;representation learning;computational linguistic;natural language processing;semantic compositional processes;topic-aware convolutional neural network;topic-aware long short term memory networks;multisense word embeddings;sense-specific embeddings;word sense;task-specific corpus;topic-specific sense;word-level;sentence-level","","20","","63","IEEE","23 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these methods fail to fully exploit the potential of topic models in uncovering image semantics and need extra sparsity constraints, which greatly increases the complexity of the model. To solve these problems, a union framework with sparse topic relaxion and group clustering (USTRGC) is proposed. In USTRGC, the implied sparse prior constraints by the sparse topic model are introduced. Through the relaxation of model, the influence caused by the endmember variability on the unmixing accuracy can be alleviated. Furthermore, unmixing models of different category are united to alleviate the ill-posed nature of the model, thereby improving the fractional abundance.

Hence, discovering heterogeneous semantics (e.g., heterogeneous types of latent topics) is critical for the performance of these tasks, and it is necessary to design a model that meets this demand. Furthermore, with the arrival of the big data era and the increasing awareness of data privacy, it is necessary to study the issues of mining heterogeneous semantics with high efficiency while avoiding compromising data privacy. In this work, we develop a novel method called Heterogeneous Latent Topic Discovery (HLTD) which seamlessly integrates topic modeling with word embedding to discover heterogeneous latent topics. By coupling parameter-server architecture with new private sampling algorithms, HLTD can be efficiently trained with effective protection of underlying data privacy. We evaluate HLTD through a wide range of qualitative and quantitative metrics in industry.

Therefore, we propose a novel Topic Supervision BERT-based model (TSB) for text matching. TSB provides a reference multi-task joint training framework involving two types of topic supervision, including explicit and implicit topic supervision. To constrain consistent topic correspondences between texts, we introduce a supervised auxiliary learning task to incorporate explicit pre-defined topic supervision. Furthermore, to adapt to latent topic structures for mutual benefit between text representations and multiple tasks, we integrate a topic model into a contextual text representation model BERT to mine and incorporate implicit self-learnable topic supervision. Experimental results show that TSB supplements explicit and implicit topic information through a multi-task learning approach, which significantly improves the performance of text matching on two public datasets, especially on challenging short text matches.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-8671-9","10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892023","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976156,61702367); Tianjin Science and Technology Commissioner project(grant numbers:20YDTPJC00560); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin(grant numbers:19JCYBJC15300,18JCQNJC69800); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9892023","Text Matching;Topic Supervision;Semantic Similarity;Multi-Task Learning;Pre-trained Model","Training;Adaptation models;Semantics;Neural networks;Bit error rate;Multitasking;Natural language processing","","","","","","30","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We find that diary entries exhibit consistent themes, extracted using topic modeling, and emotional perspective, drawn from dictionary-informed sentiment features. Using these features, we use regularized regression to predict screening measures for depression and psychological aggression by an intimate partner.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel image captioning method consisting of four modules: enhanced topic predictor (ETP), retrieval-based topics re-weighting module (RTR), subsequent topic predictor (STP), and caption generation module. The prediction and generation modules are trained in an end-to-end manner to promote the efficient use of topics by predicting suitable topics at each time step. ETP predicts the topics using the image features, and is enhanced with topic embedding (TE). The RTR is only applied in the testing stage for re-weighting the topics predicted by ETP. In each time step, the STP automatically predicts concise topics subsets to alleviate the diversity of the image topics. Compared with the existing topic-based models, our model can automatically generate more accurate and diverse captions, boosting the explainability of how the topics influence the generated word in each time step. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmark datasets show that our method enhances the overall image captioning's performance and the topic prediction task, and outperforms many recent image captioning approaches in terms of the evaluation metrics.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2022.3202690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9869686","Image captioning;topic embedding;enhanced topic predictor;retrieval-based topic re-weighting;subsequent topic predictor;end-to-end manner","Feature extraction;Semantics;Task analysis;Decoding;Visualization;Predictive models;Training","","","","","","","IEEE","29 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, there is no unified standard for dividing public opinion topics. And the existing technology cannot adapt to the characteristics of the multi-source network platform well. This paper proposes a semi-supervised topic mining method. The core of this method is the semi-supervised hierarchical clustering algorithm improved from the traditional hierarchical clustering algorithm. On the basis of this algorithm, the optimization is carried out from the perspectives of model input vectorization and high-quality topic selection. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper can be effectively applied to the topic and hierarchical structure mining of short texts on multi-source network platforms with a wide range of topics, lots of text noise and a lack of grammatical norms. It accurately extracts the common topic and characteristic topic of the platform and the hierarchy between topics. Experiments show that this method can mine the topic and its hierarchy effectively, and it is better than the traditional LDA topic model in hierarchical structure mining and fine-grained topic mining. By analyzing the text data of the multi-source network platform, the thesis can dig out the topics and the hierarchical relationship among topics, which is conducive to analysis the subsequent research on theme retrieval and theme evolution. At the same time, network platform users and managers can obtain topic distribution information in a systematic and centralized manner. It is of great significance to guide the network's public sentiment and create a good network public opinion environment.","","978-1-7281-4528-0","10.1109/DSC.2019.00073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8923460","Topic Mining;Hierarchy;Semi-supervised Cluster;Multi-source Network Platform","Data mining;Clustering algorithms;Semantics;Internet;Neural networks;Telecommunications;Manuals","data mining;information retrieval;pattern clustering;sentiment analysis;text analysis","hierarchical structure mining;high-quality topic selection;traditional hierarchical clustering algorithm;semisupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm;semisupervised topic mining method;dividing public opinion topics;characteristic topic;heterogeneous network information platform;improved hierarchical;multisource network public opinion;good network public opinion environment;topic distribution information;network platform users;hierarchical relationship;multisource network platform;fine-grained topic mining","","1","","11","","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To accelerate the training/testing process, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods are introduced. However, such models usually utilize the same set of filters to convolve all input documents, and hence, the unique information inherent in each document may not be fully captured. To alleviate this issue, we propose a CNN-based model that employs a set of dynamic filters. Specifically, the proposed model extracts the aspects in a document using the filters generated from the aspect information intrinsic in the document. With the dynamically generated filters, our model is capable of learning more important features concerning aspects, thus promoting the effectiveness of aspect extraction. Furthermore, considering that aspects can be grouped into certain topics that conversely indicate the target words that need to be extracted, we naturally introduce a neural topic model (NTM) and integrate latent topics into the CNN-based module to help identify aspects. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the joint model is able to effectively identify aspects and produce interpretable topics.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3119026","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972426,62072483); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A1515010536,2021A1515012172); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1711262,U1711261,U1811264,U1811261,U1911203,U2001211); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B1515130001); Key R and D Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010107005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9585303","Aspect extraction;convolutional neural network (CNN);dynamic filter;topic mining.","Task analysis;Convolutional neural networks;Hidden Markov models;Feature extraction;Semantics;Unsupervised learning;Support vector machines","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Thus, in this paper, a novel approach called ""policy knowledge graph for the coordination among the government departments"" (PG-CODE) is proposed, which incorporates topic modeling into policy knowledge graphs. Similar to a knowledge graph, a policy knowledge graph uses a graph-structured data model to integrate policy discourse. With latent Dirichlet allocation embedding, a policy knowledge graph could capture the underlying topics of the policies. Furthermore, coordination strength and topic diffusion among hierarchical departments could be inferred from the PG-CODE, as it can provide a better representation of coordination within the policy space.

Routines can be categorized on the basis of some discernible properties like frequency, recurrence and periodicity. Commonly researched solutions to discover routines/activities of daily living are based on topic modeling or association rule mining (ARM). Both ARM and topic modeling based approaches are computationally expensive and do not acknowledge routine categorization, hence are not guaranteed to discover all different kinds of routines. In this paper we propose a simple, efficient and unsupervised framework for routine discovery in smart homes based by exploiting properties of routines which categorize them. We define and leverage such properties to discover routines utilizing an iterative algorithm, where routines from a specific category are discovered at each iteration. We have demonstrated a routine discovery system FIBI by implementing the framework and have achieved more than 80% recall and more than 90% precision across different categories of routines defined under FIBI, across three different market segments - social climber, affluent nester and urban dweller.","","978-1-5386-7503-8","10.1109/FiCloud.2018.00049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8458026","activity discovery;routine;activities of daily living;home automation;smart home","Smart homes;Iterative methods;Automation;Computational modeling;Microsoft Windows;Internet;Ecosystems","home automation","routine categorization;smart homes;user routine discovery;smart environments;smart home automation;routine discovery system","","1","","12","","11 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These 3000+ students were enrolled in a community-based learning program between 2014 and 2018 at San Francisco State University, a 4-year public degree-granting university. To address the ongoing challenge of low retention and graduation rates, this program has introduced early and preventative interventions through both mandatory and voluntary advising with a team of 40+ advisors. We apply statistical and machine learning approaches to analyze the advising records generated over a period of 5 years. Specifically, we have addressed the following problems: (1) what is the impact of timing and frequency of advising interactions on students' retention and graduation status? (2) how effective are such interactions in helping academically at-risk students? (3) What are the common types of interactions and how are they correlated with students' academic performance? Finally, (4) how much insight can we further gain through looking into advisors' written notes? Our results show that the current advising practice is not biased against a specific demographic group. They also show that it is important to require advising during a student's first term of her college career. Delaying such interactions to the second term, for instance, can significantly lower the likelihood to retain students in their third term and then seventh term, consequently reducing their chance to graduate within four or five years. Finally, after having applied a host of natural language processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., LDA topic modeling) to advisors' written notes, the results suggest that a more rigorous note-taking approach is needed in order for such notes to help gain broader and deeper insights into students' advising needs.

Analysis of OOV words reveals that a majority of them are proper names (PNs). However, PNs are important for automatic indexing of audio-video content and for obtaining reliable automatic transcriptions. In this paper, we focus on the problem of OOV PNs in diachronic audio documents. To enable the recovery of the PNs missed by the LVCSR system, relevant OOV PNs are retrieved by exploiting the semantic context of the LVCSR transcriptions. For retrieval of OOV PNs, we explore topic and semantic context derived from latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models, continuous word vector representations and the neural bag-of-words (NBOW) model which is capable of learning task specific word and context representations. We propose a neural bag-of-weighted words (NBOW2) model which learns to assign higher weights to words that are important for retrieval of an OOV PN. With experiments on French broadcast news videos, we show that the NBOW and NBOW2 models outperform the methods based on raw embeddings from LDA and Skip-gram models. Combining the NBOW and NBOW2 models gives a faster convergence during training. Second pass speech recognition experiments, in which the LVCSR vocabulary and language model are updated with the retrieved OOV PNs, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed context models.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2017.2651361","French National Research Agency ContNomina(grant numbers:ANR-12-BS02-0009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7812699","Large vocabulary continuous speech recognition;out-of-vocabulary;proper names;semantic context","Context;Vocabulary;Context modeling;Speech recognition;Semantics;Training;Computational modeling","indexing;speech recognition;vocabulary","semantic context;out-of-vocabulary words;OOV words;diachronic nature;broadcast news data;large vocabulary continuous speech recognition;proper names;automatic indexing;audio-video content;reliable automatic transcriptions;diachronic audio documents;LVCSR transcriptions;topic context;latent Dirichlet allocation;continuous word vector representations;task specific word;context representations;neural bag-of-weighted word model;French broadcast news videos;raw embeddings;skip-gram models;second pass speech recognition","","11","","75","IEEE","10 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing sentiment-based text summarization methods only pay attention to the sentiment polarity of either a single sentence or a whole document, ignoring changes of sentiments along with sentences or sentiment flow across the whole document. To incorporate the above two aspects into the summarization process to generate high-quality summaries, we propose a topic sentiment summarization framework based on reaching definition (TSSRD). In the framework, we first use topic models to model documents and calculate topic sentiment embeddings. Then, we analyze document structures from different perspectives to design data flow diagrams, in which improved reaching definition is used to analyze sentiment changes and sentiment flow. Finally, topic sentiment summaries are generated based on sentiments in steady states of the reaching definition. To evaluate our summarization framework, we introduce an extrinsic evaluation method. In this method, a sentiment classifier is trained by the topic sentiment summaries, and accuracy of the sentiment classification is used as a quality score. Experimental results demonstrate that our summarization framework is at least 2.32% better than baselines on IMDb and Amazon datasets.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2022.3186015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9806183","Reaching definition;sentiment analysis;summarization","Sentiment analysis;Analytical models;Semantics;Feature extraction;Affective computing;Dictionaries;Task analysis","","","","","","","IEEE","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Point of interest (POI) recommendation is a kind of important recommendation in LBSNs for enhancing user experiences. Unlike online social networks, LBSNs have a great deal of check-in data and comment information, which can provide valuable information for POI recommendation. In this paper, a novel recommendation strategy using tensor factorization is proposed for improving accurate rate of POI recommendation. Firstly, the latent dirichlet allocation(LDA) topic model is used to extract topic information and generate topic probability distribution of each POI based on comment information from users. Secondly, the check-in data of each user is divided into multiple data slices corresponding to each hour of a day. By connecting with the topic distributions of the visited POIs of each user, a user-topic-time tensor is conducted to present the potential preferences of all users. Finally, a higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) algorithm is employed to decompose the third-order tensor, to get dense preference information for POI recommendation. The experiments on a real dataset show that the proposed approach have better performance than the baseline methods.","2375-0324","978-1-5386-4133-0","10.1109/MDM.2018.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8411268","POI recommendation;Location based-social networks;LDA model;Tensor factorization","Tensile stress;Mathematical model;Probability distribution;Social network services;Data mining;Singular value decomposition;Global Positioning System","human factors;location based services;probability;recommender systems;singular value decomposition;social networking (online);tensors","LBSNs;check-in data;comment information;POI recommendation;tensor factorization;user-topic-time tensor;location-based social networks;HOSVD;higher order singular value decomposition;probability distribution;LDA;user experiences;Gowalla;foursquare;wireless communication technologies;point of interest recommendation;topic information extraction;latent dirichlet allocation","","13","","25","","16 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To support these processes more efficiently, this article presents an artificial-intelligence-based data mining model that helps firms spot emerging topics and trends at a higher level of automation than before. Its modular structure consists of components for query generation, data collection, data preprocessing, topic modeling, topic analysis, and visualization, combined in such a way that only a minimum amount of manual effort is required during its initial set up. The approach also incorporates self-adaptive capabilities, allowing the model to automatically update itself once new data has become available. The model parameterization is based on latest research in this area, and its threshold parameter is learnt during supervised training using a training data set. We have applied our model to an independent test data set to verify its effectiveness as an early warning system. By means of a retrospective analysis, we show in three case studies that our model is able to identify emerging technologies prior to their first publication in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies.

Clustering Web services according to their functionalities becomes an efficient way to facilitate the Web services discovery as well as the services management. Existing methods for Web services clustering mostly focus on utilizing directly key features from WSDL documents, e.g., input/output parameters and keywords from description text. Probabilistic topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is also adopted, which extracts latent topic features of WSDL documents to represent Web services, to improve the accuracy of Web services clustering. However, the power of the basic LDA model for clustering is limited to some extent. Some auxiliary features can be exploited to enhance the ability of LDA. Since the word vectors obtained by Word2vec is with higher quality than those obtained by LDA model, we propose, in this paper, an augmented LDA model (named WE-LDA) which leverages the high-quality word vectors to improve the performance of Web services clustering. In WE-LDA, the word vectors obtained by Word2vec are clustered into word clusters by K-means++ algorithm and these word clusters are incorporated to semi-supervise the LDA training process, which can elicit better distributed representations of Web services. A comprehensive experiment is conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method based on a ground truth dataset crawled from ProgrammableWeb. Compared with the state-of-the-art, our approach has an average improvement of 5.3% of the clustering accuracy with various metrics.","","978-1-5386-0752-7","10.1109/ICWS.2017.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029739","Web services;clustering;Word2vec;LDA;K-means++","Feature extraction;Clustering algorithms;Semantics;Probabilistic logic;Mashups;Tools","pattern clustering;text analysis;Web services","Word embeddings augmented LDA model;Web services clustering;appropriate Web services;Web services discovery;services management;word vectors;Word2vec;word clusters;WSDL documents;WSDL documents;latent Dirichlet allocation;k-means++ algorithm;Programmable Web","","48","","29","","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a holistic approach named Human Mobility Representation Model (HMRM) to simultaneously produce the vector representations of all four (explicit and implicit) attributes. The merits of HMRM lie in that: (1) it models the latent activity types and learns trajectory attribute embeddings in an integrated manner, and (2) it connects the activity-related distributions and these attributes embeddings by adding a newly designed collaborative learning component, and makes them mutually exchanged to take the best of both worlds. We apply HMRM to both unsupervised and supervised tasks including two activity evaluation tasks and two embedding evaluation tasks, on two real check-in datasets collected from Foursquare. Experimental results show that HMRM could not only improve the performance of capturing latent activity types, but also learn better trajectory embeddings.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.3001025","Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2019BF010); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61906107,61572289,61972069,61836007,61832017,61532018); Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Urban Natural Resources Monitoring and Simulation; Ministry of Natural Resources; NSERC Discovery(grant numbers:RGPIN-2017-05723,RGPIN-2018-06641); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9112685","Human mobility representation model;attribute representation learning;activity modeling;trajectory embedding;collaborative learning","Trajectory;Semantics;Tensors;Task analysis;Data models;Context modeling;Collaborative work","computer aided instruction;data mining;groupware;learning (artificial intelligence)","modeling spatial trajectories;attribute Representation learning;positioning devices;explicit attributes;user ID;location ID;time-stamp;implicit attribute;activity type;text mining;different attribute representations;introducing latent activity types;time context;low-dimensional space;embedding techniques;holistic approach;Human Mobility Representation Model;HMRM;vector representations;trajectory attribute embeddings;activity-related distributions;attributes embeddings;newly designed collaborative learning component;activity evaluation tasks;embedding evaluation tasks;trajectory embeddings","","6","","46","IEEE","9 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we aim to accurately estimate more fine-grained worker reliability for latent topics in numerical tasks, so as to further improve the result quality. We propose a bayesian probabilistic model named Gaussian Latent Topic Model(GLTM) to mine the latent topics of numerical tasks based on workers' behaviors and to estimate workers' topic-level reliability. By utilizing the GLTM, we propose a truth inference algorithm named TI-GLTM to accurately infer the tasks' truth and topics simultaneously and dynamically update workers' topic-level reliability. We also design an online task assignment mechanism called MRA-GLTM, which assigns appropriate tasks to workers with the Maximum Reduced Ambiguity principle.

This resulted to children contracting other diseases like measles due to the lack of immunization [1] [2]. The preference to not have newborns undergo vaccination program remains a threat to public health. Using publicly accessible tweets, this study aims to understand health perceptions of the public in relation to Dengvaxia. A deep neural network approach using n-gram vectorization is used in comparison to the Doc2Vec neural network classifier to identify tweets containing personal perception on health. It was discovered that not only does the bigram model perform better in classifying than the Doc2Vec model with a performance measure of 86.25% accuracy, 0.85 precision, 0.86 ROC and 0.85 F1 score, but also it is able to identify clearer and more diverse topic using LDA topic modeling in comparison with unigram and trigram model.

The conventional topic extraction schemes require human intervention and involve also comprehensive pre-processing tasks to represent text collections in an appropriate way. In this paper, we present a two-stage framework for topic extraction from scientific literature. The presented scheme employs a two-staged procedure, where word embedding schemes have been utilized in conjunction with cluster analysis. To extract significant topics from text collections, we propose an improved word embedding scheme, which incorporates word vectors obtained by word2vec, POS2vec, word-position2vec and LDA2vec schemes. In the clustering phase, an improved clustering ensemble framework, which incorporates conventional clustering methods (i.e., k-means, k-modes, k-means++, self-organizing maps and DIANA algorithm) by means of the iterative voting consensus, has been presented. In the empirical analysis, we analyze a corpus containing 160,424 abstracts of articles from various disciplines, including agricultural engineering, economics, engineering and computer science. In the experimental analysis, performance of the proposed scheme has been compared to conventional baseline clustering methods (such as, k-means, k-modes, and k-means++), LDA-based topic modelling and conventional word embedding schemes. The empirical analysis reveals that ensemble word embedding scheme yields better predictive performance compared to the baseline word vectors for topic extraction. Ensemble clustering framework outperforms the baseline clustering methods. The results obtained by the proposed framework show an improvement in Jaccard coefficient, Folkes & Mallows measure and F1 score.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2945911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8861084","topic extraction;machine learning;Cluster analysis;text mining","Task analysis;Clustering algorithms;Text categorization;Data analysis;Clustering methods;Text mining","data analysis;data mining;information analysis;pattern clustering;text analysis","bibliometric data analysis;word embeddings;data mining;knowledge discovery;cluster analysis;word2vec;POS2vec;word-position2vec;LDA2vec schemes;clustering ensemble framework;baseline word vectors;ensemble clustering framework;two-stage topic extraction model;topic extraction schemes;word embedding scheme;baseline clustering methods;word embedding schemes;iterative voting consensus","","44","","60","CCBY","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A series of policy shifts by various governmental bodies have been speculated to have contributed to the polarization of face masks. A typical method to investigate the effects of these policy shifts is to use surveys. However, survey-based approaches have multiple limitations: biased responses, limited sample size, badly crafted questions may skew responses and inhibit insight, and responses may prove quickly irrelevant as opinions change in response to a dynamic topic. We propose a novel approach to 1) accurately gauge public sentiment towards face masks in the United States during COVID-19 using a multi-modal demographic inference framework with topic modeling and 2) determine whether face mask policy shifts contributed to polarization towards face masks using offline change point analysis on Twitter data. First, we infer several key demographics of individual Twitter users such as their age, gender, and whether they are a college student using a multi-modal demographic prediction framework and analyze the average sentiment for each respective demographic. Next, we conduct topic analysis using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Finally, we conduct offline change point discovery on our sentiment time series data using the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) search algorithm. Experimental results on a large corpus of Twitter data reveal multiple insights regarding demographic sentiment towards face masks that agree with existing surveys. Furthermore, we find two key policy-shift events contributed to statistically significant changes in sentiment for both Republicans and Democrats.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9378114","COVID-19;Twitter;Demographic Analysis;Sentiment Analysis;Offline C hange Point Detection","COVID-19;Social networking (online);Blogs;Time series analysis;Big Data;Resource management;Faces","data analysis;demography;health care;inference mechanisms;sentiment analysis;social networking (online);time series","face mask policy shifts;key policy-shift events;polarized public opinions;personal face mask usage;individual face mask usage;United States;multimodal demographic inference framework","","9","","23","","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The unique cold-start nature makes event recommendation more challenging than traditional recommendation problems, since even for two events with the same content, they may not happen at the same time, the same location, or be organized by the same host. Existing event recommendation algorithms mainly exploit the basic context information (e.g., location, time and content), while the social influence of event hosts and group members have been ignored. In this paper, we propose a Social Information Augmented Recommender System (SIARS), which fully exploits the social influence of event hosts and group members together with basic context information for event recommendation. In particular, we combine the information of EBSNs and other social networks to characterize the social influence of event hosts, and take interactions between group members into consideration for event recommendation. In addition, we propose a new content-aware recommendation model using the topic model to find the most similar topic the event belongs to, and a new location-aware recommendation model integrating location popularity with location distribution for event recommendation.

In prediction enhancement, we first exploit its advantages in extracting and analyzing the topic information between image samples and attributes by the LDA topic model. We then use a strategy to search the nearest neighbor image collection from test datasets by KNN. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy onHAT datasets and demonstrate significant improvement over the baseline algorithm.","2324-9013","978-1-5090-4906-6","10.1109/Trustcom/BigDataSE/ICESS.2017.324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029527","Attribute Prediction;Classification Adaptation;Prediction Enhancement","Predictive models;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Analytical models","feature extraction;image classification;image enhancement;support vector machines","precision-enhanced image attribute prediction model;object variations;scene variations;enhanced attribute prediction-latent Dirichlet allocation;EAP-LDA;classification adaptation;prediction enhancement;image low-level features;SVM classifiers;feature extraction;HAT datasets","","1","","20","","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While independence assumption contributes to its practicability, it loses the rich local information between words, which in some cases will result in incoherent topics. In this paper, we propose an enhanced PLSA model embedded with word correlation (EWPLSA) for text clustering. The new model can utilize a wide range of pairwise semantic constraints between words to get more meaningful topics. We study how to consider context information of all the words, trained with the global semantic distribution in a global manner. The relationship between similar words will be amplified in a global perspective in the next iteration. However, it will also be restricted by other words because all word contexts are considered. In this way, instead of generating independently, the topic assignment of each word is affected by other correlative words. In addition, we initialize several important parameters before the first iteration of the EM algorithm according to the local correlation information between words, leading to the reduction of iteration number. Experiments on two datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.","2161-4407","978-1-5090-6182-2","10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7966257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7966257","","Correlation;Semantics;Context;Clustering algorithms;Probabilistic logic;Optimization;Linear programming","iterative methods;pattern clustering;probability;text analysis","text clustering;word correlation;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;enhanced PLSA model embedded with word correlation;EWPLSA;pairwise semantic constraints;global semantic distribution;topic assignment;correlative words;EM algorithm;local correlation information;iteration number reduction","","1","","19","","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All the time series data are clustered. Each cluster of time series data, corresponding to a motion pattern, is modeled by an HMM. Our model postulates a set of HMMs that share a common set of states (topics in an analogy with topic models for document processing), but have unique transition distributions. The number of HMMs and the number of topics are both automatically determined. The sticky prior avoids redundant states and makes our HDP-HMM more effective to model multimodal observations. For the application to motion trajectory modeling, topics correspond to motion activities. The learnt topics are clustered into atomic activities which are assigned predicates. We propose a Bayesian inference method to decompose a given trajectory into a sequence of atomic activities. The sources and sinks in the scene are learnt by clustering endpoints (origins and destinations) of trajectories. The semantic motion regions are learnt using the points in trajectories. On combining the learnt sources and sinks, the learnt semantic motion regions, and the learnt sequence of atomic activities, the action represented by a trajectory can be described in natural language in as automatic a way as possible. The effectiveness of our dual sticky HDP-HMM is validated on several trajectory datasets.

Feature learning is an important issue in classification and data analysis. It can improve the classification performance and increase the convenience of data processing and analysis. Popular methods of representation learning include methods that are based on mixture models or dictionary learning methods. However, current methods have some disadvantages. The use of a traditional mixture model, such as the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), involves the model selection problem and suffers a lack of hierarchy between components. Inspired by h-LDA, distance-based Gaussian hierarchical Dirichlet allocation (distance-based GhLDA) is proposed herein. This method can automatically determine the number of components and construct a hierarchical representation. The distance function between data is used in the prior distribution. The learnt representation in the proposed model has the advantage of hLDA, which can handle shared components and distinct components. The quantization loss problem, which commonly arises when a topic model is used to deal with continuous data, can be solved by assuming that the distribution of words follows a Gaussian rather than a Dirichlet distribution. The performance of the proposed model in solving audio and image classification problems is evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the distance-based GhLDA outperforms baseline methods.","1051-4651","978-1-5386-3788-3","10.1109/ICPR.2018.8545305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8545305","","Data models;Mixture models;Hidden Markov models;Resource management;Vector quantization;Semantics","Bayes methods;data analysis;feature extraction;Gaussian processes;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);mixture models;quantisation (signal);signal processing","hierarchical latent semantic model;multimedia data;hierarchical feature representation;Bayesian nonparametric method;feature learning;classification performance;data processing;representation learning;Gaussian mixture model;model selection problem;distance-based Gaussian hierarchical Dirichlet allocation;distance-based GhLDA;distance function;quantization loss problem;Dirichlet distribution;image classification problems;baseline methods;data analysis;dictionary learning methods;GMM;audio classification problems","","","","21","","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Without having to explore the vast amount of information, it helps users to be aware of the trends around them. Trend detection methods introduced so far have not used the location matching feature thus lack integrating geographic locations information with the analyzed trend. To address this problem, this research aims at developing an Android mobile application, TrendSquare which uses LDA topic modeling algorithm to obtain location-specific trending tweets. This is not an exhaustive trend analysis of all services, because of the vast amount of tweets present; rather it is for picked services (Restaurants, Jewelry, Shopping malls, Textiles) where trend notifications to customers would serve as a prominent way of advertising and target marketing. An outstanding advantage of using LDA for Twitter trend detection is that it can well capture events with narrow topical scope. This implementation also provides us favorable results in the accuracy of trends obtained.","","978-1-5386-3702-9","10.1109/ICCTCT.2018.8551056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8551056","Twitter;Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA);Trend Detection;Android Mobile Application;Place picker API","Market research;Twitter;Conferences;Matrix converters;Performance evaluation;Information science","information analysis;mobile computing;social networking (online)","social networks;trend detection methods;Android mobile application;TrendSquare;LDA topic;location-specific trending tweets;trend notifications;Twitter trend detection;trend square;Android application;Twitter trends;geographic locations information;topical scope;trend analysis","","2","","13","","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One intuitive perspective towards the understanding would be to explore the potential functionality relevance of those choices. With a plethora of publicly hosted multi-language software projects available on GitHub, we were able to obtain thousands of popular, relevant repositories across 10 years from 2010 to 2019 to enable the exploration. We start by estimating the functionality domain of each project through topic modeling, followed by studying the statistical correlation between these domains and language selection over all the sample projects through association mining. We proceed with an evolutionary characterization of these projects to provide a longitudinal view of how the association has changed over the years.

First, based on the user multiple interest characteristics, a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) traditional text modeling method is applied into user behavior modeling. Taking the advantage of LDA topic model in dealing with the problem of polysemy and synonym, we can mine user latent interest distribution and analyze the effects of internal driving factors. Second, owing to the power-law characteristics of user behavior, LDA is improved by Gaussian weighting. In this way, the negative impact of the interest distribution to the high-frequency users can be reduced and the expression ability of interests can be enhanced. Furthermore, taking the impact of common neighbor dependencies in link establishment, the model can be extended with hidden naive Bayesian algorithm. By quantifying the dependencies between common neighbors, we can analyze the effects of external driving factors and combine internal driving factors to link prediction. Experimental results indicate that the model can not only mine user latent interest distribution but also can improve the performance of link prediction effectively.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2018.2812721","National Key Basic Research Program (973 program) of China(grant numbers:2013CB329606); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772098); Chongqing Youth Innovative Talent Project(grant numbers:cstc2013kjrc-qnrc40004); Science and Technology Research Program of the Chongqing Municipal Education Committee(grant numbers:KJ1500425); Chongqing Science and Technology Commission Project(grant numbers:cstc2017jcyjAX0099); Chongqing Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:cstc2017zdcy-zdyf0299,cstc2017zdcy-zdyf0436); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8320315","Hidden naive Bayes;latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA);latent interest;link prediction;social networks","Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Social network services;Bayes methods;Feature extraction;Analytical models;Data models","Bayes methods;pattern classification;social networking (online);text analysis","external driving factors;internal driving factors;three-level hidden Bayesian link prediction model;social networks;user behavior modeling;hidden naive Bayesian algorithm;latent Dirichlet allocation;LDA;text modeling;Gaussian weighting;3-HBP","","21","","50","IEEE","20 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Classifying Web services with similar functions is an effective method for service discovery and management. However, the functional description documents of Web services usually are short in their length, with sparse features and less information, which makes most topic models unable to model the short text well, consequently affecting the Web service classification. To solve this problem, a Web service classification method based on Wide & Bi-LSTM model is proposed in this paper. In this method, first, all the discrete features in the description documents of Web services are combined to perform the breadth prediction of Web service category by exploiting the wide learning model. Second, the word order and context information of the words in the description documents of Web services are mined by using the Bi-LSTM model to perform the depth prediction of the Web service category. Third, it uses the linear regression algorithm to integrate the breadth and depth prediction results of Web service categories as the final result of the service classification. Finally, compared with six Web service classification methods based on TF-IDF, LDA, WE-LDA, LSTM, Wide&Deep, and Bi-LSTM, respectively, the experimental results show that our approach achieves a better performance in the accuracy of Web service classification.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907546","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61873316,61872139,61702181); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2017JJ2098,2018JJ2136,2018JJ2139); Educational Commission of Hunan Province of China(grant numbers:17C0642); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8674750","Wide learning model;Bi-LSTM model;linear regression;web service classification","Web services;Predictive models;Context modeling;Feature extraction;Training;Data mining;Semantics","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis;Web services","Web services discovery;service discovery;Web service classification method;Web service category;Bi-LSTM model;Internet;linear regression algorithm;TF-IDF;WE-LDA;LSTM","","17","","31","OAPA","26 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the past, various approaches aim at recommending Web services for automatic Mashup creation have been proposed, i.e., TFIDF, collaborative filtering and topic model-based methods, which rely on the original service descriptions given by service providers. However, most traditional methods fail to capture the function-related features of services since words contained in service descriptions usually correspond to different intent aspects (e.g., functional and non-functional related). To tackle this problem, we propose a tag attention-based recurrent neural networks model for Web service recommendation. The model consists of two Siamese bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which jointly learn two embeddings representing the functional features of Web services and the functional requirements of Mashups. In addition, by considering the tags of services as functional context information, the model can learn to assign attention scores to different words in service descriptions according to their intent importance, thus words used to reveal the functional properties of Web service will be given special attention. We compare our approach with the state-of-the-art methods (e.g., RTM, Word2vec, etc.) on a real-world dataset crawled from ProgrammableWeb, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-1985-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8852438","Tags;Web Services;Mashup;Recommendation;Long Short-Term Memory;Neural Network","Mashups;Quality of service;Computer architecture;Recurrent neural networks;Semantics","learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems;recurrent neural nets;service-oriented architecture;Web services","service-oriented architecture;automatic Mashup creation;Web services;tag attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory;value-added mashup applications;tag attention-based recurrent neural network model;Siamese bidirectional long short-term memory networks;ProgrammableWeb;functional context information;Web service recommendation","","4","","27","","30 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These reviews contain not only the user comments on different aspects of the products but also the user sentiments associated with the aspects. Although these user sentiments serve as vital side information for improving the performance of recommender systems, most existing approaches ignore to fully exploit them in modeling the fine-grained user-item interaction for improving recommender system performance. Thus, this paper proposes a sentiment-aware deep recommender system with neural attention network (SDRA), which can capture both the aspects of products and the underlying user sentiments associated with the aspects for improving the recommendation system performance. Particularly, a semi-supervised topic model is designed to extract the aspects of the product and the associated sentiment lexicons from the user textual reviews, which are then incorporated into a long short term memory (LSTM) encoder via an interactive neural attention mechanism for better learning of the user and item sentiment-aware representation. Furthermore, a co-attention mechanism is introduced to better model the fine-grained user-item interaction for improving predictive performance.

A comparative study over different features and regression models toward short-answer grading has been performed with respect to evaluation metrics used in evaluating ASAG. Apart from traditional text similarity based features like WordNet similarity, latent semantic analysis, and others, we have introduced novel features like topic models suited for short text, relevance feedback based features. An ensemble-based model has been built using a combination of different regression models with an approach based on stacked regression. The proposed ASAG has been tested on the University of North Texas dataset for the regression task, whereas in case of classification task, the student response analysis (SRA) based ScientsBank and Beetle corpus have been used for evaluation. The grading performance in case of ensemble-based ASAG is highly boosted from that exhibited by an individual regression model.

Currently, Wikipedia has a human-driven process in place to identify online abuse. In this paper, we propose a framework to understand and detect such abuse in the English Wikipedia community. We analyze the publicly available data sources provided by Wikipedia. We discover that Wikipedia's XML dumps require extensive computing power to be used for temporal textual analysis, and, as an alternative, we propose a web scraping methodology to extract user-level data and perform extensive exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of users who have been blocked for abusive behavior in the past. With these data, we develop an abuse detection model that leverages Natural Language Processing techniques, such as character and word n-grams, sentiment analysis and topic modeling, and generates features that are used as inputs in a model based on machine learning algorithms to predict abusive behavior. Our best abuse detection model, using XGBoost Classifier, gives us an AUC of ~84%.","","978-1-7281-0998-5","10.1109/SIEDS.2019.8735592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735592","Machine Learning;Natural Language Processing;Online Abuse;Text Mining","Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet;XML;Feature extraction;Data models","behavioural sciences;data analysis;data mining;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;social aspects of automation;text analysis;Web sites;XML","online abuse;online communities;English Wikipedia community;user-level data;extensive exploratory data analysis;abusive behavior;abuse detection model;Wikipedia XML dumps;web scraping methodology","","2","","16","","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, text mining is being widely used for locating features or concerns in a large complex software system. Nevertheless, the literature study reveals that combining text mining with other techniques always yield better accuracy in locating features. Even though it is efficient, applying formal concept analysis on the large systems poses limitation due to its exponential time complexity in constructing concept lattices. In this research work, a model is devised to combine text mining and concept mining for large systems. The unsupervised machine learning technique, Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling also called as Topic Modeling is used to reduce the feature space on which K-Means clustering is applied to cluster the related documents and formal concept analysis is carried out on individual clusters.

It helps to establish a variety of intelligent personalized services, such as fast-launch UI app, intelligent user-phone interactions, and so on. Since app names only provide limited semantic information, the intrinsic relation among apps cannot be fully exploited. Meanwhile, next-app to be used is largely determined by a sequence of apps that a user used recently. To address these challenging problems, this paper first enriches the semantic information of apps by extracting descriptive text of each app from the app store and thus proposes a topic model to transform apps as well as user preferences into latent vectors. Then, a set of nearest neighbors can be constructed based on the similarity of latent vectors and it is employed for training the prediction model. Furthermore, our prediction scheme is built on the temporal sequential data and is modeled by using the chain-augmented Naive Bayes model.

Nevertheless, when the linear mixtures are distorted by unknown nonlinear functions - which is well-motivated and more realistic in many cases - the associated identifiability issues are far less studied. This work focuses on parameter identification of a nonlinear mixture model that is motivated by a number of real-world applications, e.g., hyperspectral imaging and magnetic resonance imaging.

The rapid increase in multimedia data transmission over the Internet necessitates multi-modal summarization (MMS) from asynchronous collections of text, image, audio, and video. In this work, we propose an extractive MMS method that unites the techniques of NLP, speech processing, and computer vision to explore the rich information contained in multi-modal data and to improve the quality of multimedia news summarization. The key idea is to bridge the semantic gaps between multi-modal content. Audio and visual are main modalities in the video. For audio information, we design an approach to selectively use its transcription and to infer the salience of the transcription with audio signals. For visual information, we learn the joint representations of text and images using a neural network. Then, we capture the coverage of the generated summary for important visual information through text-image matching or multi-modal topic modeling. Finally, all the multi-modal aspects are considered to generate a textual summary by maximizing the salience, non-redundancy, readability, and coverage through the budgeted optimization of submodular functions.

As predicted by prior theory, we find that knowledge boundaries emerge as the group faces increasingly challenging problems. Beyond this theory, we find that knowledge boundaries cease to structure communications between communities of practice when the group's expert ability is insufficient to solve its task, such as in the presence of high novelty. We conjecture that the amount of expert knowledge that the group can collectively bring to bear is a determining factor in boundary formation. This implies that some of the factors underlying knowledge boundary formation may aid-rather than hinder-knowledge aggregation.

To assist users in policy decisions, relevant efforts have been focusing on leveraging contexts to capture users' privacy preferences. However, these techniques have various limitations, such as heavily relying on users' historical decisions on granting permissions, ignoring the fact that users are not experts on privacy protection, and hard to determine whether a permission shall be granted. To address this problem, we propose an autonomous permission recommendation system, AutoPer+, to automatically recommend users the permission decisions at runtime. The main insight of our proposed system is that the natural language description of an app reflects its functionality and its similarity to other apps, and thus can be used to analyze whether a permission is needed indeed by it, and the apps similar to it. First, we introduce a multi-topic model into app functionality mining, and design a topic-permission mapper for the proposed recommendation system. Then we propose a deep semi-supervised machine using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to identify similar apps, by which we can explore privacy permission usage in a cluster of apps. Finally, we capture a trade-off between privacy and utility to present a systematic recommendation. In addition to the permission decision (“Allow” or “Deny”), the permission explanations are also provided for users to make decisions (called “Ask”). We evaluate the proposed system via extensive comparison experiments on 31,023 Android apps. The results show that our approach achieves an accuracy of 84.1%. Moreover, we conduct user studies via installing AutoPer+ in the participants' own Android devices.

LDA solutions can be used as either a clustering solution or a low-dimensional document representation. The low-dimensional space obtained by LDA is normally called semantic space, as alternative forms expressing the same concept or topic are projected to a common representation. In this work, we discuss the problem of document organization in different levels of semantic complexity and evaluate the use of LDA for document organization in a real-world application scenario. Our hypothesis is that LDA achieves good results when documents can be organized based on the vocabulary only, however, LDA semantic space is not semantically rich enough to allow an organization in more complex scenarios. We developed a proof of concept to give evidence to this hypothesis and evaluate the use of LDA in two different approaches: as an exclusive partitional clustering solution and as a dimension reduction method. The solutions were evaluated based on both FScore measure and user's expectations, considering document organization problems with different levels of semantic requirements. The results indicate that LDA reached good FScore if the organization depends mainly on the document vocabulary, but the method was not able to help the discovery of patterns that is semantically more complex.","","978-1-5386-2726-6","10.1109/SSCI.2017.8280939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8280939","","Semantics;Complexity theory;Vocabulary;Companies;Text mining;Task analysis","data mining;document handling;pattern clustering;text analysis","LDA semantic space;complex scenarios;exclusive partitional clustering solution;document organization problems;document vocabulary;latent dirichlet allocation;semantic complexity;state-of-the-art topic;text mining tasks;LDA solutions;low-dimensional document representation","","2","","20","","5 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The concept of granularity is employed here for extracting contextual information from the documents by generating granules of words (GoWs), hierarchically. In a novel computationally efficient w ay, the proposed Granularity Based Word Grouping (GBWG) algorithm exploits the co-occurrence between the words of different granules to group the contextually related words, representing different topics. However, the topics are coarsely generated, containing common words. A Graph-based method has been proposed to precisely identify the topics using the Louvain graph clustering algorithm.

"Examining the Characteristics of Practical Knowledge From Four Public Facebook Communities of Practice in Instructional Design and Technology","J. Leung","School of Information Science and Learning Technologies, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA","IEEE Access","5 Sep 2022","2022","10","","90669","90689","Instructional design and technology (IDT) professionals participate in communities of practice (CoPs) on Facebook to seek pedagogical and educational technology advice for solving instructional design (ID) problems. Much of the IDT literature has focused on formal educational environments and not on nonformal settings outside the classroom and beyond formal education. Further analysis of tacit or practical knowledge exchanged among community members is required to understand the purpose, functions, and organizational knowledge capital in online CoPs. To fill this gap, this study uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the practical knowledge of 6,066 anonymized users’ posts from four large public IDT CoPs on Facebook from September 2017 to September 2020 after cleaning the dataset. User posts were publicly available and required no password authentication for access, including Instructional Designer (4,717), Designers for Learning (228), Adobe Captivate Users (599), and Articulate Storyline (522). The proposed methodology aims to extract practical knowledge of individual online CoPs in three parts. First, the characteristics of written communication among members are extracted by calculating word and sentence lengths, word frequencies, and contiguous words. Second, the characteristics of members’ exchange of practical knowledge are obtained through sentiment identification, entity recognition, and relationships between pedagogical and educational technology entities. Third, the functions of individual online CoPs are developed through topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and BERTopic. The findings suggest similarities and differences among IDT CoPs, different resource distribution conventions, and members exchanging pedagogical and educational technology advice. The study highlights the need for pedagogical foundations to support instructional and technical decisions, mechanisms for self-assessment of practical knowledge concerning IDT competencies, community protocols for addressing misconceptions about learning, onboarding materials for new members, and new topic structures to classify practical knowledge. NLP tasks are implemented using Python libraries to support the future development of awareness tools.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3201893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9867996","Data mining;instructional design;online learning;communities of practice;social media","Social networking (online);Data mining;Electronic learning;Syntactics;Semantics;Pandemics;Online services;Computer aided instruction;Design methodology;Educational technology","computer aided instruction;knowledge management;natural language processing;social networking (online)","educational technology entities;individual online CoPs;pedagogical technology advice;educational technology advice;practical knowledge;public Facebook communities;instructional design problems;public IDT CoPs;Instructional Designer;pedagogical technology entities","","","","117","CCBY","26 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A professional peer review process ensures the quality of the produced scientific research work. However, there are two main challenges to achieve professional peer review: (1) selecting reviewers with similar competences as the authors (peers) of a submitted research work and (2) resolving any Conflict of Interest (Col) between reviewers and authors. Currently, to solve the first challenge, editors and conferences organizers select reviewers manually. Similarly, the current solution of the second challenge is that authors and reviewers are asked to manually declare any CoI. Such a manual solution is error-prone, waste time, and tedious for reviewers, authors, editors, and organizers. To address the aforementioned two challenges, we have developed a novel recommender system that (1) suggests expert reviewers and (2) resolves any CoI between the recommended reviewers and the author(s) of a submitted paper. To develop our recommender system, we utilized the DBLP citation network database represented as Linked Open Data. To select candidate reviewers who are expert in the topic of a submitted paper without CoIs, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to extract the topics researchers are working on and the topics of a submitted paper, then our system executes a SPARQL query that returns the best candidate reviewers. Finally, our system executes another SPARQL query that detects any CoIs between the candidate reviewers and the authors of a submitted paper and hence excludes them. Our experimental evaluations corroborate the ability or our system to recommend expert reviewers without CoIs.","","978-1-7281-2946-4","10.1109/SNAMS.2019.8931826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8931826","Conflict of Interests (CoIs);Knowledge Representation;Linked Open Data (LOD);SPARQL;DBLP;OWL;RDF;Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA);Apache Jena Fuseki","Recommender systems;Resource description framework;Semantics;Social networking (online);Feature extraction;Collaboration","citation analysis;human factors;multimedia computing;query processing;recommender systems;social networking (online)","Linked Open Data;qualified researchers;professional peer review process;scientific research work;submitted research work;CoI;recommender system;expert reviewers;recommended reviewers;candidate reviewers;topics researchers","","","","32","","16 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The developed techniques have also gained widespread use in various domains with good success, such as automatic speech recognition, information retrieval and text classification, etc. Among them, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are well suited to such tasks, which can capture long-range dependencies among words efficiently, meanwhile alleviating the gradient vanishing or exploding problem during training effectively. Following this line of research, in this paper we explore a novel use of a Siamese LSTM based method to learn more accurate document representation for text categorization. Such a network architecture takes a pair of documents with variable lengths as the input and utilizes pairwise learning to generate distributed representations of documents that can more precisely render the semantic distance between any pair of documents. In doing so, documents associated with the same semantic or topic label could be mapped to similar representations having a relatively higher semantic similarity. Experiments conducted on two benchmark text categorization tasks, viz. IMDB and 20Newsgroups, show that using a three-layer deep neural network based classifier that takes a document representation learned from the Siamese LSTM sub-networks as the input can achieve competitive performance in relation to several state-of-the-art methods.","","978-1-5386-1542-3","10.1109/APSIPA.2017.8282104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8282104","","Semantics;Text categorization;Training;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Task analysis;Logic gates","learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture;pattern classification;speech recognition;text analysis","Siamese LSTM networks;deep learning;artificial intelligence community;automatic speech recognition;information retrieval;text classification;short-term memory networks;long-range dependencies;network architecture;variable lengths;distributed representations;semantic distance;benchmark text categorization tasks;three-layer deep neural network;document representation;semantic similarity","","10","","32","","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, user profiles which only contain a user's past annotation information may not be enough to support the selection of expansion terms, especially for users with limited previous activity with the system. We propose a novel model to construct enriched user profiles with the help of an external corpus for personalized query expansion.

Methods for embedding text can vary significantly within the literature, highlighting the lack of a consensus as to which approaches are best able to cluster user feedback into requirements relevant groups. This work proposes a methodology for comparing text embeddings of user feedback using existing labelled datasets. Using 7 diverse datasets from the literature, we apply this methodology to evaluate both established text embedding techniques from the user feedback analysis literature (including topic modelling and word embeddings) as well as text embeddings from state of the art deep text embedding models. Results demonstrate that text embeddings produced by state of the art models, most notably the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), group feedback with similar requirements relevant characteristics together better than other evaluated techniques across all seven datasets.

When compared between the two techniques, Text Classification provides outputs with higher accuracy level. Due to this Data analysts tend to move towards this technique. Text classification is also referred to as text categorization/tagging, and it is a task of categorizing text according to its specified class. Text classifiers can automatically examine a set of text and classify it under a pre-defined category according to the content of the set of text with the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP) [1]. As this is a Supervised learning, it requires a vast range of classified dataset to make the classification efficient. But when it comes to languages with scarcity of classified dataset such as Sinhala, it becomes a problem to train the model due to the insufficiency of the dataset. Thus, the author proposes a solution for performing Text classification using Active learning.

The multiplicity of available data can alleviate this burden by offering an informed avenue for comprehension. Parsing these data sources for relevant information is a time intensive and academically challenging task. Our research looks to explore the practicality of parsing these sources of data by attempting to surface latent cultural structures from organized texts. By analyzing sources that heavily rely on nationalistic subtexts, our research looks to find non-obvious sentiment on latent cultural events and topics that would typically require dedicated research to discover and dissect. The two data sources this work considers are nationalist journalistic efforts: An Phoblacht and TamilNet. We explore different paradigms for latent variable discovery in textual data, including topic modeling and word embedding, and synthesize them with sentiment analysis to produce a composite model for discovering and classifying unseen cultural context within the text. We pay additional consideration to evaluating how these composite models shift over time, and what implications this holds for identifying patterns of reaction for these populations. Our exploratory results show predicted latent cultural structures within the text, while our time series analysis indicates several outliers in the usage of language that indicate potential latent cultural perspectives.","","978-1-5386-1848-6","10.1109/SIEDS.2017.7937744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7937744","Event Detection;Joint Sentiment Models;Nationalist Discourse;Natural Language Processing","Cultural differences;Data models;Text mining;Dictionaries;Analytical models;Sentiment analysis;Vocabulary","sentiment analysis;time series","event detection;joint sentiment models;latent cultural structure assessment;nationalist text;time series analysis;natural language processing","","","","9","","1 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is constructed by extracting texts indicating causal relationships from the texts of financial statement summaries. A previous study showed there is a lead-lag effect that spreads to the ’effect’ stock group when a large stock price fluctuation in the ’cause’ stock group in the causal chain occurs. However, there is room for extracting a more robust lead-lag relationship by giving sentiment to the economic causal chain. The SSESTM (Supervised Sentiment Extraction via Screening and Topic Modeling) model has been proposed as a sentiment analysis specialized for stock return forecasting, and it produced a substantial profit in the U.S. and Japanese stock markets.

Along this line, we propose CAMEL, a novel topic model for complementary aspect-based opinion mining across asymmetric collections. CAMEL gains information complementarity by modeling both common and specific aspects across collections, while keeping all the corresponding opinions for contrastive study. An auto-labeling scheme called AME is also proposed to help discriminate between aspect and opinion words without elaborative human labeling, which is further enhanced by adding word embedding-based similarity as a new feature. Moreover, CAMEL-DP, a nonparametric alternative to CAMEL is also proposed based on coupled Dirichlet Processes. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-collection reviews data demonstrate the superiority of our methods to competitive baselines.

However, as the hashtag generation process is less restrictive, it throws several challenges, such as hashtag normalization, topic modeling, and semantic similarity. Recently, researchers have tried to address the above-mentioned challenges through representation learning. However, most of the studies on hashtag embedding try to capture the semantic distribution of hashtags and often fail to capture the sentiment polarity. Furthermore, generating a task-specific hashtag embedding can distort its semantic representation, which is undesirable for sentiment representation of hashtag. Therefore, this article proposes a semisupervised sentiment hashtag embedding (SHE) model, which is capable of preserving both semantic as well as sentiment distribution of the hashtags. In particular, SHE leverages a multitask learning approach using an autoencoder and a convolutional neural network-based classifier. To assess the efficacy of hashtag embedding, we compare the performance of SHE against suitable baselines for three different tasks, namely, hashtag sentiment classification, tweet sentiment classification, and retrieval of semantically similar hashtags. It is evident from various experimental results that SHE outperforms the majority of the baselines with significant margins.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2019.2962718","Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8963749","Hashtag embedding;sentiment analysis;sentiment lexicon","Twitter;Tagging;Semantics;Task analysis;Decoding;Encoding;Training","convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","multitask learning;sentiment analysis task;social media data;hashtag generation process;hashtag normalization;semantic similarity;representation learning;semantic distribution;sentiment polarity;task-specific hashtag embedding;semantic representation;semisupervised sentiment hashtag embedding;sentiment distribution;tweet sentiment classification;autoencoder;convolutional neural network-based classifier","","10","","26","IEEE","20 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A generative topic model quantifies the posterior probability of calibration parameters conditioned on local 2-D image features arising from a generic underlying substrate. Auto-calibration is achieved by identifying the maximum a-posteriori image-to-probe transform, and calibration quality is assessed online in terms of the posterior probability of the current image-to-probe transform. Both are closely linked to the 3-D point reconstruction error (PRE) in aligning feature observations arising from the same underlying physical structure in different US images. The method is of practical importance in that it operates simply by scanning arbitrary textured echogenic structures, e.g., in-vivo tissues in the context of the US-guided procedures, without requiring specialized calibration procedures or equipment. Observed data take the form of local scale-invariant features that can be extracted and fit to the model in near real-time. Experiments demonstrate the method on a public data set of in vivo human brain scans of 14 unique subjects acquired in the context of neurosurgery. Online calibration assessment can be performed at approximately 3 Hz for the US images of 640 × 480 pixels. Auto-calibration achieves an internal mean PRE of 1.2 mm and a discrepancy of [2 mm, 6 mm] in comparison to the calibration via a standard phantom-based method.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2017.2750978","NIH(grant numbers:R01CA138419,P41EB015902,P41EB015898); Canadian National Sciences and Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8031042","Bayes methods;calibration;computational and artificial intelligence;feature extraction;image processing;image reconstruction;statistical learning;ultrasonic imaging","Calibration;Probes;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Transforms;Target tracking","biological tissues;biomedical ultrasonics;brain;calibration;feature extraction;image reconstruction;maximum likelihood estimation;medical image processing","phantomless auto-calibration;online calibration assessment;tracked freehand 2D ultrasound probe;natural tissues;calibration phantom;a-posteriori image-to-probe transform;3D point reconstruction error;PRE;arbitrary textured echogenic structures;local scale-invariant feature extraction;in vivo human brain scans;neurosurgery","Brain;Calibration;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Ultrasonography","8","","42","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many kinds of PolSAR features can be extracted for PolSAR image classification, such as the scattering, polarimetric or image features. However, it is difficult to improve the classification accuracy of PolSAR images by using all these low-level features directly, since they may conflict with each other for classification. Hence, how to joint learn these low-level features to obtain high-level discriminating features is a challenging task. To solve this problem, a novel fast multi-feature joint learning method(fMF-JLC) is proposed for PolSAR image classification. The proposed method extract three kinds of low-level features of PolSAR data at first. Then, a multi-feature joint sparse representation model(MF-JSR) is proposed by designing joint sparse constraints on the extracted features above. Moreover, the joint sparse features are further compressed to overcome the dimension curse and acquire semantic features by the topic model. By this way, the low-level features are fused and discriminating high-level features are acquired. However, the pixel-wise feature learning method is time consuming. To speed the proposed method, a superpixel-based fast learning method is designed by involving the contextual relationship. Experiments are taken on three sets of real PolSAR data with different sensors and bands, and several compared methods are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can obtain better performance than the state-of-art methods, especially for the heterogenous areas.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973246","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2013CB329402); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61113090,61472319,61703333,61502382); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2018JQ6055,2019JQ-740); Research Project of Shaanxi Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:19JK0566); Technology Innovation Project of Xi’an University of Technology(grant numbers:112/256081620); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8994163","Polarimetric SAR classification;joint multi-feature sparse representation;joint multi-feature learning;fast classification method","Feature extraction;Scattering;Learning systems;Data mining;Semantics;Synthetic aperture radar;Matrix decomposition","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image fusion;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);radar imaging;radar polarimetry;synthetic aperture radar","fast polarimetric SAR terrain classification;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar;PolSAR image processing;PolSAR features;PolSAR image classification;image features;PolSAR images;low-level features;high-level discriminating features;PolSAR data;multifeature joint sparse representation model;joint sparse features;semantic features;high-level features;pixel-wise feature learning method;superpixel-based fast learning method;multifeature joint learning method;MF-JSR;fMF-JLC","","5","","55","CCBY","11 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previously, the research attention in this field is attracted by topic models and multi-label classification approaches, but they don't fully capture the correlations of labels and achieve very promising performance. Alternatively, we problematic it as a machine translation problem, that the source sentence is formed by symptoms and the target sentence consists of herbs. Two sentences are both in weakly order. In terms of this assumption, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) architecture, namely TCM translator, to translate symptoms to herbs. Seq2seq, consisting of an encoder and a decoder, is a well known framework for resolving the machine translation problem in natural language processing (NLP) community. It maps a bag of symptoms to the latent space, which is decoded to the target sentence, i.e., herbs. In this paper, transformer is used as our encoder to explore the latent correlations of symptoms and LSTM is implemented as the decoder to generate the herbs sequentially. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective and outperforms other baseline models by a substantial margin.","","978-1-7281-1867-3","10.1109/BIBM47256.2019.8983384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8983384","traditional Chinese medicine;herbal prescription;deep learning;machine translation;sequence-to-sequence","","data mining;language translation;medical computing;medicine;natural language processing;patient treatment;pattern classification","herbal medicines;traditional Chinese medicine;herbal prescriptions;clinical practice;machine translation problem;sequence-to-sequence architecture;seq2seq;TCM translator;natural language processing community;sequence generation approach;prescription development","","4","","46","","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modeling such relatedness is, nevertheless, unavoidable for any efficient and effective anomaly detection system, given the intricate topological and nonlinear connections that are originally unknown among sensors. Furthermore, detecting anomalies in multivariate time series is difficult due to their temporal dependency and stochasticity. This article presented GTA, a new framework for multivariate time-series anomaly detection that involves automatically learning a graph structure, graph convolution, and modeling temporal dependency using a transformer-based architecture. The connection learning policy, which is based on the Gumbel-softmax sampling approach to learn bidirected links among sensors directly, is at the heart of the learning graph structure. To describe the anomaly information flow between network nodes, we introduced a new graph convolution called influence propagation convolution. In addition, to tackle the quadratic complexity barrier, we suggested a multibranch attention mechanism to replace the original multihead self-attention method.

In addition, the relationships among the keywords are often difficult to obtain. In this paper, we utilize the attention scores extracted from Transformer-based language models to capture word relationships. We propose a domain-driven attention tuning method, guiding the attention to learn domain-specific word relationships. From the attention, we build a keyword network and propose a novel algorithm, Attention-based Word Influence (AWI), to compute how influential each word is in the network. An interactive visual analytics system, KeywordMap, is developed to support multi-level analysis of keywords and keyword relationships through coordinated views. We measure the quality of keywords captured by our AWI algorithm quantitatively. We also evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of KeywordMap through case studies.","2165-8773","978-1-6654-3931-2","10.1109/PacificVis52677.2021.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438768","Text/Document Data;Machine Learning;Task and Requirements Analysis","Analytical models;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Visual analytics;Interactive systems;Classification algorithms;Data mining","data analysis;data visualisation;feature extraction;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","KeywordMap;visual exploration;text data;multifaceted properties;keyword analysis algorithms;hyper-parameters;attention scores;Transformer-based language models;domain-driven attention tuning method;domain-specific word relationships;keyword network;Attention-based Word Influence;interactive visual analytics system;multilevel analysis;keyword relationships;AWI algorithm","","","","49","","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such process capability and efficiency might be affected and limited by the available computational resources and the consequent power consumption. Conventional search mechanisms are often incapable of real-time fetching a predefined content from data source, without concerning the increased number of connected devices that contribute to the same source. In this work, we propose and present a concept for an efficient approach for online content searching, takes advantage of a) the structure of data profiling employed at the related data source; and b) the learning algorithms that are used for extracting its common features and for generating a map of indices to data contents. This enables instant mapping of users requests to make the process as realtime as possible. The adopted learning algorithms main blocks are built to capture the semantic features in the targeted context of data sentences. We reviewed several learning approaches and compared their results based on the criteria of capturing the semantic features that appeared through the preliminary results. The preliminary results conclusively confirmed that employing the weighted recurrent neural networks and the GloVE pre-trained model paired with NMF topic modeling, yielded highly acceptable levels of Fl-score and prediction time.","","978-1-7281-8420-3","10.1109/GCAIoT51063.2020.9345816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345816","Online Search;Machine Learning;Content-on-Demand;Real-time Searching;Context Extraction","Semantics;Text categorization;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Data mining;Task analysis","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","learning algorithms;data contents;algorithms main blocks;semantic features;targeted context;data sentences;learning approaches;prediction time;Towards Intelligent Web Context-Based Content On-Demand Extraction;deep learning;information extraction;massive high-dimensional data;dynamic contexts;real-time basis;process capability;available computational resources;consequent power consumption;conventional search mechanisms;predefined content;connected devices;online content searching;related data source","","","","15","","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present an analysis tool comprising various GPU-based visualization techniques to explore such complex GMMs. To facilitate the exploration of high-dimensional data, we provide a novel navigation system to analyze the underlying data. Instead of projecting the data to 2D, we utilize interactive 3D views to better support users in understanding the spatial arrangements of the Gaussian distributions. The interactive system is composed of two parts: (1) raycasting-based views that visualize cluster memberships, spatial arrangements, and support the discovery of new modes. (2) overview visualizations that enable the comparison of Gaussians with each other, as well as small multiples of different choices of basis vectors.

In this article, we present a survey of existing multispectral and SAR land cover image datasets. To this end, we demonstrate how an advanced SAR image analysis system can be designed, implemented, and verified that is capable of generating semantically annotated classification results (e.g., maps) as well as local and regional statistical analytics such as graphical charts. The initial classification is made based on Gabor features and followed by class assignments (labeling). This is followed by inclusion. This can be accomplished by the inclusion of expert knowledge via active learning with selected examples, and the extraction of additional knowledge from public databases to refine the classification results. Then, based on the generated semantics, we can create new topic models, find typical country-specific phenomena and distributions, visualize them interactively, and present significant examples including confusion matrices. This semiautomated and flexible methodology allows several annotation strategies, the inclusion of dedicated analytics procedures, and can generate broad as well as detailed semantic (multi-)labels for all continents, and statistics or models for selected countries and cities. Here, we employ knowledge graphs and exploit ontologies. These components could already be validated successfully.

They are often used as data to analyze what is trending in the community. However, topic modeling or text clustering algorithms on short text have some unique problems. Namely, sparsity which is caused by too many unique words only appear in few documents, and a lack of word co-occurrences that makes it difficult for the system to find semantic information of words. To overcome those 2 problems, we propose a novel method to use the word embedding technique to represent the document in vector space. FastText and BERT embedding models are chosen not only because of the quality of their text representation but also their ability to handle out of vocabulary words. As for clustering, the HDBSCAN algorithm is used because of its ability to handle noise. However, it has poor performance on clustering high-dimensional data. Because vectors resulting from word embedding are high-dimensional, therefore dimension reduction by UMAP is done on the vectors before feeding it to HDBSCAN. The experimental results prove that our novel method is better than the baseline, which is evaluated on purity and NMI metrics.","","978-1-6654-1743-3","10.1109/ICAICTA53211.2021.9640285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9640285","short text;text clustering;word embedding;dimension reduction","Measurement;Dimensionality reduction;Vocabulary;Social networking (online);Semantics;Blogs;Bit error rate","","","","","","19","","16 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A popular solution is to extract meaningful low-dimensional embeddings as short text representation via various Dimensionality Reduction technology. However, the existing methods, such as topic models and neural networks, discover low-dimensional embeddings from the whole training sets without considering the geometrical information of short text manifold, resulting in an inability to provide a discriminative embedding of short text. In this paper, we propose a manifold-regularized method, namely Short Texts Embedding AutoEncoders (STE-AEs), aiming to incorporate the semantics from the neighborhood into a regularization training of AutoEncoders (AEs) to extract discriminative low-dimensional short text embeddings. STE-AEs first determines semantics neighborhood via an attention-based weighted matching distance and then preserves the local geometrical structure by incorporating a minimization of the weighted cross-entropy of nearby texts' embeddings into a regularization training of AEs. Finally, the encoder can act as a parametrized mapping function between observations and embeddings. Furthermore, based on the activation values of the encoder for the training set, STE-AEs employs a regression model of Random Forest (RF) to determine the feature importance so as to find certain informative and readable words for embeddings interpretation. Through extensive experiments on three real-world short text corpuses, the evidence demonstrate that STE-AEs can capture the intrinsic discriminative explanatory factors, improving the performance of short text clustering and classification. Moreover, some understandable words can be efficiently discovered to promote the interpretability of low-dimensional embeddings.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3042778","Postdoctoral Science Foundation Granted of China(grant numbers:2019M650804); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284562","Short text representation;low-dimensional embeddings;manifold-regularized AutoEncoders;attention-based weighted matching","Semantics;Manifolds;Training;Knowledge based systems;Internet;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing","entropy;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern clustering;regression analysis;text analysis","short text embedding autoencoders;manifold-regularized method;discriminative embedding;short text manifold;dimensionality reduction technology;short text representation;attention-based neighborhood preservation;low-dimensional embeddings;classification;short text clustering;real-world short text corpuses;embeddings interpretation;attention-based weighted matching distance;STE-AEs;low-dimensional short text embeddings;regularization training","","","","51","CCBY","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Achieving computer network intrusion detection with these IDSs requires high-level information technology and security expertise because malicious traffic has to be rigorously analyzed and the appropriate IDS rules written to effectively detect vulnerabilities that may potentially be exploited. However, incorrect IDS rules may produce numerous false positives, thereby degrading the performance of the IDS, and even worse, paralyzing the network. In this paper, we present a novel approach that exploits the Latent Dirichle Allocation (LDA) algorithm to generate IDS rules. Our proposed method, called LDA-based Automatic Rule Generation (LARGen), automatically performs an analysis of the malicious traffic and extracts the appropriate attack signatures that will be used for IDS rules. LARGen first extracts multiple signature strings embedded in network flows. Then, the flows are classified based on the extracted signature strings, and key content strings for malicious traffic are identified through the LDA inferential topic model. Those key content strings are the core of an IDS rule that can detect malicious traffic. We study the effectiveness of LDA in the context of network attack signature generation via extensive experiments with real network trace data, consisting of both benign and malicious traffic. Experimental results confirm that threat rules generated from LARGen accurately detect every cyber attack with high accuracy.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2016.2609907","Korea National University of Transportation; Basic Science Research Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)(grant numbers:NRF-2014R1A1A2053456); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7569096","Intrusion detection system;automated threat rule generation;latent Dirichlet allocation;system design and implementation","Malware;Security;Resource management;Context;Internet;Protocols;Semantics","computer network security;digital signatures;invasive software","LARGen;Latent dirichlet Allocation;network threats;Intrusion Detection Systems;high-level information technology;malicious traffic;Automatic Rule Generation;key content strings;network trace data;automatic signature generation;computer network intrusion detection;IDS rules;attack signatures;malwares;signature strings","","17","","56","IEEE","15 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Whereas on Discord we found a negligible level of deception, on Telegram we retrieved 296 channels involved in pump-and-dump and 432 involved in Ponzi schemes, accounting for a striking 20% of the total. Moreover, we observed that 93% of the invite links shared by Twitter bots point to Telegram pump-and-dump channels, shedding light on a little-known social bot activity.

Currently, in the field of knowledge engineering, knowledge graphs, especially domain knowledge graphs, play important roles and become the infrastructure of Internet knowledge-driven intelligent applications. Domain concept extraction is critical to the construction of domain knowledge graphs. Although there have been some works that have extracted concepts, semantic information has not been fully used. However, the excellent concept extraction results can be obtained by making full use of semantic information. In this article, a novel concept extraction method, Semantic Graph-Based Concept Extraction (SGCCE), is proposed. First, the similarities between terms are calculated using the word co-occurrence, the LDA topic model and Word2Vec. Then, a semantic graph of terms is constructed based on the similarities between the terms. Finally, according to the semantic graph of the terms, community detection algorithms are used to divide the terms into different communities where each community acts as a concept. In the experiments, we compare the concept extraction results that are obtained by different community detection algorithms to analyze the different semantic graphs. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method. This method can effectively use semantic information, and the results of the concept extraction are better from domain big data in smart cities.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2019.2946181","National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2018YFB0803504,2018YEB1004003); Guangdong Province Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2019B010137004); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871140,61872100,61572153,U1636215); Peng Cheng Laboratory Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:PCL2018KP004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8883289","Knowledge discovery;text analysis;text mining","Semantics;Data mining;Smart cities;Big Data;Clustering algorithms;Frequency-domain analysis;Detection algorithms","Big Data;graph theory;Internet;knowledge engineering;smart cities","semantic information;big data;smart city;automatic concept extraction;process information;knowledge engineering;domain knowledge graphs;Internet knowledge-driven intelligent applications;community detection algorithms;semantic graphs;semantic graph-based concept extraction","","15","","39","IEEE","25 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although the current research in the field of human motion gesture recognition has achieved certain results, the human motion gesture recognition in real life scenes has great effects due to factors such as camera movement, target scale transformation, dynamic background, viewing angle, and illumination. This article first proposes a new method of constructing human motion posture features to describe human behavior. This method is based on deep convolutional neural network features and topic models. Experiments have verified that compared with the traditional feature map extracted from the convolutional neural network fully connected layer, the feature map extracted from the convolutional neural network convolutional layer is not only lower in dimension but also has higher discrimination. Secondly, based on the feature map of the convolutional neural network, the training map downsampling strategy is used to overcome the interference caused by the object's scale change and shape change. Finally, based on the basketball gesture recognition method, the behavior performance of the legs and arms in 9 basketball actions of walking, running, jumping, standing dribbling, walking dribbling, running dribbling, shooting, passing and receiving is analyzed. As well as the corresponding signal waveform characteristics, a two-stage data division method for basketball is proposed.

This article introduces a graph-based feature augmentation approach for enhancing bug triaging systems using machine learning. A new feature augmentation approach that utilizes graph partitioning based on neighborhood overlap is proposed. Neighborhood overlap is a quite effective approach for discovering relationships in social graphs. Terms of bug summaries are represented as nodes in a graph, which is then partitioned into clusters of terms. Terms in strong clusters are augmented to the original feature vectors of bug summaries based on the similarity between the terms in each cluster and a bug summary. We employed other techniques such as term frequency, term correlation, and topic modeling to identify latent terms and augment them to the original feature vectors of bug summaries. Consequently, we utilized frequency, correlation, and neighborhood overlap techniques to create another feature augmentation approach that enriches the feature vectors of bug summaries to use them for bug triaging. The new modified vectors are used to classify bug reports into different priorities. Bug Triage in this context is to correctly recognize the priority of new bugs. Several classification algorithms are tested using the proposed methods. Experimental results on a data set with Eclipse bug reports extracted from the Bugzilla tracking system have shown that our approach outperformed the existing bug triaging systems including modern techniques that utilize deep learning.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2020.3017501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9184143","Bug classification;bug triage;random forest (RAF);software maintenance;software testing","Computer bugs;Semantics;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Information systems;Correlation;Data mining","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;program debugging","automatic bug triage;graph neighborhood relations;graph-based feature augmentation approach;graph partitioning;bug summary;feature vectors;Eclipse bug;bug triaging systems;deep learning","","7","","61","IEEE","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous work mainly considers how to develop ITS frameworks and how to extract useful information from physical sensors. Meanwhile, the relatively rich user-contributed postings which contain valuable information about traffic and road conditions was not leveraged to enhance the effectiveness of ITSs. To address such a research gap, this paper presents a relatively new approach of extracting and analyzing useful driving navigation information from the big data archived on online social media, the so-called social sensors. In particular, we advocate a topic model-based computational method to extract relevant semantics (e.g., traffic conditions, road conditions, drivers' conditions, etc.) from the relatively noisy user-contributed postings on online social media. Then, a classification ensemble method is proposed to automatically identify specific traffic related events, and transmit these useful navigation hints back to an ITS for dissemination to other drivers. Evaluation based on real-world user postings from Twitter and Sina Weibo demonstrates that the proposed social sensor analytics method is effective in identifying main traffic events when compared to other baseline methods. Our work opens the door for the development of the next generation of ITSs which can leverage the big data archived on online social media to enhance the richness and the quality of traffic navigation aids provided by ITSs.","","978-1-5386-2723-5","10.1109/WoWMoM.2017.7974354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7974354","","Social network services;Computational modeling;Data mining;Roads;Vehicles;Navigation;Probabilistic logic","Big Data;data analysis;driver information systems;information retrieval;intelligent transportation systems;sensor fusion;social networking (online)","social sensor based framework;intelligent transportation systems;ITS;drivers navigation information;information extraction;information analysis;Big Data;online social media;Twitter;Sina Weibo;social sensor analytics","","6","","19","IEEE","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we leverage the power of the crowdsourced user reviews to understand why an app requests a permission.

The topic model is further adopted to infer the permission implications of apps from the functionality-relevant user reviews. More than 20,000 apps, 2,653,159 users, and 4,247,769 user reviews are crawled from Google Play as a real-world dataset to evaluate the performance of SmartPI.

Specifically, SSMF factorizes a data matrix into two matrix factors with one factor (i.e., the abundances) constrained to have its columns lying in the unit simplex. SSMF criteria include the well-known Craig's seminal minimum-volume enclosing simplex (MVES), originally proposed for blind hyperspectral unmixing, and the recently introduced maximum-volume inscribed ellipsoid (MVIE). The identifiability analysis of those criteria is essential to understand their fundamental behavior and also to devise effective SSMF algorithms tailored to the specificities of the different application scenarios. Our analysis is motivated by a simple fact taking place in most remotely sensed hyperspectral mixtures: in most pixels, only a subset of the materials is present. This is to say that the abundances exhibit a form of sparsity and thus lie in the boundary of the data simplex. We then derive some elegant sufficient condition, showing that as long as data points are locally well spread, perfect SSMF identifiability of both criteria can be guaranteed.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-7150-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8518462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8518462","Identifiability;blind hyperspectral unmixing;minimum-volume enclosing simplex;maximum-volume inscribed ellipsoid;sparse matrix factorization","Hyperspectral imaging;Ellipsoids;Sparse matrices;Analytical models;Indexes","geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;matrix decomposition;remote sensing;spectral analysis","SSMF identifiability;MVIE;MVES;Craigs seminal minimum-volume enclosing simplex;simplex-structured matrix factorization;linear spectral unmixing;data simplex;remotely sensed hyperspectral mixtures;maximum-volume inscribed ellipsoid;blind hyperspectral unmixing;SSMF criteria;matrix factors;data matrix;archetypal analysis;sparse abundances;identifiability criteria","","3","","18","","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we used Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which is actuated by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). After SVD, we have a compact representation of the documents, which are clustered. In a separate experiment, we did topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). In this initial work, our premise is that comments are of two categories, positive and negative.

The classifiers were then evaluated qualitatively on tweets about the original typhoon (Haiyan in 2013) from which the annotations came from, and on tweets about a typhoon years later (Haima in 2016).

"Predicting the Trends of Stock Price By Social Networks and Fuzzy Deep Support Vector Machine","P.

Due to the high degree of randomness of the stock market, this is a very difficult and challenging task. The general public's overall sentiment for a given company can be regarded as a windball that predicts the future ups and downs of the company's stock price. In recent years, the popularity of social networks has provided a large amount of available social sentiment data. Therefore, mining information from social networking sites and historical stock prices can improve the ability to predict the rise and fall of the stock market. In this paper, we extract hidden topic models and emotional information from the posts of social network. In addition, we developed a new deep fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) to integrate a large amount of emotional and topical information in online posts and tweets to predict the trend of stock prices. Fuzzy theory is very suitable for this research because the text message itself is fuzzy (for example, fast/slow and old/young), and there is a fuzzy boundary between ascending and descending categories. For instance, an increase of 10% or 1% is an increase category, but the degree of attribution is not the same. Compared with the traditional method, the fuzzy deep SVM proposed in this study can more robustly avoid the adverse effects of noise data","","978-1-7281-9048-8","10.1109/SSCI50451.2021.9659980","Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:MOST 110-2221-E-992-066); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9659980","stock price prediction;social network;support vector machine;deep learning;fuzzy set theory","Support vector machines;Training;Fluctuations;Social networking (online);Companies;Market research;Indexes","data mining;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;social networking (online);stock markets;support vector machines;text analysis","social network;fuzzy deep support vector machine;stock price rise;stock market;difficult task;general public;available social sentiment data;social networking sites;historical stock prices;deep fuzzy support vector machine;emotional information;topical information;fuzzy theory;fuzzy deep SVM","","1","","22","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

S. dual degree in Innovation, Leadership, and Engineering Entrepreneurship (ILEE), a second bachelor's degree option for those completing their degree in a traditional engineering discipline. This is unlike many universities where similar degree programs are situated in colleges of business rather than engineering. The first cohort of sixteen students has joined the program in January 2017. In this paper we first report on the stated goals of the new degree, which is meant to combine the technical expertise in the traditional engineering science-focused disciplines with a deeper set of skills in problem-finding, creativity, innovation, leadership, and externalization. The idea is to ensure training in the dual physical and human dimensions and triple aspects of science, design, and leadership that are present in engineering practice. Next we report on the curriculum design as well as the experiential learning pedagogy that is present in most of the courses therein. Core courses include “Design Thinking/Need-Finding”, “Creativity, Innovation, Vision”, “Emotional Intelligence”, “Innovation and Engineering Design”, and “Technology Entrepreneurship”. Further, we provide a characterization of the students in the first cohort of undergraduate students to be accepted into the degree program. Drawing on their application materials, we perform text analytics using techniques such as topic modeling under Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and geometric embedding using the word2vec family of methods, to understand the key motivations for students to pursue this degree. Finally we use these text analytics techniques to make a formal assessment of alignment between the stated goals of the degree program and the key motivations of the students. One particular question is to understand the students' relative level of interest in the three legs of the degree, namely innovation, leadership, and entrepreneurship, so as to predict how level of engagement may vary across courses.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190631","innovation education;leadership education;engineering entrepreneurship education;text analytics","Technological innovation;Entrepreneurship;Creativity;Engineering students","educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;innovation management","innovation;leadership;engineering entrepreneurship;traditional engineering discipline;traditional engineering science;human dimensions;engineering practice;design thinking/need-finding course;innovation and engineering design course;technology entrepreneurship course;creativity innovation vision course;emotional intelligence course;latent Dirichlet allocation;geometric embedding;word2vec method;LDA","","1","","21","","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Web news contains a large amount of social awareness data that represents the public's sense of and response to emerging technologies, and the social awareness data is of great significance for identifying the development trends of emerging technologies. Therefore, this article presented a research framework to identify the development trends of emerging technologies using patent analysis and web news data mining.

Both the approaches have respective merits and demerits. Though lots of algorithms are developed so far, none of them works equally well for all the data sets, specially for very high dimensional data sets. In this work, a new feature evaluation measure based on the concept borrowed from topic modelling in text processing, has been developed. The proposed measure is used as a fitness function of evolutionary computational search techniques for designing filter type feature subset selection approach. Simulation experiments with various benchmark data sets have been done for assessing the efficiency of the proposed approach in comparison to the popular conventional filter type feature selection algorithms mRMR and CFS. It is found that the proposed approach is better in terms of selecting lesser number of features with comparable classification accuracy.

Then realize the feedback of blending user wisdom and machine intelligence. This paper investigates a structured survey of the state of the art in the visualization of traffic data. First, we reviewed five representative traffic data visualization methods including WebVRGIS based traffic analysis and visualization system, TripMiner, IoV distributed architecture, SMASH architecture, and LDA-based topic modelling. Meanwhile, we analyzed the traffic datasets that applied in each method. Then we summarize these methods from seven aspects: scalability, data storage, data update, interactivity, reliability, data anomaly detection, and spatiotemporal visualization. In addition, we make a detailed comparative analysis of the key capabilities of five representative traffic data visualization methods in processing traffic big data. Finally, we conclude that the SMASH architecture performs better in processing high speed and large flow traffic data.

Short texts do not contain sufficient statistical signals to support recent developments in text mining such as topic modeling; iii. Short texts are ambiguous and noisy and are generated in larger volumes which further increase the difficulty in handling them. This paper focuses on two efficient semantic knowledge based techniques for understanding short texts which include i. Harvesting and Analyzing Semantic Knowledge (HASK) technique and ii.

Next, we analyze the hoarding and anti-hoarding patterns of over 42,000 unique Twitter users in the United States from March 1 to April 30, 2020, and dissect the hoarding-related tweets by age, gender, and geographic location. We find the percentage of women in both hoarding and anti-hoarding groups is higher than that of the general Twitter user population. Furthermore, using topic modeling, we investigate the opinions expressed towards the hoarding behavior by categorizing these topics according to demographic and geographic groups. We also calculate the anxiety scores for the hoarding and anti-hoarding related tweets using a lexical approach. By comparing their anxiety scores with the baseline Twitter anxiety score, we reveal further insights. The LIWC anxiety mean for the hoarding-related tweets is significantly higher than the baseline Twitter anxiety mean. Interestingly, beer has the highest calculated anxiety score compared to other hoarded items mentioned in the tweets.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671533","COVID-19;Hoarding Behavior;Social Media;Twitter","COVID-19;Social networking (online);Pandemics;Conferences;Anxiety disorders;Blogs;Sociology","behavioural sciences computing;social networking (online)","hoarding-related tweets;anti-hoarding groups;general Twitter user population;hoarding behavior;baseline Twitter anxiety score;hoarded items;COVID-19 pandemic;unprecedented scale;large-scale social media data;anti-hoarding patterns;Twitter users","","","","27","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The field of nanocarbons has undergone a transformation phase whereby the technology has become matured after many years of basic research, and applied research is currently flourishing. However, the identification of research levels for a comprehensive understanding has only been done in the biomedical field. Here, we develop a novel method that quantitatively captures the macroscopic maturity of nanocarbon research. By statistically extracting nearly 7,000 technical terms based on a topic model, the method calculates continuous scores of technology maturity for each scientific paper. The transition of the scores over the past 50 years for the five countries shows that the research trend has been tending towards applied research with the passage of time. In China especially, research levels go to “applied’ faster than in other countries. In technological fields that require a long period of basic research, this method enables us to capture research maturity in a macroscopic and quantitative manner. Such a comprehensive perspective can provide a view on the commercialization of technologies. Therefore, comparing the index among countries and research institutions may help make investment decisions for technologies that require basic scientific research.","2159-5100","978-1-890843-41-0","10.23919/PICMET53225.2022.9882648","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9882648","","Vocabulary;Biological system modeling;Luminescence;Companies;Market research;Indexes;Commercialization","","","","","","26","","14 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Refactoring research nowadays addresses challenges beyond code transformation to include, but not limited to, scheduling the opportune time to carry refactoring, recommending specific refactoring activities, detecting refactoring opportunities and testing the correctness of applied refactorings. Very few studies focused on the challenges that practitioners face when refactoring software systems and what should be the current refactoring research focus from the developers’ perspective. Without such knowledge, tool builders invest in the wrong direction, and researchers miss many opportunities for improving the practice of refactoring. In this paper, we collected data from the popular online Q&A site, Stack Overflow, and analyzed posts to identify what do developers ask about refactoring. We clustered these questions to find the different refactoring related topics using one of the most popular topic modeling algorithms, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We found that developers are asking about design patterns, design and user interface refactoring, web services, parallel programming, and mobile apps. We also identified what popular refactoring challenges are the most difficult and the current important topics and questions related to refactoring. Moreover, we discovered gaps between existing research on refactoring and the challenges developers face. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first Stack Overflow study to identify the refactoring topics discussed by developers. Our study can help researchers to focus on practical refactoring problems, practitioners know more about current challenges and build better refactoring tools, and educators revise curriculum to target current needs on refactoring.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3140036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9667359","Empirical study;stack overflow;refactoring","Faces;Software systems;Resource management;Parallel programming;Mobile applications;Market research;Information services","","","","","","94","CCBY","31 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many people have turned to online social media platforms to share what they think and how they feel about the sudden impact the pandemic has brought upon us. This project aims to study public attitudes toward COVID-19 on Twitter, a popular social network platform. In particular, it focuses on discovering what issues around COVID-19 people are discussing, why they are interested in such topics, and how their emotions have evolved over time. The study further seeks to reveal potential associations between the breakout and any hidden idea previously unknown to the general public. The dataset was created by collecting approximately 150,000 tweets with keywords or hashtags related to COVID-19 over a course of four weeks with Python and Twitter API. A comprehensive analysis of the tweets was performed using natural language processing methodologies including topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word embedding. The results suggest that many people may be failing to practice appropriate safety measures to stop the spread, despite their high interests in the COVID-19 crisis. In other words, their proactive online actions are not influencing their offline, real-life behaviors.","","978-1-6654-1250-6","10.1109/SIEDS52267.2021.9483708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9483708","natural language processing;COVID-19;social network;text analysis;data mining","COVID-19;Sentiment analysis;Protocols;Social networking (online);Blogs;Mental health;Safety","diseases;natural language processing;social networking (online)","coronavirus disease 2019;social media platforms;study public attitudes;popular social network platform;COVID-19 people;general public;approximately 150 tweets;000 tweets;Twitter API;COVID-19 crisis","","","","11","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides supply and demand, crude oil prices are largely influenced by various factors, such as economic development, financial markets, conflicts, wars, and political events. Most previous research treats crude oil price forecasting as a time series or econometric variable prediction problem. Although recently there have been researches considering the effects of real-time news events, most of these works mainly use raw news headlines or topic models to extract text features without profoundly exploring the event information. In this study, a novel crude oil price forecasting framework, AGESL, is proposed to deal with this problem. In our approach, an open domain event extraction algorithm is utilized to extract underlying related events, and a text sentiment analysis algorithm is used to extract sentiment from massive news. Then a deep neural network integrating the news event features, sentimental features, and historical price features is built to predict future crude oil prices. Empirical experiments are performed on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price data, and the results show that our approach obtains superior performance compared with several benchmark methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9599721","Bayesian inference;crude oil price forecasting;event extraction;natural language processing (NLP);news sentiment","Oils;Forecasting;Feature extraction;Predictive models;Biological system modeling;Time series analysis;Support vector machines","crude oil;data mining;econometrics;economic forecasting;neural nets;pricing;text analysis;time series","event information;crude oil price forecasting framework;open domain event extraction algorithm;underlying related events;text sentiment analysis algorithm;news event features;historical price features;future crude oil prices;West Texas Intermediate crude oil price data;forecasting crude oil price;political events;previous research treats crude oil price forecasting;time series;econometric variable prediction problem;real-time news events;raw news headlines;text features","","","","42","CCBY","2 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prior studies attempted to explore the public awareness and behavioral changes from various research disciplines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature has pointed out that the appropriate use of information sources significantly relates to public attitudes in battling the pandemic. Social media has been the widely used medium to express public interests in current events. Literature shows that social media use during a crisis effectively coordinates relevant information from different sources and promotes situational awareness. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate scalable approaches to promptly gather insights into the public's interests and how governments responded to the interests relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is little empirical research found that tackles these needs. Therefore, we aim to close the research gap by examining the feasible approaches for (1) identifying if public information-seeking has similar patterns as information-sharing on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) comparing the patterns with the government announcements to confirm if the announcements show aligned response to the public information-seeking and sharing during the COVID-19 pandemic. We applied text processing, LDA topic modeling, and Word Mover Distance techniques to realize our aim through a Malaysian case study. Our research work contributes to the application of the LDA-Word2Vec-Word Mover Distance architecture and algorithms that can be used for future investigation and comparison of information seeking and sharing patterns in different research subjects.","","978-1-6654-2168-3","10.1109/I2CT54291.2022.9825122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9825122","Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA);Word2Vec;Word Mover Distance (WMD);COVID-19 pandemic;data mining;text mining;Natural Language Processing (NLP)","COVID-19;Text mining;Pandemics;Social networking (online);Government;Market research;Resource management","natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis","government announcements;public information-seeking;COVID-19 pandemic;Word2Vec-LDA-Word Mover Distance;information sources;social media;public interests","","","","20","IEEE","18 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Semi-supervised learning algorithms, on the contrary, use a small set of labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data to improve predication performance and thus may be a good alternative to supervised learning algorithms for large text datasets. Although many semi-supervised learning algorithms have been proposed in the data science literature, most of these algorithms are not feasible for discrete and unstructured text data.This paper aims to improve classification accuracy of semi-supervised learning algorithms applied to text data. To achieve this goal, a novel design for convolutional neural network is employed in a co-training semi-supervised learning algorithm which adds augmented data as the second input of the convolutional neural network to predict labels of text data. we also propose a novel approach for partitioning the dataset into independent views via topic modeling to train independent classifiers. In so doing, neighbour classifiers are found and confident predictions of unlabeled data are fused into labeled data. The prediction accuracy of the combined algorithm is then compared to the state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. Our findings show that the proposed combined algorithm outperforms the supervised and semi-supervised algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy.

The number of papers and patents is increasing rapidly, and technology commercialization activities in which papers are linked to technology patents are also rapidly developing. Therefore, the necessity of using papers and patents to discover new technological opportunities is emerging. However, despite the semantic similarities between papers and patents, the format and classification systems of documents are very different, so it is difficult to exchange information between documents. This study utilized papers and patent documents to discover new technologies and identify technological opportunities. To overcome the limitations of using paper and patent documents mentioned above, mutual information was utilized by integrating the paper and patent documents and constructing a keyword network using LDA topic modeling and W2Vec methods. In this study, through the results of comparative analysis between papers and patents, first, the research results were uncovered in the white space of technologies that are not linked to patent technologies. Second, a technology potential index is present to evaluate the possibility that the research results can be linked to technology. Third, a technology marketability index that can evaluate the commercialization value of technology is presented. Fourth, through core keyword network analysis, technology trends were identified and technology gaps were discovered, thereby discovering areas in which new technology development is possible. This study contributes to the use of more information by overcoming the limitation of mutual information exchange, even though paper and patent documents contain a lot of technical information. Furthermore, new technologies were discovered, technologies were identified, and technological gaps were uncovered through the results of linking and comparing the paper and patent documents. The technology index, the outcome of this study, enables analyzing the potential and marketability of the technology and evaluating its value. Core keyword network analysis contributed to discovering technical gaps and identifying new technical sectors by utilizing technology connection information through paper and patent documents.
