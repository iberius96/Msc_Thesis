"TLATR: Automatic Topic Labeling Using Automatic (Domain-Specific) Term Recognition","C. -O. Truică; E. -S.

Topic labeling is used to assign meaningful labels for the discovered topics. In this paper, we present a new topic labeling method that uses automatic term recognition to discover and assign relevant labels for each topic, i.e., TLATR (Topic Labeling using Automatic Term Recognition). TLATR uses domain-specific multi-terms that appear in the set of documents belonging to a topic. The multi-term having the highest score as determined by the automatic term recognition algorithm is chosen as the label for that topic. To evaluate TLATR, we use two real, publicly available datasets that contain scientific articles' abstracts. The topic label evaluation is done both automatically and using human annotators. For the automatic evaluation, we use Pointwise Mutual Information, Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information, and document similarity. For human evaluation, we employ the average rating method. Furthermore, we also evaluate the quality of the topic models using the Adjusted Rand Index. To prove that our novel method extracts relevant topic labels, we compare TLATR with two state-of-the-art methods, one supervised and one unsupervised, provided by the NETL Automatic Topic Labelling system. The experimental results show that our method outperforms or provides similar results with both NETL's supervised and unsupervised approaches.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3083000","University Politehnica of Bucharest through the PubArt Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439519","Automatic term recognition;automatic topic labeling evaluation;topic labeling;topic modeling","Labeling;Task analysis;Mutual information;Semantics;Indexes;Computational modeling;Bit error rate","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;text analysis","adjusted Rand index;topic modeling;NETL automatic topic labelling system;topic label evaluation;automatic term recognition algorithm;domain-specific multiterms;topic labeling method;latent topics;probabilistic graphical model;TLATR","","","","63","CCBY","24 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It exploits the contextual embedding of the pre-trained language model to improve the quality of encoding sentences. To generate a topic label with higher Relevance, Coverage, and Discrimination, we propose a novel summarization neural framework. Specifically, it exploits the paired-attention to model the relationship between the candidate sentences first and then decides which sentences should be included in the final summarization topic label. Moreover, we expected that high-quality sentence encoding representation could improve our model's performance.

However, they only react to predefined wordings and do not actually grasp the user's intent. To overcome this limitation, a system must grasp the topics the user is talking about. Therefore, we apply unsupervised multi-topic labeling to spoken utterances. Although topic labeling is a well-studied task on textual documents, its potential for spoken input is almost unexplored. Our approach for topic labeling is tailored to spoken utterances; it copes with short and ungrammatical input. The approach is two-tiered. First, we disambiguate word senses. We utilize Wikipedia as pre-labeled corpus to train a naïve-bayes classifier. Second, we build topic graphs based on DBpedia relations. We use two strategies to determine central terms in the graphs, i.e. the shared topics. One focuses on the dominant senses in the utterance and the other covers as many distinct senses as possible. Our approach creates multiple distinct topics per utterance and ranks results. The evaluation shows that the approach is feasible; the word sense disambiguation achieves a recall of 0.799. Concerning topic labeling, in a user study subjects assessed that in 90.9% of the cases at least one proposed topic label among the first four is a good fit. With regard to precision, the subjects judged that 77.2% of the top ranked labels are a good fit or good but somewhat too broad (Fleiss' kappa k = 0.27).","","978-1-7281-4125-1","10.1109/HCC46620.2019.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8940820","Topic Labeling, Topic Modeling, Unsupervised Machine Learning, Graph Centrality Measures, Word Sense Disambiguation, DBpedia, Wikipedia, Semantic Annotation, Spoken Language Interfaces, Spoken Language Understanding, Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Understanding","Labeling;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet;Adaptation models","Bayes methods;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;text analysis;Web sites","naïve-bayes classifier;Wikipedia;word sense disambiguation;multiple distinct topics;topic graphs;topic labeling;spoken utterances;unsupervised multitopic labeling","","1","","28","","27 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Assigning topic labels to contents, that accurately capture the meaning and contextual information, is a fundamental problem in organizing unstructured data. The usage of manually-assigned tags for this purpose introduces inconsistencies because of different ""surface forms"". On the other hand, existing automated approaches either use hierarchical multi-label classification, or are unsupervised and rely on (undirected) graph measures leveraging taxonomies. While the former requires large training data set to learn the characteristics of each topic class, the latter lacks the flexibility to learn broad range of related topics and are less accurate.We propose a novel framework, ANNOTATE based on a small set of features and directed traversal of taxonomies to learn a broad spectrum of related topics using limited training data. We also show that our approach provides accurate labels for several domains without the need for re-training. For instance, the framework, trained on a small set of BBC news articles, exhibits close matches to user-generated tags for Quora documents. Experimental results, on the same model, for news classification and identifying aspects of Amazon product reviews, based on Amazon Mechanical Turk evaluation show our approach to be significantly better than state-of-the-art.We further present real-life case studies of our proposed framework for automatically tagging Quora posts, and topically segmenting, indexing and linking related YouTube videos (using our publicly available Chrome browser extension).","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622647","","Taxonomy;Labeling;Semantics;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet","Big Data;graph theory;indexing;information retrieval;Internet;online front-ends;pattern classification;social networking (online)","unstructured multimodal data;contextual information;fundamental problem;unstructured data;manually-assigned tags;automated approaches;hierarchical multilabel classification;graph measures;taxonomies;training data set;topic class;accurate labels;user-generated tags;news classification;identifying aspects;indexing;unstructured contents;big data paradigm;surface forms;Amazon Mechanical Turk evaluation;Quora posts;YouTube videos;BBC news articles;topic labels;ANNOTATE","","","","44","","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, a fully connected neural network is applied on the output of the AraBERT model to classify the articles according to their topics.

The experiment aims to find the best word count representation for each topic in order to produce the relevant label name for the topic. Cohen's kappa coefficient is used to measure the reliability of the label based on the agreement of two linguistic experts, while the mean relevance rate is used to measure the average of the relevant value of linguistic experts on a label with particular words representation that has more than 41% of the kappa value. The results of this study indicate the highest kappa value is in the five words representation of each topic with 100% value, while the highest mean relevance rate is in the 5 words and 30 words representation of each topic with 80% value.

Common methods of topic modeling usually produce a collection of unlabeled topics where each topic is depicted by a distribution of words. Associating semantic meaning with these word distributions is not always straightforward. Traditionally, this task is left to human interpretation. Manually labeling the topics is unfortunately not always easy, as topics generated by unsupervised learning methods do not necessarily align well with our prior knowledge in the subject domains. Currently, two approaches to solve this issue exist. The first is a post-processing procedure that assigns each topic with a label from the prior knowledge base that is semantically closest to the word distribution of the topic. The second is a supervised topic modeling approach that restricts the topics to a predefined set whose word distributions are provided beforehand. Neither approach is ideal, as the former may produce labels that do not accurately describe the word distributions, and the latter lacks the ability to detect unknown topics that are crucial to enrich our knowledge base. Our goal in this paper is to introduce a semisupervised Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model, Source-LDA, which incorporates prior knowledge to guide the topic modeling process to improve both the quality of the resulting topics and of the topic labeling. We accomplish this by integrating existing labeled knowledge sources representing known potential topics into a probabilistic topic model. These knowledge sources are translated into a distribution and used to set the hyperparameters of the Dirichlet generated distribution over words. This approach ensures that the topic inference process is consistent with existing knowledge, and simultaneously, allows for discovery of new topics. The results show improved topic generation and increased accuracy in topic labeling when compared to those obtained using various labeling approaches based off LDA.","2375-026X","978-1-5090-6543-1","10.1109/ICDE.2017.99","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7929995","","Mathematical model;Labeling;Sports equipment;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet","inference mechanisms;probability;word processing","probabilistic topic models;prior knowledge sources;semantic meaning;word distributions;supervised topic modeling;semisupervised Latent Dirichlet allocation model;Source-LDA model;labeled knowledge sources;probabilistic topic model;knowledge sources;hyperparameters;Dirichlet generated distribution;topic inference process;topic generation;topic labeling","","27","","42","","18 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most works have been focusing on those widely used languages, such as English and Chinese, with huge dialogue corpora being collected and thoroughly analyzed for training the dialogue generation models. In addition, retaining the human-like diversity and spontaneity of speech in these corpora is challenging for building dialogue systems. In this paper, we propose a method to build a lage Japanese dialogue corpus by using the conversations posted on Twitter and to annotate the dialogue- and utterance-level topic labels and the corresponding probabilistic scores automatically by analyzing the similarity between the word clusters and the dialogue clusters of the corpus in the same semantic space. The advantage of this method is that it does not require the expensive time and effort of human workers for mimicking dialogues and annotating labels, which is specifically useful for those less widely used languages, such as Japanese. We compare four filtering settings with respect to the lower-bound of utterance length for corpus creation and topic annotation and report the effect of the utterance length to the quality of our dialogue corpus, based on a manual evaluation. Based on this corpus, we further propose two topic-based dialogue generation tasks, that is, the next-response-topic prediction task and the next-topic-based response generation task.

With the massive number of repositories available, there is a pressing need for topic-based search. Even though the topic label functionality has been introduced, the majority of GitHub repositories do not have any labels, impeding the utility of search and topic-based analysis. This work targets the automatic repository classification problem as keyword-driven hierarchical classification. Specifically, users only need to provide a label hierarchy with keywords to supply as supervision. This setting is flexible, adaptive to the users' needs, accounts for the different granularity of topic labels and requires minimal human effort. We identify three key challenges of this problem, namely (1) the presence of multi-modal signals; (2) supervision scarcity and bias; (3) supervision format mismatch. In recognition of these challenges, we propose the HiGitClass framework, comprising of three modules: heterogeneous information network embedding; keyword enrichment; topic modeling and pseudo document generation. Experimental results on two GitHub repository collections confirm that HiGitClass is superior to existing weakly-supervised and dataless hierarchical classification methods, especially in its ability to integrate both structured and unstructured data for repository classification.

In topic modeling, each document is represented as a collection of words. Labeling appropriate word distributions to the defined topic is a challenging task. Topic modeling using unsupervised algorithm does not align topics with those as it exists in the real world metaphor. This problem of aligning topic with real world objects can be carried out by two different methods-either to use a supervised learning algorithm that assigns individual topic with a label acquired from existing data or to use a predefined set of topics and to match them with the distribution of words. The above said methods have some drawbacks as the former method may match a label which does not convey a semantic meaning with the word distributions whereas the latter lacks the knowledge required to detect the topic from the closed set of topics. In this paper an algorithm called Concept-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Concept-LDA) is proposed which incorporates reinforcement learning for topic modeling which inturn improves the accuracy of resulting topics and of the topic labeling.

Twitter, for example, provides rich real-time information in keeping with its streaming nature. Making sense of such data without automated support is not feasible due to its vast size and nature. The problem becomes more complex when the data in question have a low variance in terms of topical diversity. Therefore, an automatic method for understanding textual patterns in such topically constrained data needs to be developed. A major challenge to building such a system is in its ability to comprehend the nature of the data with regard to diversity of word structure correlations, vocabulary sparsity, and distinguishing factors in the generated topics. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised approach called metamodel enabled latent Dirichlet allocation to address this challenge. Compared to stateof-the-art approaches, our model incorporates a domain-specific metamodel. The metamodel is defined as a set of topic label vectors derived from long texts to guide the learning process in shorter texts.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2878441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8514104","Social computing;topic coherence;short text mining;metamodel","Twitter;Vocabulary;Data mining;Semantics;Noise measurement;Computational modeling","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);text analysis","topic label vectors;metamodel enabled approach;short text microblogs;social media discussions;knowledge-based applications;recommender systems;real-time information;topical diversity;domain-specific metamodel;coherent topics discovery;textual patterns;word structure correlations;vocabulary sparsity;latent Dirichlet allocation;learning process","","2","","29","OAPA","29 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing work on topic labeling works effectively and performs well on document categorization, but inadequate for granularity of detailed contents. Thus we propose a method for selecting titles for segments in long documents. We analyze the characteristics of high quality titles for article segments, from the aspect of semantic relatedness between the target segment and related articles as well as other segments. Then we revise three features proposed before. We improve the phraseness feature, for giving appropriate scores for long titles. Meanwhile, we combine the features SimPF and Embedding-vector to enhance the efficiency and rationality. We use Wikipedia articles for experimental evaluations, in which a large number of article segments are titled manually, and a great number of articles lack detailed segment titles. We evaluate scoring functions by where hidden original segment titles are ranked, through precision@K. Through rigorous evaluations, we show an optimum combination of the features.","","978-1-5386-7447-5","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2018.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8693246","titling documents, semantic relatedness, keyphrase extraction, document summarization","Internet;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Semantics;Support vector machines;Feature extraction","feature extraction;information retrieval;Internet;natural language processing;text analysis;Web sites","keyphrase features;semantic relatedness;long paragraphs;topic labeling;document categorization;detailed contents;long documents;high quality titles;phraseness feature;long titles;Wikipedia articles;SimPF feature;text browsing;Embedding-vector feature;article segment titles selection;Internet","","","","16","","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The bidirectional RNNs capture context in the past and the following set of words. The past and following contexts are compared to perform topic change detection. In contrast to existing works based on sequence and discriminative models for topic segmentation, our approach does not use a segmented corpus nor (pseudo) topic labels for training. Our model is trained using news articles obtained from the internet.

Most existing fake news detection approaches mainly focus on semantic analysis of news’ contents. However, the detection performance will dramatically decrease when the content of news is short. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection multi-task learning (FDML) model based on the following observations: 1) some certain topics have higher percentages of fake news; and 2) some certain news authors have higher intentions to publish fake news. FDML model investigates the impact of topic labels for the fake news and introduce contextual information of news at the same time to boost the detection performance on the short fake news. Specifically, the FDML model consists of representation learning and multi-task learning parts to train the fake news detection task and the news topic classification task, simultaneously. As far as we know, this is the first fake news detection work that integrates the above two tasks. The experiment results show that the FDML model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world fake news dataset.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2021.3054993","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0202201); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1711261,61976051); Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research(grant numbers:2019B030302002); Basic Research Project of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JCYJ20180306174743727,JCYJ20190806143405318); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9339883","Fake news detection;multi-task learning;topic classification","Task analysis;Social networking (online);Blogs;Linguistics;Feature extraction;Economics;Context modeling","","","","2","","58","IEEE","28 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present an approach which uses topic modeling and anomaly detection to point out the information that may be of particular interest to a domain expert. The strength of our approach is that it shows both domain and common sense knowledge and does not require the model to be re-trained for different experts. The proposed model can suggest decision options based on the analyzed data and user's activity.

The developed techniques have also gained widespread use in various domains with good success, such as automatic speech recognition, information retrieval and text classification, etc. Among them, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are well suited to such tasks, which can capture long-range dependencies among words efficiently, meanwhile alleviating the gradient vanishing or exploding problem during training effectively. Following this line of research, in this paper we explore a novel use of a Siamese LSTM based method to learn more accurate document representation for text categorization. Such a network architecture takes a pair of documents with variable lengths as the input and utilizes pairwise learning to generate distributed representations of documents that can more precisely render the semantic distance between any pair of documents. In doing so, documents associated with the same semantic or topic label could be mapped to similar representations having a relatively higher semantic similarity. Experiments conducted on two benchmark text categorization tasks, viz. IMDB and 20Newsgroups, show that using a three-layer deep neural network based classifier that takes a document representation learned from the Siamese LSTM sub-networks as the input can achieve competitive performance in relation to several state-of-the-art methods.","","978-1-5386-1542-3","10.1109/APSIPA.2017.8282104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8282104","","Semantics;Text categorization;Training;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Task analysis;Logic gates","learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture;pattern classification;speech recognition;text analysis","Siamese LSTM networks;deep learning;artificial intelligence community;automatic speech recognition;information retrieval;text classification;short-term memory networks;long-range dependencies;network architecture;variable lengths;distributed representations;semantic distance;benchmark text categorization tasks;three-layer deep neural network;document representation;semantic similarity","","10","","32","","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a data-driven Riemannian shape theoretic approach for this problem, which analyzes the space of temporal evolution patterns in training image streams, and performs statistics on this shape space to facilitate future image prediction. We consider both discriminative and generative statistical techniques on the shape space, to accommodate cases where the training and test data may or may not have an associated class/topic label, and report improved prediction results on two previously studied image prediction datasets. We also provide complimentary results on predicting images in the past, for time instances before the training data was acquired, and empirically analyze how the prediction accuracy varies over time.","","978-1-5090-6549-3","10.1109/BigMM.2017.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7966711","","Shape;Training;Streaming media;Predictive models;Training data;Data models;Analytical models","image retrieval;statistical analysis","image trail;temporal evolution prediction;data-driven Riemannian shape theoretic approach;temporal evolution patterns;image streams;shape space;discriminative statistical techniques;generative statistical techniques;image prediction datasets;time instances;prediction accuracy","","","","31","","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
