	abstract = {Phishing was a threat in the cyber world a couple of decades ago and still is today. It has grown and evolved over the years as phishers are getting creative in planning and executing the attacks. Thus, there is a need for a review of the past and current phishing approaches. A systematic, comprehensive and easy-to-follow review of these approaches is presented here. The relevant mediums and vectors of these approaches are identified for each approach. The medium is the platform which the approaches reside and the vector is the means of propagation utilised by the phisher to deploy the attack. The paper focuses primarily on the detailed discussion of these approaches. The combination of these approaches that the phishers utilised in conducting their phishing attacks is also discussed. This review will give a better understanding of the characteristics of the existing phishing techniques which then acts as a stepping stone to the development of a holistic anti-phishing system. This review creates awareness of these phishing techniques and encourages the practice of phishing prevention among the readers. Furthermore, this review will gear the research direction through the types of phishing, while also allowing the identification of areas where the anti-phishing effort is lacking. This review will benefit not only the developers of anti-phishing techniques but the policy makers as well.},

	abstract = {Individuals use Twitter for personal communication, whereas businesses, politicians and celebrities use Twitter for branding purposes. Distinguishing Personal from Branding Twitter accounts is important for Twitter analytics. Existing studies of Twitter account classification apply classical supervised learning, which requires intensive manual annotation for training. In this paper, we propose CDS (Collaborative Distant Supervision), a novel learning scheme for Twitter account classification that does not require intensive manual labelling. Twitter accounts are automatically labelled using heuristics for distant supervision learning. To achieve effective learning from heuristic labels, active learning is applied to identify and correct false positive labels, and semi-supervised learning is applied to further use false negatives missed by labelling heuristics for learning. Extensive experiments on Twitter data showed that CDS achieved high classification accuracy.},

@article{JOHN2017385,
	abstract = {Multi-document summarization is the process of extracting salient information from a set of source texts and present that information to the user in a condensed form. In this paper, we propose a multi-document summarization system which generates an extractive generic summary with maximum relevance and minimum redundancy by representing each sentence of the input document as a vector of words in Proper Noun, Noun, Verb and Adjective set. Five features, such as TF_ISF, Aggregate Cross Sentence Similarity, Title Similarity, Proper Noun and Sentence Length associated with the sentences, are extracted, and scores are assigned to sentences based on these features. Weights that can be assigned to different features may vary depending upon the nature of the document, and it is hard to discover the most appropriate weight for each feature, and this makes generation of a good summary a very tough task without human intelligence. Multi-document summarization problem is having large number of decision parameters and number of possible solutions from which most optimal summary is to be generated. Summary generated may not guarantee the essential quality and may be far from the ideal human generated summary. To address this issue, we propose a population-based multicriteria optimization method with multiple objective functions. Three objective functions are selected to determine an optimal summary, with maximum relevance, diversity, and novelty, from a global population of summaries by considering both the statistical and semantic aspects of the documents. Semantic aspects are considered by Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Non Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) techniques. Experiments have been performed on DUC 2002, DUC 2004 and DUC 2006 datasets using ROUGE tool kit. Experimental results show that our system outperforms the state of the art works in terms of Recall and Precision.},

	abstract = {The huge amount of research papers on the web makes finding a relevant manuscript a difficult task. In recent years many models were introduced to support researchers by providing personalized citation recommendations. Moreover, deep learning methods have been employed in this domain to improve the quality of the final recommendations. However, a thorough study that classifies citation recommendation models and examines their (a) strengths and weaknesses, (b) evaluation metrics used, (c) popular datasets, and challenges faced is missing. Therefore, with this survey, we present a new classification approach for deep learning models that provide citation recommendation. Our approach uses the following six criteria: data factors, data representation methods, methodologies, types of recommendations used, problems addressed, and personalization. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis of those models that use the same set of evaluation metrics and datasets. Moreover, we examine hot upcoming issues and solutions in light of explored literature. Also, the survey discusses and analyzes the evaluation metrics and datasets adopted by the explored models. Finally, we conclude our survey with trends and future directions to further assist research on that domain.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems use algorithms to provide users with product or service recommendations. Recently, these systems have been using machine learning algorithms from the field of artificial intelligence. However, choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm for a recommender system is difficult because of the number of algorithms described in the literature. Researchers and practitioners developing recommender systems are left with little information about the current approaches in algorithm usage. Moreover, the development of recommender systems using machine learning algorithms often faces problems and raises questions that must be resolved. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature that analyzes the use of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems and identifies new research opportunities. The goals of this study are to (i) identify trends in the use or research of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems; (ii) identify open questions in the use or research of machine learning algorithms; and (iii) assist new researchers to position new research activity in this domain appropriately. The results of this study identify existing classes of recommender systems, characterize adopted machine learning approaches, discuss the use of big data technologies, identify types of machine learning algorithms and their application domains, and analyzes both main and alternative performance metrics.},

@article{KWON2017386,
	abstract = {With an increasing attempt of finding latent semantics in a video dataset, trajectories have become key components since they intrinsically include concise characteristics of object movements. An approach to analyze a trajectory dataset has concentrated on semantic region retrieval, which extracts some regions in which have their own patterns of object movements. Semantic region retrieval has become an important topic since the semantic regions are useful for various applications, such as activity analysis. The previous literatures, however, have just revealed semantically relevant points, rather than actual regions, and have less consideration of temporal dependency of observations in a trajectory. In this paper, we propose a novel model for trajectory analysis and semantic region retrieval. We first extend the meaning of semantic regions that can cover actual regions. We build a model for the extended semantic regions based on a hierarchically linked infinite hidden Markov model, which can capture the temporal dependency between adjacent observations, and retrieve the semantic regions from a trajectory dataset. In addition, we propose a sticky extension to diminish redundant semantic regions that occur in a non-sticky model. The experimental results demonstrate that our models well extract semantic regions from a real trajectory dataset.},

@article{KARDAS2017343,
	abstract = {This paper introduces a Surveillance Video Analysis System, called SVAS, for surveillance domain, in which the semantic rules and the definition of event models can be learned or defined by the user for automatic detection and inference of complex video events. In the scope of SVAS, an event model method named Interval-Based Spatio-Temporal Model (IBSTM) is proposed. SVAS can learn action models and event models without any predefined threshold values and generates understandable and manageable IBSTM event models. Hybrid machine learning methods are proposed and used. A set of feature models named Threshold Model, which reflects the spatio-temporal motion analysis of an event, is kept as the first model. As the second model, Bag of Actions (BoA) model is used in order to reduce the search space in the detection phase. Markov Logic Network (MLN) model, which provides understandable and manageable logic predicates for users, is kept as the third model. SVAS has high performance event detection capability due to its interval-based hierarchical manner. It determines related candidate intervals for each main model of IBSTM and uses the related main model when needed rather than using all models as a whole. The main contribution of this study is to fill the semantic gap between humans and video computer systems such that, on the one hand it decreases human intervention through its learning capabilities, but on the other hand it also enables human intervention when necessary through its manageable event model method. The study achieves all of them in the most efficient way through its machine learning methods. The proposed system is applied to different event datasets from CAVIAR, BEHAVE and our synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that our approach improves the event recognition performance and precision as compared to the current state-of-the-art approaches.},

@article{ULIAN2021115341,
	abstract = {News recommendations distinguishes from general content recommendations as it takes in consideration news freshness, sparsity, monotony and time. Recent works approach these features using hybrid Collaborative-Content-based Filtering methods, adapting clustering techniques to handle sparsity and monotony without considering the effects that different clustering methods may have over recommendation results. Such studies often evaluate the results of varying different parameters individually, ignoring possible interaction effects between them. They also base their results on metrics such as accuracy and recall that are sensitive to bias. To investigate the importance of clustering method selection to News Recommender System results we evaluated the effects of different traditional techniques in recommending news articles. We implemented an algorithm that used a hybrid Collaborative-Content-based Filtering method to incorporate user behavior, user interest, article popularity and time effect. The system uses an article selection method that built the recommendation set based on content features. With this algorithm, we examined the existence of interaction effects between the input parameters. We used a Gaussian regression process to explore the response surface while sequentially optimizing parameters. To avoid being misled by underlying biases we used Informedness, an accuracy metric that captures both positive and negative information from prediction results. Our results demonstrated that different clustering methods had a significant influence on the recommendation results. It was also found that a traditional hierarchical method outperformed optimization methods with important performance improvement. In addition, we demonstrated that parameters may interact with each other and that analyzing them separately may mislead interpretation.},

	abstract = {In order to make computers understand human languages and to reason, human knowledge needs to be represented and stored in a form that can be processed by computers. Knowledge graphs have been developed for use as a form of the knowledge base for words and general relationships among words. However, they have two limitations. One is that the knowledge graph is limited in size and scope for most of the human languages. Another is that they are not able to deal with neologisms that form a part of the human common sense. Addressing these problems, we have developed and validated PolarisX which can automatically expand a knowledge graph, by crawling and analyzing the news sites and social media in real-time. We utilize and fine-tune the pre-trained multilingual BERT model for the construction of knowledge graphs without language dependencies. We extract new relationships using the BERT-based relation extraction model and integrate them into the knowledge graph. We verify the novelty and accuracy of PolarisX. It deals with neologisms and does not have language dependencies.},

We evaluated the performance of this model, in which model capacity is controlled by integrating over all model parameters, and investigated whether it can be made to work more efficiently by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for both recommendation and rating aggregation.

	abstract = {Predicting hospital readmission with effective machine learning techniques has attracted a great attention in recent years. The fundamental challenge of this task stems from characteristics of the data extracted from electronic health records (EHR), which are imbalanced class distributions. This challenge further leads to the failure of most existing models that only provide a partial understanding for the learning problem and result in a biased and inaccurate prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a new graph-based class-imbalance learning method by fully making use of the data from different classes. First, we conduct graph construction for learning the pattern discrimination from between-class and within-class data samples. Then we design an optimization framework to incorporate the constructed graphs to obtain a class-imbalance aware graph embedding and further alleviate performance degeneration. Finally, we design a neural network model as the classifier to conduct imbalanced classification, i.e., hospital readmission prediction. Comprehensive experiments on six real-world readmission datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in readmission prediction task.},

	abstract = {Retrieving information from an online search engine is the first and most important step in many data mining tasks, such as fake news detection. Most of the search engines currently available on the web, including all social media platforms, are black-boxes (i.e., opaque) supporting short keyword queries. In these settings, it is challenging to retrieve all posts and comments discussing a particular news item automatically and on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a method for generating short keyword queries given a prototype document. The proposed iterative query selection (IQS) algorithm interacts with the opaque search engine to iteratively improve the query, by maximizing the number of relevant results retrieved. Our evaluation of IQS was performed on the Twitter TREC Microblog 2012 and TREC-COVID 2019 datasets and demonstrated the algorithm's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art. In addition, we implemented IQS algorithm to automatically collect a large-scale dataset for fake news detection task of about 70K true and fake news items. The dataset, which we have made publicly available to the research community, includes over 22M accounts and 61M tweets. We demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset for fake news detection task achieving state-of-the-art performance.},

In this paper, we present a deep learning neural network framework that utilizes reviews in addition to content-based features to generate model based predictions for the business-user combinations. We show that a set of content and collaborative features allows for the development of a neural network model with the goal of minimizing logloss and rating misclassification error using stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm.

	abstract = {This work explores the integrated power of swarm intelligence and advances in data mining techniques to solve the information retrieval (IR) problem of rapidly growing digital content on the World Wide Web. We propose a swarm optimized cluster based framework with frequent pattern mining techniques to retrieve user-specific knowledge from extensive document collections. In the pre-processing phase, we split the task into two sub-tasks. The first is to decompose the document collection into groups using a bio-inspired K-Flock clustering algorithm, while the second extracts frequent patterns from each cluster using a memory-efficient Recursive Elimination (RElim) algorithm. In the next phase, we implement a cosine similarity based probabilistic model to retrieve query-specific documents from clusters based on the matching scores between the closed frequent patterns of queries and clusters. The performance of a system is evaluated by conducting several experiments which are carried out on five well-known, diverse and variable size datasets viz- TREC 2014-15 CDS (Clinical Decision Support) datasets containing 733,138 records, OHSUMED dataset with 348,566 records from Medline database, NPL dataset with 11,429 records, LISA document collection of 6004 records, CACM (Collection of ACM) dataset of 3204 records. The results show that the proposed IR framework significantly outperforms the traditional sequential IR approach and other state-of-the-art IR approaches, both in terms of the quality of the returned documents and the time of execution.},

	abstract = {In various recommender systems, ratings and reviews are the main information to show user preferences. However, recommendation models that only use ratings, such as collaborative filtering, are vulnerable to data sparsity. And models only using review information will also suffer from the sparsity of reviews. On one hand, most ratings and reviews are interrelated and complementary, reviews may explain why a user gives a high or low rating to an item. On the other hand, ratings and reviews are numerical and textual information, respectively, and they reflect the preference of the user from a coarse-grained level and a fine-grained level A user may comment positively about some aspects of an item, even he gives a very low score to this item. There are specific information among each of them because of their heterogeneity. Therefore, it is possible to learn more accurate representation of users and items by effectively integrating ratings and text reviews from different views, that is, shared-view and specific-view. In this paper, we propose a Shared-view and Specific-view Information extraction model for Recommendation (SSIR), which integrates the information from reviews and interaction matrix to predict ratings Our model has two key components, including shared-view information extraction and specific-view exploitation. From the perspective of shared-view, SSIR jointly minimizes the loss of confusion adversarial and rating prediction loss to extract the shared information from reviews and user--item interaction matrix. For the specific-view part, SSIR applies orthogonal constraints on shared-view and specific-view modules to extract the discriminative features from reviews and interaction data. We fuse the features extracted from these two views to predict the final ratings. In addition, we use auxiliary reviews to deal with the sparsity problem of reviews. Experimental results on eight datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of our method, which could adapt to the recommendation scenarios with fewer reviews and ratings.},

	abstract = {Subway passenger flow prediction is of great significance in transportation planning and operation. Special events, as for vocal concerts and sports games, lead large-scaled passenger flow with few periodic trends. Therefore, predicting subway outbound flow during events is a challenging task. In recent years, social media has been used for socio-economic forecasting. Correlation analysis shows that the trend of social media volume can be used for passenger flow prediction under events occurrences. In this paper, besides traditional smart card data, we incorporate social media data into passenger flow prediction. The multivariate disturbance-based hybrid deep neural network (MDB-HDNN), which models the disturbances of the inbound flow from the nearby stations and the social media post trends, is proposed for subway passenger flow prediction during events. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the MDB-HDNN performs well under various settings and has better robustness. Our findings and results can provide decision support for schedule formulation and passenger flow guidance.},

	abstract = {With the development of machine learning technologies, predicting stock movements by analyzing news articles has been studied actively. Most of the existing studies utilize only the datasets of target companies, and some studies use datasets of the relevant companies in the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sectors. However, we show that GICS has a limitation in finding relevance regarding stock prediction because heterogeneity exists in the GICS sectors. To solve this limitation, we suggest a methodology that reflects heterogeneity and searches for homogeneous groups of companies which have high relevance. Stock price movements are predicted using the K-means clustering and multiple kernel learning technique which integrates information from the target company and its homogeneous cluster. We experiment using three-year data from the Republic of Korea and compare the results of the proposed method with those of existing methods. The results show that the proposed method shows higher predictability than existing methods in the majority of cases. The results also imply that the necessity of cluster analysis depends on the heterogeneity in the sector, and it is essential to perform cluster analysis with a larger number of clusters as the heterogeneity increases.},

The research so far has focused only on forensic scenarios by performing post-analysis using all the available text evidence. This paper introduces the task of Early Author Profiling (EAP) in Twitter. The goal is to effectively recognize profiles using as few tweets as possible from the user history. The task is highly relevant to support social media analysis and different problems related to security and marketing, where prevention and anticipation is crucial. This work proposes a novel strategy that combines a state of the art representation for early text classification and specialized word-vectors for author profiling tasks. In this strategy we build prototypical features called Profile based Meta-Words, which allow us to model AP information at different levels of granularity. Our evaluation shows that the proposed methodology is well suited for profiling little text evidence (e.g., a handful of tweets) in early stages, but as more tweets become available other granularities better encode larger amounts of text in late stages. We evaluated the proposed ideas on gender and language variety identification for English and Spanish, and showed that the proposal outperforms state of the art methodologies.},

It helps in analyzing users' opinions about different entities or events, which can then be utilized by analysts for various purposes. Particularly, feature-based sentiment analysis is one of the challenging research areas that analyzes users' opinions on various features of a product or service. Of the three formats for the product reviews, our focus in this paper is limited to analyzing the pros/cons type. Due to the nature of pros/cons reviews, they are mostly concise and follow a different structure from other review types. Therefore, specialized techniques are needed to analyze these reviews and extract the customers' discussed product features along with their personal attitudes. In this paper, we propose the Pros/Cons Sentiment Analyzer (PCSA) framework that exploits dependency relations in extracting sentiment knowledge from pros/cons reviews. We also utilize two different lexicons to ascertain the polarity strength of the extracted features based on the customers' opinions. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of PCSA in its different phases.},

	abstract = {Insurance fraud is ranked second in the list of expensive crimes in the United States, with healthcare fraud being the second highest amongst all insurance fraud. Contrary to the popular belief, insurance fraud is not a victimless crime. The cost of crime is passed onto law-abiding citizens in the form of increased premiums or serious harm or danger to beneficiaries. To combat this kind of societal threat, there is an intense need for healthcare fraud detection systems to evolve. Some common roadblocks in implementing digital advancements (as seen in other domains) to healthcare are the complexity, heterogeneity of the data systems, and varied health program models across the United States. In other words, data are not stored in a centralized manner due to the sensitive domain nature, thus making it difficult to implement a robust real-world fraud-detection system. At the same time, in addition to the complexity of the varied systems involved, there is also the need to meet certain standards before a fraud actor can be prosecuted in a litigation setting. Thus, there is a human aspect to the fraud detection process flow in the real-world. In this article, a novel framework was outlined that converts diverse prescription claims (both fee-for-service and managed care) into a set of input variables/features suitable for implementation of an advanced statistical modeling fraud framework. This article thus aims to contribute to the existing literature by describing a process to transform prescription claims data to secondary features specific to provider fraud detection. The core idea was to focus on three main aspects of fraud (business heuristics on claims, provider-to-prescriber relations, and provider's client populations) to design the input features. A systematic method was proposed to extract features that have the potential to detect billing or behavioral outliers among pharmacy providers using information extracted from a secondary database (outpatient prescriptions). The application of a commonly used dimensionality reduction method, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), was evaluated. PCA evaluates and reduces the extensive feature subspace to only those that captures the most variance in the data. To evaluate the features extracted from this framework, the application of the engineered features and the principal components to out-of-the-box logistic regression and Random Forest algorithms were considered to identify potential fraud. The engineered features when tested in different experimental settings with a logistic regression model had the highest area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.76 and a weighted F score of 0.85 while a random forest model had the highest area under curve of 0.74 and a weighted F score of 0.88.},

	abstract = {Natural Language Understanding has seen an increasing number of publications in the last few years, especially after robust word embeddings models became prominent, when they proved themselves able to capture and represent semantic relationships from massive amounts of data. Nevertheless, traditional models often fall short in intrinsic issues of linguistics, such as polysemy and homonymy. Any expert system that makes use of natural language in its core, can be affected by a weak semantic representation of text, resulting in inaccurate outcomes based on poor decisions. To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel approach called Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA), that disambiguates and annotates each word by its specific sense, considering the semantic effects of its context. Our approach brings three main contributions to the semantic representation scenario: (i) an unsupervised technique that disambiguates and annotates words by their senses, (ii) a multi-sense embeddings model that can be extended to any traditional word embeddings algorithm, and (iii) a recurrent methodology that allows our models to be re-used and their representations refined. We test our approach on six different benchmarks for the word similarity task, showing that our approach can produce state-of-the-art results and outperforms several more complex state-of-the-art systems.},

Since 2013, Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) has hosted a worldwide community-acknowledged competition that allows for comparisons of recent innovations. The sentiment analysis tasks focus on assessing sentiment in Twitter posts authored by various publishers and addressing multiple subjects. Our study aimed to compare selected popular and recent natural language processing methods using a new data set of Twitter posts sent to a single Twitter account. For improved comparability of our experiments with SemEval, we adopted their metrics and also deployed our models on data published for SemEval-2017. In addition, we investigated if an unsupervised ML technique applied for the detection of topics in tweets can be leveraged to improve the predictive performance of a selected transformer model. We also demonstrated how a recent explainable artificial intelligence technique can be used in Twitter sentiment analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the models' predictions. Our results show that the most recent DL language modeling approach provides the highest quality; however, this quality comes at reduced model transparency.},

	abstract = {As a variant problem of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) aims to identify the aspect categories discussed in sentences and predict their sentiment polarities. However, most aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) research focuses on predicting the sentiment polarities of given aspect categories or aspect terms explicitly discussed in sentences. In contrast, aspect categories are often discussed implicitly. Additionally, most of the research does not consider the relations between contextual words and aspect categories. This paper proposes a novel Semantic Relatedness-enhanced Graph Network (SRGN) model which integrates the semantic relatedness information through an Edge-gated Graph Convolutional Network (EGCN). We introduce an ontology-based approach and a distributional approach to calculate the semantic relatedness values between contextual words and aspect categories. EGCN with the capability to aggregate multi-channel edge features, is then applied to model the semantic relatedness values in a graphical structure. We also employ an aspect--context attention module to generate aspect-specific representations. The proposed SRGN is evaluated on five datasets constructed based on SemEval 2015, SemEval 2016 and MAMC-ACSA datasets. Experimental results indicate that our proposed model outperforms the baseline models in both accuracy and F1 score.},

Our findings reveal that GameDKT approach could successfully predict the performance of players in the coming game task using the cross-validated CNN model with accuracy and AUC of roughly 85% and 0.913, respectively, thus outperforming the MLP baseline model by up to 14%.

We show the approximate detailed balance property of subgradient HMC which reveals a natural and validated generalization of the ordinary HMC. Furthermore, we investigate the variants that use stochastic subsampling and thermostats for better scalability and mixing. Using stochastic subgradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we efficiently solve the posterior inference task of various Bayesian max-margin models and extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

	abstract = {We present methods of extractive query-oriented single-document summarization using a deep auto-encoder (AE) to compute a feature space from the term-frequency (tf) input. Our experiments explore both local and global vocabularies. We investigate the effect of adding small random noise to local tf as the input representation of AE, and propose an ensemble of such noisy AEs which we call the Ensemble Noisy Auto-Encoder (ENAE). ENAE is a stochastic version of an AE that adds noise to the input text and selects the top sentences from an ensemble of noisy runs. In each individual experiment of the ensemble, a different randomly generated noise is added to the input representation. This architecture changes the application of the AE from a deterministic feed-forward network to a stochastic runtime model. Experiments show that the AE using local vocabularies clearly provide a more discriminative feature space and improves the recall on average 11.2%. The ENAE can make further improvements, particularly in selecting informative sentences. To cover a wide range of topics and structures, we perform experiments on two different publicly available email corpora that are specifically designed for text summarization. We used ROUGE as a fully automatic metric in text summarization and we presented the average ROUGE-2 recall for all experiments.},

	abstract = {Twitter has become a major tool for spreading news, for dissemination of positions and ideas, and for the commenting and analysis of current world events. However, with more than 500 million tweets flowing per day, it is necessary to find efficient ways of collecting, storing, managing, mining and visualizing all this information. This is especially relevant if one considers that Twitter has no ways of indexing tweet contents, and that the only available categorization ``mechanism'' is the #hashtag, which is totally dependent of a user's will to use it. This paper presents an intelligent platform and framework, named MISNIS - Intelligent Mining of Public Social Networks' Influence in Society - that facilitates these issues and allows a non-technical user to easily mine a given topic from a very large tweet's corpus and obtain relevant contents and indicators such as user influence or sentiment analysis. When compared to other existent similar platforms, MISNIS is an expert system that includes specifically developed intelligent techniques that: (1) Circumvent the Twitter API restrictions that limit access to 1% of all flowing tweets. The platform has been able to collect more than 80% of all flowing portuguese language tweets in Portugal when online; (2) Intelligently retrieve most tweets related to a given topic even when the tweets do not contain the topic #hashtag or user indicated keywords. A 40% increase in the number of retrieved relevant tweets has been reported in real world case studies. The platform is currently focused on Portuguese language tweets posted in Portugal. However, most developed technologies are language independent (e.g. intelligent retrieval, sentiment analysis, etc.), and technically MISNIS can be easily expanded to cover other languages and locations.},

	abstract = {Project-based learning is based on the idea of iteratively learning for future projects from the successes and failures of past projects. This paper proposes a semi-automated implementation approach for double-loop learning in project environments. A combined application of two complementary methods is suggested for this purpose: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Analytic Network Process (ANP). By this means, the approach addresses two problems of the project management practice. First, the information overload in project environments, whereby the LSA is used for the semi-automated extraction of lessons learned from large collections of textual project documentation. Second, the lack of procedures and methods for the practical implementation of available project knowledge, whereby the ANP is used for the systematic modeling of extracted lessons learned and their integration into the evaluation of project concepts and current project management routines. Thus, the proposed implementation approach improves the ability of project-based organizations to consequently learn from past failures or successes. From a practical perspective, evident shortcomings of existing computerized double-loop learning approaches are addressed. The proposed approach contributes to the project management practice not only by demonstrating a solution for the exploration of representative and potentially new lessons from multiple combined experience reports, but also by presenting a solution for the systematic assessment of such project-governing variables and their mutual relationships as part of the decision-making in new projects. From a theoretical perspective, specific research avenues for further development of the double-loop learning concept by means of expert and intelligent systems are provided.},

Not only do shared posts give important information about what is happening (from the users' perspective), but also the metadata linked to these posts offer relevant data, such as the GPS-location in Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs). In this paper we introduce a global analysis of the geo-tagged posts in social media which supports (i) the detection of unexpected behavior in the city and (ii) the analysis of the posts to infer what is happening. The former is obtained by applying density-based clustering techniques, whereas the latter is consequence of applying content aggregation techniques. We have applied our methodology to a dataset obtained from Instagram activity in New York City for seven months obtaining promising results. The developed algorithms require very low resources, being able to analyze millions of data-points in commodity hardware in less than one hour without applying complex parallelization techniques. Furthermore, the solution can be easily adapted to other geo-tagged data sources without extra effort.},

	abstract = {In 2019 there was an outbreak of coronavirus pandemic also known as COVID-19. Many scientists believe that the pandemic originated from Wuhan, China, before spreading to other parts of the globe. To reduce the spread of the disease, decision makers encouraged measures such as hand washing, face masking, and social distancing. In early 2021, some countries including the United States began administering COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccination brought a relief to the public; it also generated a lot of debates from anti-vaccine and pro-vaccine groups. The controversy and debate surrounding COVID-19 vaccine influenced the decision of several people in either to accept or reject vaccination. Because of data limitations, social media data, collected through live streaming public tweets using an Application Programming Interface (API) search, is considered a viable and reliable resource to study the opinion of the public on Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy. Thus, this study examines 3 sentiment computation methods (Azure Machine Learning, VADER, and TextBlob) to analyze COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Five learning algorithms (Random Forest, Logistics Regression, Decision Tree, LinearSVC, and Na{\"\i}ve Bayes) with different combination of three vectorization methods (Doc2Vec, CountVectorizer, and TF-IDF) were deployed. Vocabulary normalization was threefold; potter stemming, lemmatization, and potter stemming with lemmatization. For each vocabulary normalization strategy, we designed, developed, and evaluated 42 models. The study shows that Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy slowly decreases over time; suggesting that the public gradually feels warm and optimistic about COVID-19 vaccination. Moreover, combining potter stemming and lemmatization increased model performances. Finally, the result of our experiment shows that TextBlob + TF-IDF + LinearSVC has the best performance in classifying public sentiment into positive, neutral, or negative with an accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of 0.96752, 0.96921, 0.92807 and 0.94702 respectively. It means that the best performance was achieved when using TextBlob sentiment score, with TF-IDF vectorization and LinearSVC classification model. We also found out that combining two vectorizations (CountVectorizer and TF-IDF) decreases model accuracy.},

Despite the research efforts aiming at providing efficient solutions for the anonymization of huge databases (including networked data), in online social networks the most powerful privacy protection ``weapons'' are the users themselves. However, most users are not aware of the risks derived by the indiscriminate disclosure of their personal data. Moreover, even when social networking platforms allow their participants to control the privacy level of every published item, adopting a correct privacy policy is often an annoying and frustrating task and many users prefer to adopt simple but extreme strategies such as ``visible-to-all'' (exposing themselves to the highest risk), or ``hidden-to-all'' (wasting the positive social and economic potential of social networking websites). In this paper we propose a theoretical framework to i) measure the privacy risk of the users and alert them whenever their privacy is compromised and ii) help the users customize semi-automatically their privacy settings by limiting the number of manual operations. By investigating the relationship between the privacy measure and privacy preferences of real Facebook users, we show the effectiveness of our framework.},

	abstract = {Currently, modeling and analyzing timed compatibility of Petri net based mediation-aided Web service composition by model checking are attracting increasing attention in the expert and intelligent systems community. However, existing methods cannot handle mediation-aided Web service composition involving complex mediation transitions, suffer from low efficiency owing to the larger size of time automata (TA) models, or are unable to automatically check temporal constraints whose activities do not include exchanged messages by observing TA. In this paper, we present a novel three-stage approach for analyzing timed compatibility of mediation-aided Web service composition via model checking. First, stage 1 treats each service in Petri net based mediation-aided Web service composition as a fragment. Second, stage 2 transforms fragments into a time automata net (TAN) based on structure transformation and interactive message transformation. Finally, stage 3 checks all types of temporal constraints. The main impact of our approach on expert and intelligent systems involves the following aspects: 1) mediation-aided service composition with complex mediation transitions can be dealt with; 2) compact TAN can be constructed for fragments in which the number of states and arcs is dramatically decreased and the verification time is extremely reduced compared with existing methods; and 3) temporal constraints whose activities have or do not have exchanged messages can be located in TAN. The main significance of our approach in the field of expert and intelligent systems is that it can greatly reduce the risk of making business decisions and the cost of handling temporal violations, and improves the innovation capability of enterprises.},

	abstract = {After digitally designing components of vehicles, a design team creates a virtual manufacturing environment that resembles actual manufacturing facilities. During this digital pre-assembly process, a review team examines each component, and records its problems and requirements in part verification reports. Once these reports are delivered to specific design team responsible for each part, the design team can make appropriate adjustments to their designs. This digital pre-assembly process can evaluate and prevent flaws in design prior to actual manufacturing, improving production quality and reducing manufacturing cost. As these reports are written in free text form, they, however, are not fully utilized for understanding problems arising from the design process. This paper proposes a method of applying text mining techniques on verification reports to extract insights for quality improvement. In this paper, following three text mining approaches are proposed: (1) Extracting n-grams for text preprocessing and constructing domain ontology; (2) Extracting meaningful insights from text preprocessing; (3) Creating intuitive visual tools to understand the extracted insights. The proposed method is applied on approximately 140,000 reports, and is validated through the quality of the answers obtained for the questions posed by the domain experts. The proposed method successfully extracts useful information from the text database, and provides intuitive graphical interface, thereby satisfying the need of the domain experts. This paper proposes a systematic framework of transforming huge amount of raw text data into intuitive visualization. Through this framework, meaningful knowledge can be extracted, analyzed and shared to improve the quality of the products. Main contribution of our paper is that it proposes a framework for knowledge extraction from pre-assembly process. Not only does it systematically arrange the data, but it also combines various data sources and creates a knowledge system to improve efficiency of the design process.},

	abstract = {The cold-start problem is one of the critical challenges in personalized recommender systems. A lot of existing work has been studied to exploit a user-item rating matrix as well as additional information for users/items, e.g., user profiles, item contents, and social relationships among users. However, because existing work is primarily biased to the auxiliary information for users/items, it is difficult to identify various and reliable item neighbors that are relevant to cold-start items. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a new crowd-enabled framework, called CrowdStart, which is an integrated human-machine approach for new item recommendation. The main contributions of the CrowdStart framework are two-fold: (1) To find various and reliable item neighbors for new items, we design two-step crowdsourcing tasks that harness not only machine-only algorithms but also the knowledge of crowd workers (including a few experts and a large number of non-expert workers in a crowdsourcing platform). (2) We develop a novel hybrid model to exploit the user-item rating matrix, the content information about items, and the crowd-based item neighbors from human knowledge into new item recommendation. To evaluate the effectiveness of the CrowdStart framework, we conduct extensive experiments including both a user study and simulation tests. Through the empirical study, we found that the CrowdStart framework provides relevant, diverse, reliable, and explainable crowd-based neighbors for new items and the crowd-based neighbors are meaningful for improving the accuracy of new item recommendation.

	abstract = {Traditional summarization methods only use the internal information of a Web document while ignoring its social information such as tweets from Twitter, which can provide a perspective viewpoint for readers towards an event. This paper proposes a framework named SoRTESum to take the advantages of social information such as document content reflection to extract summary sentences and social messages. In order to do that, the summarization was formulated in two steps: scoring and ranking. In the scoring step, the score of a sentence or social message is computed by using intra-relation and inter-relation which integrate the support of local and social information in a mutual reinforcement form. To calculate these relations, 16 features are proposed. After scoring, the summarization is generated by selecting top m ranked sentences and social messages. SoRTESum was extensively evaluated on two datasets. Promising results show that: (i) SoRTESum obtains significant improvements of ROUGE-scores over state-of-the-art baselines and competitive results with the learning to rank approach trained by RankBoost and (ii) combining intra-relation and inter-relation benefits single-document summarization.},

	abstract = {With the increasing popularity of large scale Knowledge Graph (KG)s, many applications such as semantic analysis, search and question answering need to link entity mentions in texts to entities in KGs. Because of the polysemy problem in natural language, entity disambiguation is thus a key problem in current research. Existing disambiguation methods have considered entity prominence, context similarity and entity-entity relatedness to discriminate ambiguous entities, which are mainly working on document or paragraph level texts containing rich contextual information, and based on lexical matching for computing context similarity. When meeting short texts containing limited contextual information, such as web queries, questions and tweets, those conventional disambiguation methods are not good at handling single entity mention and measuring context similarity. In order to enhance the performance of disambiguation methods based on context similarity with such short texts, we propose SCSNED method for disambiguation based on semantic similarity between contextual words and informative words of entities in KGs. Specially, we exploit the effectiveness of both knowledge-based and corpus-based semantic similarity methods for entity disambiguation with SCSNED. Moreover, we propose a Category2Vec embedding model based on joint learning of word and category embedding, in order to compute word-category similarity for entity disambiguation. We show the effectiveness of these proposed methods with illustrative examples, and evaluate their effectiveness in a comparative experiment for entity disambiguation in real world web queries, questions and tweets. The experimental results have identified the effectiveness of different semantic similarity methods, and demonstrated the improvement of semantic similarity methods in SCSNED and Category2Vec over the conventional context similarity baseline. We further compare the proposed approaches with the state of the art entity disambiguation systems and show the performances of the proposed approaches are among the best performing systems. In addition, one important feature of the proposed approaches using semantic similarity, is the potential application on any existing KGs since they mainly use common features of entity descriptions and categories. Another contribution of the paper is an updated survey on background of entity disambiguation in KGs and semantic similarity methods.},

Recent solutions focus on exploring the correlation between sentiment and textual reviews in the review-based recommendation. However, these studies usually pay less attention to the differences of different users in sentimental expression styles or language usage habits when a user writes reviews. In this work, we argue that the individual reviewing behavior is closely related to personality, and sentimental expression is a manifestation of personality. Therefore, we propose a novel Persona-driven Sentimental Attentive Recommendation model (named PSAR) via personalized sentimental interactive representation learning for the review-based recommendation. The proposed model is devised to learn fragment-level and sequence-level personalized sentimental representation simultaneously from reviews. Besides, an attentive persona-driven interaction module is designed to capture word-level usage habits and sentence-level analogous tones. Comprehensive experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {The role of text mining based on technological documents such as patents is important in the research field of technology intelligence for technology R&D planning. In addition, WordNet, an English-based lexical database, is widely used for pre-processing text data such as word lemmatization and synonym search. However, technological vocabulary information is complex and specific, and WordNet's ability to analyze technological information is limited in its reflecting technological features. Thus, to improve the text mining performance of technological information, this study proposes a methodology for designing a TechWord-based lexical database that is based on the lexical characteristics of technological words that are differentiated from general words. To do this, we define TechWord, a technology lexical information, and construct a TechSynset, a synonym set between TechWords. First, through dependency parsing between words, TechWord, a unit word that describes a technology, is structured and identifies nouns and verbs. The importance of connectivity is investigated by a network centrality index analysis based on the dependency relations of words. Subsequently, to search for synonyms suitable for the target technology domain, a TechSynset is constructed through synset information, with an additional analysis that calculates cosine similarity based on a word embedding vector. Applying the proposed methodology to the actual technology-related information analysis, we collect patent data on the technological fields of the automotive field, and present the results of the TechWord and TechSynset. This study improves technological information-based text mining by structuring the word-to-word link information in technological documents based on an automated process.},

	abstract = {Mechanisms for collecting unstructured feedback (i.e., text comments) from patients of healthcare providers have become commonplace, but analysis techniques to examine such feedback have not been frequently applied in this domain. To fill this gap, we apply a text mining methodology to a large set of textual feedback of physicians by their patients and relate the textual commentary to their numeric ratings. While perceptions of healthcare service quality in the form of numeric ratings are easy to aggregate, freeform textual commentary presents more challenges to extracting useful information. Our methodology explores aggregation of the textual commentary using a topic analysis procedure (i.e., latent Dirichlet allocation) and a sentiment tool (i.e., Diction). We then explore how the extracted topic areas and expressed sentiments relate to the physicians' quantitative ratings of service quality from both patients and other physicians. We analyze 23,537 numeric ratings plus textual feedback provided by patients of 3,712 physicians who have also been recommended by other physicians, and determine process quality satisfaction is an important driver of patient perceived quality, whereas clinical quality better reflects physician perceived quality. Our findings lead us to suggest that to maximize the usefulness of online reviews of physicians, potential patients should parse them for particular quality elements they wish to assess and interpret them within the scope of those quality elements.},

	abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 brings almost the biggest explosions of scientific literature ever. Facing such volume literature, it is hard for researches to find desired citation when carrying out COVID-19 related research, especially for junior researchers. This paper presents a novel neural network based method, called citation relational BERT with heterogeneous deep graph convolutional network (CRB-HDGCN), for COVID-19 inline citation recommendation task. The CRB-HDGCN contains two main stages. The first stage is to enhance the representation learning of BERT model for COVID-19 inline citation recommendation task through CRB. To achieve the above goal, an augmented citation sentence corpus, which replaces the citation placeholder with the title of the cited papers, is used to lightly retrain BERT model. In addition, we extract three types of sentence pair according citation relation, and establish sentence prediction tasks to further fine-tune the BERT model. The second stage is to learn effective dense vector of nodes among COVID-19 bibliographic graph through HDGCN. The HDGCN contains four layers which are essentially all sub neural networks. The first layer is initial embedding layer which generates initial input vectors with fixed size through CRB and a multilayer perceptron. The second layer is a heterogeneous graph convolutional layer. In this layer, we expand traditional homogeneous graph convolutional network into heterogeneous by subtly adding heterogeneous nodes and relations. The third layer is a deep attention layer. This layer uses trainable project vectors to reweight the node importance simultaneously according to both node types and convolution layers, which further promotes the performance of learnt node vectors. The last decoder layer recovers the graph structure and let the whole network trainable. The recommendation is finally achieved by integrating the high performance heterogeneous vectors learnt from CRB-HDGCN with the query vectors. We conduct experiments on the CORD-19 and LitCovid datasets. The results show that compared with the second best method CO-Search, CRB-HDGCN improves MAP, MRR, P@100 and R@100 with 21.8%, 22.7%, 37.6% and 21.2% on CORD-19, and 29.1%, 25.9%, 15.3% and 11.3% on LitCovid, respectively.},

Any improvement in this process can directly affect the quality of the applications in which knowing the word's senses is important.

In this paper, we propose a novel WSI model that makes use of automatically generated lexical substitutes for a target word to construct a graph and data preparation for the next steps. Following the data preparation step, we make use of Leader--Follower graph clustering to find the basic senses of the target word. The senses of the target word inside the remaining or new upcoming instances will be decided according to their contextual embedding's similarities with the basic sense. Besides, to make the number of found sense groups of a target word much closer to the reality, we apply post-processing at the end.

The current scenario of assigning clinical codes is a manual process which is very expensive, time-consuming and error prone. In recent years, many researchers have studied the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), related machine learning and deep learning methods and techniques to resolve the problem of manual coding of clinical narratives and to assist human coders to assign clinical codes more accurately and efficiently. The main objective of this systematic literature review is to provide a comprehensive overview of automated clinical coding systems that utilise appropriate NLP, machine learning and deep learning methods and techniques to assign the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes to discharge summaries. We have followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and conducted a comprehensive search of publications from January, 2010 to December 2021 in four high quality academic databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, and the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Anthology. We reviewed 6128 publications; 42 met the inclusion criteria. This review identified: 6 datasets having discharge summaries (2 publicly available, 4 acquired from hospitals); 14 NLP techniques along with some other data extraction processes, different feature extraction and embedding techniques. The review also shows that there is a significant increase in the use of deep learning models compared to machine learning. To measure the performance of classification methods, different evaluation metrics are used. Efforts are still required to improve ICD code prediction accuracy, availability of large-scale de-identified clinical corpora with the latest version of the classification system. This can be a platform to guide and share knowledge with the less experienced coders and researchers.},

The clustering of text document plays a vital role for organizing these unstructured text documents. In our paper, we make use of Hybrid Jaya Optimization algorithm (HJO) for text Document Clustering (DC), referred to as HJO-DC. We have used the Silhouette index as a metric to measure the quality of a solution. The proposed work is compared with partitioning techniques such as K-Means and K-Medoids and metaheuristic techniques such as Genetic algorithm, Cuckoo Search, Particle Swarm Optimizer, Firefly and Grey Wolf Optimizer. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm achieves the highest quality clustering in all benchmark examples.},

	abstract = {The explosive growth of textual data on the web and the problem of obtaining desired information through this enormous volume of data has led to a dramatic increase in demand for developing automatic text summarization systems. For this reason, this paper presents a novel multi-document text summarization approach, called MTSQIGA, which extracts salient sentences from source document collection to generate the summary. The proposed generic summarizer models extractive summarization as a binary optimization problem that applies a modified quantum-inspired genetic algorithm (QIGA) in its processing stage to find the best solution. Objective function of our approach plays an important role in optimizing linear combination of coverage, relevance, and redundancy factors which consists of six sentence scoring measures. To ensures the generation of a summary with predefined length limit, the presented QIGA employs a modified quantum measurement and a self-adaptive quantum rotation gate based on the quality and length of the summary. Evaluation of the proposed system was performed on DUC 2005 and 2007 benchmark datasets in terms of ROUGE standard measures. Comparison of MTSQIGA with existing state-of-the-art approaches for multi-document summarization shows superior performance of the proposed systems over other methods on both existing benchmark datasets. It also indicates promising efficiency of our proposed algorithm on applying quantum-inspired genetic algorithm to the text summarization tasks.},

Discovering socially interesting, popular or important locations from a location based social network has recently become important for recommender systems, targeted advertisement applications, and urban planning, etc. However, discovering socially important locations from a social network is challenging due to the data size and variety, spatial and temporal dimensions of the datasets, the need for developing computationally efficient approaches, and the difficulty of modeling human behavior. In the literature, several studies are conducted for discovering socially important locations. However, majority of these studies focused on discovering locations without considering historical data of social media users. They focused on analysis of data of social groups without considering each user's preferences in these groups. In this study, we proposed a method and interest measures to discover socially important locations that consider historical user data and each user's (individual's) preferences. The proposed algorithm was compared with a na{\"\i}ve alternative using real-life Twitter dataset. The results showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the na{\"\i}ve alternative.},

	abstract = {With increasing popularity of social media, Twitter has become one of the leading platforms to report events in real-time. Detecting events from Twitter stream requires complex techniques. Event-related trending topics consist of a group of words which successfully detect and identify events. Event detection techniques must be scalable and robust, so that they can deal with the huge volume and noise associated with social media. Existing event detection methods mostly rely on burstiness, mainly the frequency of words and their co-occurrences. However, burstiness sometimes dominates other relevant details in the data which could be equally significant. Besides, the topological and temporal relationships in the data are often ignored. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based approach, called the Enhanced Heartbeat Graph (EHG), which detects events efficiently. EHG suppresses dominating topics in the subsequent data stream, after their first detection. Experimental results on three real-world datasets (i.e., Football Association Challenge Cup Final, Super Tuesday, and the US Election 2012) show superior performance of the proposed approach in comparison to the state-of-the-art techniques.},

In this respect, we utilized the UOG compliance reports from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection from 2000 to 2019, then established an attentive neural-network framework to support on-site emergency responses. The advantages of attentive-based neural networks over the other mechanisms are that it not only generates powerful contextual vectors for follow-up tasks but also it allows us to observe the importance of violation factors with respect to different scenarios. The experimental results show that our model can extract valid representation from narrative texts in UOG violation compliance reports and achieve high performance in emergency response. At the same time, we obtained two intriguing practical implications: first, geographical and time characteristics are powerful indicators for supporting decision making in UOG on-site emergency responses; second, there is an urgent need for governments to implement different inspection strategies according to unique UOG sites rather than counties concerning specific geological features, which benefits from saving human labor and financial expenditures.},

	abstract = {Formulaic expressions, such as `in this paper we propose', are helpful for authors of scholarly papers because they convey communicative functions; in the above, it is `showing the aim of this paper'. Thus, resources of formulaic expressions, such as a dictionary, that could be looked up easily would be useful. However, forms of formulaic expressions can often vary to a great extent. For example, `in this paper we propose', `in this study we propose' and `in this paper we propose a new method to' are all regarded as formulaic expressions. Such a diversity of spans and forms causes problems in both extraction and evaluation of formulaic expressions. In this paper, we propose a new approach that is robust to variation of spans and forms of formulaic expressions. Our approach regards a sentence as consisting of a formulaic part and non-formulaic part. Then, instead of trying to extract formulaic expressions from a whole corpus, by extracting them from each sentence, different forms can be dealt with at once. Based on this formulation, to avoid the diversity problem, we propose evaluating extraction methods by how much they convey specific communicative functions rather than by comparing extracted expressions to an existing lexicon. We also propose a new extraction method that utilises named entities and dependency structures to remove the non-formulaic part from a sentence. Experimental results show that the proposed extraction method achieved the best performance compared to other existing methods.},

Many technologies, especially deep learning methods, have achieved great success in text analysis. However, the most powerful methods always require a considerable quantity of data for training, which may suffer from imbalanced data in some cases. In this paper, we propose a network-based Convolution Neural Network (NCNN) to mitigate the effect of imbalanced data. The proposed model first generates new synthetic samples for the imbalanced data based on the random walking of the network. Then an extra layer called Polar Layer is introduced to connect the output from the network model of the text to the classical CNN. Two electing strategies (n-NCNN and x-NCNN) are proposed to improve the performance of NCNN further. In the experimental section, the proposed model is applied to Reuters 21578 and WebKb. By comparing with six approaches, we prove the effectiveness of the proposed NCNN model on the imbalanced text data.},

Network objects are characterized by high dimensional attributes and by links indicating the relationships among these objects. However, traditional feature selection and feature extraction methods consider only attribute information, thus ignoring link information. In the presented work, we propose a new unsupervised binary feature construction method (NetBFC) for networked data that reconstructs attributes for each object by exploiting link information. By exploring similar objects in the network and associating them, our method increases the similarities between objects with high probability of being in the same group. The proposed method enables local attribute enrichment and local attribute selection for each object by aggregating the attributes of similar objects in order to deal with the sparsity of networked data. In addition, this method applies an attribute elimination phase to eliminate irrelevant and redundant attributes which decrease the performance of clustering algorithms. Experimental results on real-world data sets indicate that NetBFC significantly achieves better performance when compared to baseline methods.},

	abstract = {Circle structure of online brand communities allows companies to conduct cross-marketing activities by the influence of friends in different circles and build strong and lasting relationships with customers. However, existing works on the friend recommendation in social network do not consider establishing friendships between users in different circles, which has the problems of network sparsity, neither do they study the adaptive generation of appropriate link prediction algorithms for different circle features. In order to fill the gaps in previous works, the intelligent attention allocation link prediction algorithm is proposed to adaptively build attention allocation index (AAI) according to the sparseness of the network and predict the possible friendships between users in different circles. The AAI reflects the amount of attention allocated to the user pair by their common friend in the triadic closure structure, which is decided by the friend count of the common friend. Specifically, for the purpose of overcoming the problem of network sparsity, the AAIs of both the direct common friends and indirect ones are developed. Next, the decision tree (DT) method is constructed to adaptively select the suitable AAIs for the circle structure based on the density of common friends and the dispersion level of common friends' attention. In addition, for the sake of further improving the accuracy of the selected AAI, its complementary AAIs are identified with support vector machine model according to their similarity in value, direction, and ranking. Finally, the mutually complementary indices are combined into a composite one to comprehensively portray the attention distribution of common friends of users in different circles and predict their possible friendships for cross-marketing activities. Experimental results on Twitter and Google+ show that the model has highly reliable prediction performance.},

	abstract = {Image tag recommendation, aiming at assigning a set of relevant tags for images, is a useful way to help users organize images' content. Early methods in image tagging mainly demonstrated using low-level visual features. However, two visually similar photos may have different concepts (semantic gap). Although different multi-view tagging methods are proposed to learn the discriminative features, they usually do not consider the geographical correlation among images. Moreover, geographical-based image tagging models generally focused on the relevance criterion, i.e., how well the suggested tags describe image content. Diversity and redundancy should be controlled to guarantee the recommendation models' effectiveness and promote complementary information among tags. This paper proposes a robust multi-view image tagging method, termed MVDF-RSC, which considers the relevance, diversity, and redundancy criteria. Precisely, the proposed method consists of two phases: training and prediction. We propose a new robust optimization problem in the training phase to determine the similarity between data via the early fusion of multiple views of images and obtain clusters. In the prediction phase, relevant tags are recommended to each test data using a search-based method and a late fusion strategy. Comprehensive experiments on two geo-tagged image datasets demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness over state-of-the-art alternatives.},

	abstract = {Opinion target extraction or aspect extraction is the most important subtask of the aspect-based sentiment analysis. This task focuses on the identification of the targets of user's opinions or sentiments from online reviews. In the recent years, syntactic patterns-based approaches have performed quite well and produced significant improvement in the aspect extraction task. However, these approaches are heavily dependent on the dependency parsers which produced syntactic relations following the grammatical rules and language constraints. In contemporary, users do not give much importance to these rules and constraints while expressing their opinions about particular product and neither reviewer websites restrict users to do so. This makes syntactic patterns-based approaches vulnerable. Therefore, in this paper, we are proposing a two-fold rules-based model (TF-RBM) which uses rules defined on the basis of sequential patterns mined from customer reviews. The first fold extracts aspects associated with domain independent opinions and the second fold extracts aspects associated with domain dependent opinions. We have also applied frequency- and similarity-based approaches to improve the aspect extraction accuracy of the proposed model. Our experimental evaluation has shown better results as compared with the state-of-the-art and most recent approaches.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address two research topics in Recommender Systems (RSs) which have been developed in parallel without a deeper integration: Cross-Domain RS (CDRS) and Context-Aware RS (CARS). CDRS have emerged to enhance the quality of recommendations in a target domain by leveraging sources of information in different domains. CDRS are especially useful to address cold-start, sparsity and diversity problems in target domains with scarce information. CARS, on its turn, have been proposed to consider contextual information for recommendations. Such systems are suitable when the users' interests change according to factors like time, location, among others. By combining these two approaches, better RSs can be developed, considering both the availability of useful data from multiple domains and the use of contextual information. In this paper, we formalize the combination of CDRS and CARS, which represents a more systematic integration of these approaches compared to previous work. Based on this formulation, we developed novel RSs techniques, named CD-CARS. To evaluate the developed CD-CARS techniques, we performed extensive experimentation through real datasets taking into account several scenarios. The recommendations were evaluated in terms of predictive and ranking performance, respectively achieving up to 62.6% and 45%, depending on the scenario, in comparison to traditional cross-domain collaborative filtering techniques. Therefore, the experimental results have shown that the integration of techniques developed in isolation can be useful in a variety of situations, in which recommendations can be improved by information gathered from different sources and can be refined by considering specific contextual information.},

	abstract = {Twitter has become instrumental as a means of spreading information, opinions or awareness about real-world events. The classification of event-related tweets is a challenging problem since tweets are noisy and sparse pieces of text that lack contextual information. Related work proposes contextual enrichment techniques using external sources (e.g. semantic web, external documents), often considering underlying assumptions about the target events. However, they lack guidelines for determining the textual features to enrich, the external sources to use, the properties to explore, and how to prevent the inclusion of unrelated information. In this paper, we propose a hybrid semantic enrichment framework for the classification of event-related tweets. We contribute to this field by leveraging different contextual enrichment strategies into a unifying framework targeted at a broad range of event types, where each enrichment technique has a role in the improvement of event classification. The framework also encompasses a solution to deal with the huge number of features that result from semantic enrichment, which combines a pruning method to select domain relevant semantic features and general-purpose feature selection techniques. We assessed the contribution of each framework component to event classification improvement using a broad experimental setting. Using seven events of distinct natures, we outperformed a word embeddings baseline in 93.6% of cases, and a textual baseline in 60.3% of cases. In most cases, we improved the recall, with no significant impact on the precision.},

	abstract = {Human gesture recognition has become a pillar of today's intelligent Human-Computer Interfaces as it typically provides more comfortable and ubiquitous interaction. Such expert system has a promising prospect in various applications, including smart houses, gaming, healthcare, and robotics. However, recognizing human gestures in videos is one of the most challenging topics in computer vision, because of some irrelevant environmental factors like complex background, occlusion, lighting conditions, and so on. With the recent development of deep learning, many researchers have addressed this problem by building single deep networks to learn spatiotemporal features from video data. However, the performance is still unsatisfactory due to the limitation that the single deep networks are incapable of handling these challenges simultaneously. Hence, the extracted features cannot efficiently capture both relevant shape information and detailed spatiotemporal variation of the gestures. One solution to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks is to fuse multiple features from different models learned on multiple vision cues. Aiming at this objective, we present in this paper an effective multi-dimensional feature learning approach, termed as MultiD-CNN, for human gesture recognition in RGB-D videos. The key to our design is to learn high-level gesture representations by taking advantages from Convolutional Residual Networks (ResNets) for training extremely deep models and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (ConvLSTM) for dealing with time-series connections. More specifically, we first construct an architecture to simultaneously learn the spatiotemporal features from RGB and depth sequences through 3D ResNets which are then linked to a ConvLSTM to capture the temporal dependencies between them, and we show that they better combine appearance and motion information effectively. Second, to alleviate distractions from background and other variations, we propose a method that encodes the temporal information into a motion representation, while a two-stream architecture based on 2D-ResNets is then employed to extract deep features from this representation. Third, we investigate different fusion strategies at different levels for blending the classification results, and we show that integrating multiple ways of encoding the spatial and temporal information leads to a robust and stable spatiotemporal feature learning with better generalization capability. Finally, we perform different experiments to evaluate the performance of the investigated architectures on four kinds of challenging datasets, demonstrating that our approach is particularly impressive where it outperforms prior arts in both accuracy and efficiency. The obtained results affirm also the importance of embedding the proposed approach in other intelligent systems application areas.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a max-margin multi-scale convolutional factor analysis (MMCFA) model, which explores the strongly discriminative principle of max-margin learning to improve the classification performance of multi-scale convolutional factor analysis (CFA) model with application to image data classification. Compared with the traditional factor analysis (FA) model, the CFA model can maintain the spatial correlation among the image pixels in two-dimensional space and capture the structural information from images via convolution kernels. Moreover, to extract multi-level features, multi-scale convolution kernels are adopted to capture richer features at different scales of images. Since the unsupervised model may not offer discriminative factors for the classification task, it is expected to introduce the supervised information to the multi-scale CFA model when supervised information is available. To deal with it, a latent variable support vector machine (LVSVM) is linked to the factors learned from multi-scale CFA model, yielding max-margin discrimination, as the classification criterion in the feature space in our proposed model. The multi-scale CFA model and LVSVM learn parameters jointly in a united framework via the Gibbs inference. Experimental results on mixed national institute of standards and technology (MNIST) dataset, Fashion-MNIST dataset, SVHN dataset and measured synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images show that the learned convolution kernels and factors can describe data information well and the proposed model has excellent classification performance.},

Most of the existing methods leverage the power of deep learning to produce a representation of text. However, these models do not consider about the problem that text itself is usually semantically ambiguous and reflects limited information. Due to this reason, it is necessary to seek help from external knowledge base to better understand text. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Text Concept Vector which leverages both the neural network and the knowledge base to produce a high quality representation of text. Formally, a raw text is primarily conceptualized and represented by a set of concepts through a large taxonomy knowledge base. After that, a neural network is used to transform the conceptualized text into a vector form which encodes both the semantic information and the concept information of the original text. We test our framework on both the sentence level task and the document level task. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our work.},

	abstract = {Usually, computerized assessments of constructed responses use a predictive-centered approach instead of a validity-centered one. Here, we compared the convergent and discriminant validity of two computerized assessment methods designed to detect semantic topics in constructed responses: Inbuilt Rubric (IR) and Partial Contents Similarity (PCS). While both methods are distributional models of language and use the same Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) prior knowledge, they produce different semantic representations. PCS evaluates constructed responses using non-meaningful semantic dimensions (this method is the standard LSA assessment of constructed responses), but IR endows original LSA semantic space coordinates with meaning. In the present study, 255 undergraduate and high school students were allocated one of three texts and were tasked to make a summary. A topic-detection task was conducted comparing IR and PCS methods. Evidence from convergent and discriminant validity was found in favor of the IR method for topic-detection in computerized constructed response assessments. In this line, the multicollinearity of PCS method was larger than the one of IR method, which means that the former is less capable of discriminating between related concepts or meanings. Moreover, the semantic representations of both methods were qualitatively different, that is, they evaluated different concepts or meanings. The implications of these automated assessment methods are also discussed. First, the meaningful coordinates of the Inbuilt Rubric method can accommodate expert rubrics for computerized assessments of constructed responses improving computer-assisted language learning. Second, they can provide high-quality computerized feedback accurately detecting topics in other educational constructed response assessments. Thus, it is concluded that: (1) IR method can represent different concepts and contents of a text, simultaneously mapping a considerable variability of contents in constructed responses; (2) IR method semantic representations have a qualitatively different meaning than the LSA ones and present a desirable multicollinearity that promotes the discriminant validity of the scores of distributional models of language; and (3) IR method can extend the performance and the applications of current LSA semantic representations by endowing the dimensions of the semantic space with semantic meanings.},

	abstract = {Nonnegative Matrix Factorization is a data analysis method to discover parts-based, linear representations of data. It has been successfully used in a great variety of applications. Deep Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (deep NMF) was recently established to cope with the extraction of hierarchical latent feature representation, and it has been demonstrated to achieve outstanding results in unsupervised representation learning. However, defining a suitable regularization for the deep models is a key challenge, and the existing Deep NMF approaches lack a well-suited regularization. In this paper, we propose the Deep Autoencoder-like NMF with Contrastive Regularization and Feature Relationship preservation (DANMF-CRFR) to address the above problem. Inspired by contrastive learning, this deep model is able to learn discriminative and instructive deep features while adequately enforcing the local and global structures of the data to its decoder and encoder components. Meanwhile, DANMF-CRFR also imposes feature correlations on the basis matrices during feature learning to improve part-based learning capabilities. Multiplicative updating rules and convergence guarantees are also provided. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model.

	abstract = {Due to the huge size of the data accumulated on microblogging sites, recently, two fundamental questions have become very popular: 1) What percentage of this accumulated data has positive or negative sentiment polarity? 2) How is the distribution of this accumulated data on different topics? Inspired by these motivated necessities, this paper presents several different algorithms which are based on the Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) in order to handle previously mentioned two fundamentals tasks: sentiment polarity detection task and topic-based text classification task. These algorithms are the Label Propagated- Relevance Frequency Classifier (LP-RFC) and LP-Abstract Frequency Classifier (LP-AFC). These algorithms can be defined as new semantic smoothing classifiers, which take advantage of the semantic connections among terms in the label propagation phase of the LPA. Additionally, another classifier, namely LP-ComRFC+AFC, was built. LP-ComRFC+AFC is actually a weighted summation classifier of the individual LP-RFC and LP-AFC. Furthermore, considering the shortage of labeled data in real-world scenarios, a semi-supervised version of LP-RFC and LP-AFC, namely ``Merging Unlabeled and Labeled Instances with Semantic Values of Terms'' (MULIS), was designed and implemented. For the experiments of the sentiment polarity detection task, three different datasets were use and for the experiments of topic-based text classification task, a self-collected tweet dataset was use. According to the experimental results, the suggested algorithms, and their composite form, LP-ComRFC+AFC, generated higher F1 scores than all of the baseline algorithms at nearly all of the training splits on the datasets.},

	abstract = {This work presents a text mining context and its use for a deep analysis of the messages delivered by politicians. Specifically, we deal with an expert systems-based exploration of the rhetoric dynamics of a large collection of US Presidents' speeches, ranging from Washington to Trump. In particular, speeches are viewed as complex expert systems whose structures can be effectively analyzed through rank-size laws. The methodological contribution of the paper is twofold. First, we develop a text mining-based procedure for the construction of the dataset by using a web scraping routine on the Miller Center website -- the repository site collecting the speeches. Second, we explore the implicit structure of the discourse data by implementing a rank-size procedure over the individual speeches, being the words of each speech ranked in terms of their frequencies. The scientific significance of the proposed combination of text-mining and rank-size approaches can be found in its flexibility and generality, which let it be reproducible to a wide set of expert systems and text mining contexts. The usefulness of the proposed method and of the speeches analysis is demonstrated by the findings themselves. Indeed, in terms of impact, it is worth noting that interesting conclusions of social, political and linguistic nature on how 45 United States Presidents, from April 30, 1789 till February 28, 2017 delivered political messages can be carried out. Indeed, the proposed analysis shows some remarkable regularities, not only inside a given speech, but also among different speeches. Moreover, under a purely methodological perspective, the presented contribution suggests possible ways of generating a linguistic decision-making algorithm.},

Most of the existing deep learning models for text classification face difficulties when the length of the input text increases. Most models work well on shorter text inputs, however, their performance degrades with the increase in the input length. In this work, we introduce a model for text classification that can alleviate this problem. We present the hierarchical and lateral multiple timescales gated recurrent units (HL-MTGRU), in combination with pre-trained encoders to address the long text classification problem. HL-MTGRU can represent multiple temporal scale dependencies for the discrimination task. By combining the slow and fast units of the HL-MTGRU, our model effectively classifies long multi-sentence texts into the desired classes. We also show that the HL-MTGRU structure helps the model to prevent degradation of performance on longer text inputs. We demonstrate that the proposed network with the help of the latest pre-trained encoders for feature extraction outperforms the conventional models on various long text classification benchmark datasets.},

	abstract = {Among internet and smart device applications, Twitter has become a leading social media platform, disseminating online events occurring in the world on a real-time basis. Many studies have been conducted to identify valuable information on Twitter. Recently, Frequent Pattern Mining has been applied for topic detection on Twitter. In Frequent Pattern Mining, a topic is considered to be a group of words that appear simultaneously, however, the method only considers the frequency of words, and their utility for topic detection is not considered in the process of pattern generation. In this paper, we propose a method to detect emerging topics on Twitter based on High Utility Pattern Mining (HUPM), which takes frequency and utility into account at the same time. For a chunk of tweets by time-based windowing on the Twitter stream, we define the utility of words based on the growth rate in frequency and find groups of words with high frequency and high utility by HUPM. For post-processing to extract actual topic patterns from candidate topic patterns generated by HUPM, an efficient data structure called Topic-tree (TP-Tree) is also proposed. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method, which showed superior performance and shorter running time than other tested topic detection methods. In particular, the proposed method showed a 5% higher topic recall than the other compared methods for the three datasets used.},

	abstract = {One of the areas most in need of improvement in the field of automated bug fixing, localization and triaging systems is that of an effective categorization, as this would bugs to reduce the time, cost and effort required to locate, assign and fix the bug. The existing approaches depend upon the textual similarity of the bug description and category in a given reported bug; accordingly, the challenges of unstructured bugs, technical terms, versatile ways of reporting the same bug, the diverse nature and sizes of datasets etc. are often overlooked. Consequently, this limits the classifier performance to a specific type of dataset, resulting in classification inefficiency. To this end, we propose a novel Self-Paced Bug Classifier (SPBC) that is capable of locating the target categories from the bug description of the historical data, maintained by multiple open-source software packages (Bugzilla, Mentis, Redmine). The proposed model introduces a self-paced back-traceable algorithm, controlled by a self-paced regularizer, which classifies textually independent bug descriptions with weighted data-independent tokens (the easy samples). Later on, the regularizer sets comparatively hard samples for textually dependent classification by capturing intra-class and inter-class discrimination features from bug descriptions, based on the weighted similarities of words; this is done with the help of a Key Feature Identification Matrix (KFIM), a Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (NIID) matrix. Easy-to-hard self-pace learning, integrated with textually dependent and independent classification, makes SPBC capable of simultaneously enhancing the effectiveness and robustness of intelligent systems through a substantial increase in precision (5--15% on average). The main advantage of SPBC is that it targets the spatial relationship between the data and the system, which makes it an apt learner of data and allows it to maintains sample insertion into the classifier at a controlled pace. Additionally, it maintains stability, which is not affected by the dataset's dimensionality and traits. As is evidenced by the experimental results on four different datasets from open-source projects, our model outperforms the baseline and state-of-the-art methods through a single-stroke solution with improved accuracy and stable performance (average 95% precision and 4% decrease in kappa); hence, it is significant for improving intelligent bug fixing and triaging systems.},

	abstract = {Object Bank (OB) is a high-level image representation encoding semantic and spacial information, and has superior performance in scene classification tasks. However, the dimensionality of OB feature is high, which demands massive computation. Existing dimensionality reduction methods for OB are incapable of achieving both high classification accuracy and substantial dimensionality reduction simultaneously. In order to solve this problem, we propose a threshold value filter pooling method to avoid noise accumulation in histogram-pooling and represent more useful information than max-pooling. We also propose a Matthew effect normalization method to highlight the useful information, and thus boost the performance of OB-based image scene classification. Finally, we apply these two methods in a dimensionality reduction framework to simplify OB representation and construct more proper descriptors, and thus achieve both dimensionality reduction and classification accuracy increase. We evaluated our framework on three real-world datasets, namely, event dataset UIUC-Sports, natural scene dataset LabelMe, and mixture dataset 15-Scenes. The classification results demonstrate that our framework not only obtains accuracies similar to or higher than the original OB representation, but also reduces the dimensionality significantly. The computational complexity analysis shows that it can reduce the time complexity of classification. Therefore, our framework can improve OB-based image scene classification through both computational complexity reduction and accuracy increase.},

	abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most successful recommendation techniques due to its simplicity and attractive accuracy. However, existing CF methods fail to interpret the reasons why they recommend a new item. In this paper, we propose a Contextual-boosted Deep Neural Collaborative filtering (CDNC) model for item recommendation, which simultaneously exploits both item introductions (textual features) and user ratings (collaborative features) to alleviate the cold-start problem and provide interpretable item recommendation. Specifically, we propose an interactive attention mechanism to learn the user representation, which makes use of the mutual information from both the user ratings and item introductions to supervise the representation learning of each other. With the learned attention weights, we can obtain the importance of each historical item among the historical list. Meanwhile, the attention model can assign different weights to the words in item introductions according to their importance. Therefore, CDNC can provide interpretations for the recommendations by assigning different attention weights to the historically interacted items and the words in the item introductions. On the other hand, we also learn the distributed representations of new-coming items with deep neural networks (i.e., LSTM), considering both rating and item introduction information. Finally, the user representation and the representations of new-coming item are concatenated to perform recommendation score prediction. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CDNC. In addition, CDNC has the advantage of interpreting the recommendations and providing user profiles for down-stream applications.},

Tourists are facing a range of difficulties as they select suitable tours, consisting of several itineraries in terms of their interests and distinct constraints. An itinerary consists of many Points of Interest (POIs) and a POI can further be splitted into several attractions which are named as POI within POI. For selecting the itinerary, the existing techniques use the characteristics of POIs. However, a POI consists of many attractions. Out of these, one dominating attraction's type is considered as POI type. This ignores the other type of attraction's present in that POI. It may cause improper selection of itineraries. Therefore, selection of itineraries by considering POI within POI is of great benefit. But, it is very challenging. For this task, we suggest an algorithm called PWP. It recommends multiple itineraries that are based on the interest of visitors, popularity of itineraries and the cost of itineraries. If a tourist wants to visit unknown areas, the PWP algorithm can be expanded further. We have taken the similar user's features to advise multiple itineraries using the Flickr dataset. The findings show that the proposed PWP algorithm out-performs the baseline algorithms in terms of real-life matrices and heuristic based metrics.},

A large number of journals have various acceptance rates, impact factors, and rankings in different publishers. It becomes time-consuming for many researchers to select the most suitable journal to submit their work with the highest acceptance rate. A paper submission recommendation system is more critical for the research community and publishers as it gives scientists another support to complete their submission conveniently. This paper investigates the submission recommendation system for two main research topics: computer science and applied mathematics. Unlike the previous works (Wang et al., 2018; Son et al., 2020) that extract TF--IDF and statistical features as well as utilize numerous machine learning algorithms (logistics regression and multiple perceptrons) for building the recommendation engine, we present an efficient paper submission recommendation algorithm by using different bidirectional transformer encoders and the Mixture of Transformer Encoders technique. We compare the performance between our methodology and other approaches by one dataset from Wang et al. (2018) with 14012 papers in computer science and another dataset collected by us with 223,782 articles in 178 Springer applied mathematics journals in terms of top K accuracy (K=1,3,5,10). The experimental results show that our proposed method extensively outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques with a significant margin in all top K accuracy for both two datasets.

The framework, based on NLP and network analysis techniques, is capable of determining the strengths of an institution in different thematic areas within a field and thereby determining the core competency and potential core competency areas of that institution. It makes use of recently proposed expertise indices such as x and x(g) indices for determination of core and potential core competency areas and can toss two kinds of recommendations: (i) for enhancement of strength of strong areas or core competency areas of an institution and (ii) for complementing the potentially strong areas or potential core competency areas of an institution. A major advantage of the system is that it can help to determine and improve the research portfolio of an institution within a field through suitable collaboration, which may lead to the overall improvement of the performance of the institution in that field. The framework is demonstrated by analyzing the performance of 195 Indian institutions in the field of `Computer Science'. Upon validation using standard metrics for novelty, coverage and diversity of recommendation systems, the framework is found to be of sufficient coverage and capable of tossing novel and diverse recommendations. The article thus presents an institutional collaboration recommendation system which can be used by institutions to identify potential collaborators.},

	abstract = {A latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model is a machine learning technique to identify latent topics from text corpora within a Bayesian hierarchical framework. Current popular inferential methods to fit the LDA model are based on variational Bayesian inference, collapsed Gibbs sampling, or a combination of these. Because these methods assume a unimodal distribution over topics, however, they can suffer from large bias when text corpora consist of various clusters with different topic distributions. This paper proposes an inferential LDA method to efficiently obtain unbiased estimates under flexible modeling for heterogeneous text corpora with the method of partial collapse and the Dirichlet process mixtures. The method is illustrated using a simulation study and an application to a corpus of 1300 documents from neural information processing systems (NIPS) conference articles during the period of 2000--2002 and British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) news articles during the period of 2004--2005.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical classification is an effective approach to categorization of large-scale text data. We introduce a relaxed strategy into the traditional hierarchical classification method to improve the system performance. During the process of hierarchy structure construction, our method delays node judgment of the uncertain category until it can be classified clearly. This approach effectively alleviates the `block' problem which transfers the classification error from the higher level to the lower level in the hierarchy structure. A new term weighting approach based on the Least Information Theory (LIT) is adopted for the hierarchy classification. It quantifies information in probability distribution changes and offers a new document representation model where the contribution of each term can be properly weighted. The experimental results show that the relaxation approach builds a more reasonable hierarchy and further improves classification performance. It also outperforms other classification methods such as SVM (Support Vector Machine) in terms of efficiency and the approach is more efficient for large-scale text classification tasks. Compared to the classic term weighting method TF*IDF, LIT-based methods achieves significant improvement on the classification performance.},

	abstract = {Detecting key story elements such as protagonist, opponent, desire, turning points, battle, and victory, etc. is essential for various narrative work applications including content retrieval and content recommendation systems. The task of automatically identifying story elements is challenging because of its complexity and subjectiveness and currently, there are no available algorithms for this task. In this paper, we focus on identifying turning points in a story of a cartoon movie. The proposed methodology extends the novel two-clocks theory, originally validated on scripts of theatre plays, to video stories. The assumption behind the two-clocks theory is that the perception of time is different when some special event happens to a certain agent (e.g., time flows slower for a patient and quicker for a tourist). The story timeline is monitored with two clocks: an event clock, which measures the regular time flow of the story; and a weighted clock, which measures the timing of the story events. We have conducted an experiment on 28 episodes of a cartoon series and achieved promising results: 78.6% precision for turning points identification and 100% precision for key scene detection. The proposed approach is the first step towards development of intelligent systems for automated understanding of stories in narrative works such as cinema movies and even amateur videos uploaded to the Internet.},

While efforts have been made to provide a way of data-driven case-based reasoning (CBR), existing studies have limitations in reflecting lead users' characteristics into the CBR process. Current research has emphasized the retrieval and adaptation phase only, which retrieves, reuses, and revises cases. However, what is at the core of lead user characteristics is to find out the problem, and solve the problem by themselves before mass customers. This means CBR needs to focus on uncovering and defining problems and finding relevant solutions for designated problems. In response, this research suggests a novel approach for problem-oriented CBR approach to reflect lead user characteristics. First, this study defines problems, by extracting problem--solution sets related to the specific function using sentiment analysis. Second, this study improves case representation and case retrieval using subject-action-object (SAO) analysis and technology tree respectively. This study demonstrates the approach through a case of drone technology using lead user communities (diydrones.com), and our findings suggest that the approach can help firms broaden the knowledge of existing products to make an improvement.},

	abstract = {In view of the rise in security and privacy concern in social networks, there has been an inadvertent increase in research related to framing of appropriate measures to detect the security breaches in social networks. Cyber criminals are misusing social networking platforms for inappropriate and illegitimate purposes such as posting or sending of illegitimate content which a genuine user will rarely do. Hence, whenever a sensitive and unusual text is posted by a user, there is a need to authenticate whether it is posted by the legitimate owner of the account or some imposter who might have compromised the legitimate profile. The process of authentication called authorship verification helps to handle the same. In this paper, authorship verification has been performed using different textual features such as n-grams, Bag of words (BOW), stylometric and folksonomy features to examine the authorship of tweets posted by the users on the microblogging platform Twitter. Appropriate classification and statistical analysis techniques have been applied to compute different performance parameters. From the experimental analysis, an important observation found is that though char n-grams have an upper hand to other features, still other applicable measures such as word n-grams, BOW, stylometric and folksonomy features cannot be overlooked as each user maintained consistency in different set of features. Accordingly, different feature selection techniques have been used to rank and select best feature for each user. From the comparative analysis of various similarity and statistical based feature selection techniques it is observed that AHP weighted TOPSIS method surpassed others in terms of different performance parameters. Further computation as per ranked features helped to improve the result by achieving an overall average F-score value of 93.82%.},

As a result of the application of RNP methods with sentence selection, an increase in accuracy between 6.6% and 8.76% was achieved in answer detection.

It first searches all keyphrase candidates from the document, and then ranks them for selecting top-N ones as final keyphrases. Existing studies show that extracting a complete keyphrase candidate set that includes semantic relations in context, and evaluating the effectiveness of each candidate are crucial to extract high quality keyphrases from documents. Based on that words do not repeatedly appear in an effective keyphrase in English, a novel keyphrase candidate search algorithm using sequential pattern mining with gap constraints (called KCSP) is proposed to extract keyphrase candidates for KeyRank. And then an effectiveness evaluation measure pattern frequency with entropy (called PF-H) is proposed for KeyRank to rank these keyphrase candidates. Our experimental results show that KeyRank has better performance. Its first component KCSP is much more efficient than a closely related approach SPMW, and its second component PF-H is an effective evaluation mechanism for ranking keyphrase candidates.11Our two-page extended abstract is published in AAAI 2017 (Wang, Sheng, & Wu, 2017).},

	abstract = {Citation recommendation can help researchers quickly find supplementary or alternative references in massive academic resources. Current research on citation recommendation mainly focuses on the citing papers, resulting in the enormous cited papers are ignored, including the relations among cited papers and their citation context cited in citing papers. Moreover, cited paper's content is often denoted with its original title and abstract, which is hard to acquire and rarely considers different citation motivations. Furthermore, the most appropriate method for semantic representation of cited papers' relations and content is uncertain. Therefore, this paper studies citation recommendation from the perspective of semantic representation of cited papers' relations and content. Firstly, four forms of citation context are designed and extracted as cited papers' content considering citation motivations, as well as co-citation relationships are extracted as cited papers' relations. Secondly, 132 methods are designed for generating semantic vector of cited paper, including four network embedding methods, 16 methods by combining four text representation algorithms with four forms of citation content, and 112 fusion methods. Finally, similarity among cited papers is calculated for citation recommendation and a quantitative evaluation method based on link prediction is designed, to find the most appropriate form of citation content and the optimal method. The result shows that doc2vecC (Document to Vector through Corruption) with the form of CS&SS (Current Sentences and Surrounding Sentences) performs best, in which the AUC (Area Under Curve) and MAP (Macro Average Precision) reach 0.877 and 0.889 and have increased by 0.462 and 0.370 compared with the worst-performing method. This performance is slightly improved by parameters adjustment, and a case study is performed whose results have further proved the effectiveness of this method. In addition, among four forms of cited papers' content, CS&SS performs best in almost all methods. Furthermore, the fusion methods not always perform better than the single methods, where doc2vecC (CS&SS) performs better than the best fusion method GCN (Graph Convolutional Network). These results not only prove the effectiveness of citation recommendation from the perspective of cited paper, but also provide helpful and useful suggestions for method selection and citation content selection. The data and conclusions can be extended to other text mining-related tasks. Simultaneously, it is a preliminary research which needs to be further studied in other domains using emerging semantic representation methods.},

Researchers have been trying to improve ATS techniques since the 1950s. ATS approaches are either extractive, abstractive, or hybrid. The extractive approach selects the most important sentences in the input document(s) then concatenates them to form the summary. The abstractive approach represents the input document(s) in an intermediate representation then generates the summary with sentences that are different than the original sentences. The hybrid approach combines both the extractive and abstractive approaches. Despite all the proposed methods, the generated summaries are still far away from the human-generated summaries. Most researches focus on the extractive approach. It is required to focus more on the abstractive and hybrid approaches. This research provides a comprehensive survey for the researchers by presenting the different aspects of ATS: approaches, methods, building blocks, techniques, datasets, evaluation methods, and future research directions.},

	abstract = {Recently, deep learning has dominated the recommender system, as it is able to effectively capture nonlinear and nontrivial user--item relationships, and perform complex nonlinear transformations. However, there are still some issues with respects to the existing methods. Firstly, they always treat user--item interactions independently, and may fail to cover more complex and hidden information that is inherently implicit in the local neighborhood surrounding an interaction sample. Secondly, by quantifying the dependence degree of user--item sequences, it demonstrates that both short-term and long-term dependent behavioral patterns co-exist. Unfortunately, typical deep learning methods might be problematic when coping with very long-term sequential dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a novel unified neural collaborative recommendation algorithm that capitalizes on memory networks for learning attention embedding from implicit interaction (NCRAE). Particularly, the attention is capable of learning the relative importance of different users and items from user--item interaction sequences, which provides a better solution for concentrating on inputs and helps to better memorize long-term sequential dependencies. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show significant improvements of our proposed NCRAE algorithm over the competitive methods. Empirical evidence shows that using memory networks for learning attention embeddings of users' implicit interaction yields better recommendation performance.},

	abstract = {Social media data can be valuable in many ways. However, the vast amount of content shared and the linguistic variants of languages used on social media are making it very challenging for high-value topics to be identified. In this paper, we present an unsupervised multilingual approach for identifying highly relevant terms and topics from the mass of social media data. This approach combines term ranking, localised language analysis, unsupervised topic clustering and multilingual sentiment analysis to extract prominent topics through analysis of Twitter's tweets from a period of time. It is observed that each of the ranking methods tested has their strengths and weaknesses, and that our proposed `Joint' ranking method is able to take advantage of the strengths of the ranking methods. This `Joint' ranking method coupled with an unsupervised topic clustering model is shown to have the potential to discover topics of interest or concern to a local community. Practically, being able to do so may help decision makers to gauge the true opinions or concerns on the ground. Theoretically, the research is significant as it shows how an unsupervised online topic identification approach can be designed without much manual annotation effort, which may have great implications for future development of expert and intelligent systems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose SummCoder, a novel methodology for generic extractive text summarization of single documents. The approach generates a summary according to three sentence selection metrics formulated by us: sentence content relevance, sentence novelty, and sentence position relevance. The sentence content relevance is measured using a deep auto-encoder network, and the novelty metric is derived by exploiting the similarity among sentences represented as embeddings in a distributed semantic space. The sentence position relevance metric is a hand-designed feature, which assigns more weight to the first few sentences through a dynamic weight calculation function regulated by the document length. Furthermore, a sentence ranking and a selection technique are developed to generate the document summary by ranking the sentences according to the final score obtained through the fusion of the three sentences selection metrics. We also introduce a new summarization benchmark, Tor Illegal Documents Summarization (TIDSumm) dataset, especially to assist Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), that contains two sets of ground truth summaries, manually created, for 100 web documents extracted from onion websites in Tor (The Onion Router) network. Empirical results show that, on DUC 2002, on Blog Summarization, and on TIDSumm datasets, our text summarization approach obtains comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art methods for different ROUGE metrics.},

	abstract = {Session-based recommendation (SBR) is a practical task that predicts the next item based on an anonymous behavior sequence. Most of current methods employ graph neural network to model neighboring item transition information from global and local contexts (i.e, other and current sessions). However, they treat neighbors from other sessions equally without considering its items, which may have different contributions with the target item on varied aspects. In other words, they have not explored finer-granularity transition information in the global context, leading to sub-optimal performance. This paper fills this gap by proposing a novel method called Transition Information Enhanced Disentangled Graph Neural Network (TIE-DGNN) to capture finer-granular transition information between items and try to interpret the transition reason by modeling various factors of items. Specifically, we first propose a position-aware global graph to model neighboring item transition in the global context. Then, we slice item embeddings into blocks, each of which represents a factor, and use global-level disentangling layers to separately learn factor embeddings. Meanwhile, we train local-level item embeddings by using attention mechanisms to capture transition information from the current session. Further, inter-session and intra-session embeddings are generated by two types of item embeddings, respectively. Finally, we use contrastive learning techniques to enhance the robustness of two session embeddings. To this end, our model considers two levels of transition information. Especially in global context, it not only consider finer-granularity transition information between items but also take user intents at factor-level into account to interpret the key reason for the transition. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.},

Early detection of HF plays a vital role in saving lives through adjusting lifestyles and drug interventions that can slow down disease progression or prevent HF. There are many cardiovascular risk factors associated with HF, and they often coexist. In this paper, we assess the predictive value of pathological factors for early HF detection through a social network based approach. We use electronic health records (collected from the project HeartCarer) and compute the similarity of risk factors. The similarity values are used to construct an unweighted and a weighted medical social network. The constructed medical social network is further divided into a HF high-risk group and HF low-risk group using a group division algorithm. Patients in the high-risk group will be suggested for early screening. To evaluate the prediction value of our method, we perform four experiments based on real world data. The results demonstrate the high effectiveness of our method on heart failure risk assessment, with the best accuracy close to 90%.},

Indeed, it helps customers in buying decisions and represents a valuable feedback for the companies, allowing them to improve their productions. However, numerous greedy companies resort to fake reviews in order to influence the customer and brighten the brand image, or to defame the one of their competitors. Various models are proposed in order to detect deceptive opinion reviews. Most of these models adopt traditional methods focusing on feature extraction and traditional classifiers. Unfortunately, these models do not capture the semantic aspect while ignoring the opinion's context. In order to tackle this issue, we propose a new approach based on Paragraph Vector Distributed Bag of Words (PV-DBOW) and the Denoising Autoencoder (DAE). The proposed customized model provides a strong representation which is based on a global representation of the opinions while preserving their semantics. Indeed, the embedding vectors capture the semantic meaning of all words in the context of each opinion. The generated review representations are fed into a fully connected neural network in order to detect deceptive opinion spam. The obtained results concerning the deception dataset show that our model is effective and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methodologies.},

In this paper, we pay heed to the growing interest in integrating context-awareness and multi-criteria decision making in recommender systems, to deal with the most pressing challenges in music recommender systems, namely the diversity of the recommended playlist, the scalability of the system, and the cold start problem. This paper introduces a new multi-criteria recommendation approach, named MORec, which generates Top-N music recommendations by bootstrapping the system using beforehand collected data. We usher by gauging the relevance of contextual information from the relation between three elements: user, music genre, and the user's context. Then, we apply an aggregation technique to uncover the relationship between the context and the overall rating. Besides, we apply the K-means algorithm to generate a predictive model that comprises clusters of similar contexts defining the association between contextual dimensions and music genres. Carried out experiments emphasize very promising results of our approach in terms of clustering quality, compared to the Partitioning Around Medoids algorithm in terms of connectivity and stability. The comparison versus pioneering recommendation baselines underscored the effectiveness of MORec in terms of recommendation quality and usefulness.},

	abstract = {A limitation of many probabilistic topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is their inflexibility to use local contexts. As a result, these models cannot directly benefit from short-distance co-occurrences, which are more likely to be indicators of meaningful word relationships. Some models such as the Bigram Topic Model (BTM) consider local context by integrating language and topic models. However, due to taking the exact word order into account, such models suffer severely from sparseness. Some other models like Latent Dirichlet Co-Clustering (LDCC) try to solve the problem by adding another level of granularity assuming a document as a bag of segments, while ignoring the word order. In this paper, we introduce a new topic model which uses overlapping windows to encode local word relationships. In the proposed model, we assume a document is comprised of fixed-size overlapping windows, and formulate a new generative process accordingly. In the inference procedure, each word is sampled once in only a single window, while influencing the sampling of its other fellow co-occurring words in other windows. Word relationships are discovered in the document level, but the topic of each word is derived considering only its neighbor words in a window, to emphasize local word relationships. By using overlapping windows, without assuming an explicit dependency between adjacent words, we avoid ignoring the word order completely. The proposed model is straightforward, not severely prone to sparseness and as the experimental results show, produces more meaningful and more coherent topics compared to the three mentioned established models.},

Humans can never annotate such massive data, and with a growing divide between the daily produced data and those annotated, the only alternative is to mechanize it. Automatic annotation process helps in saving resources in terms of time and cost. The process of multi-label annotation involves associating a document with multiple relevant labels. This paper proposes an unsupervised model to annotate corpus using multi-labels automatically. The model is based on multi-label topic modeling and genetic algorithm (GA). Topic modeling is a technique to extract the hidden topics from text, and the GA is used to find the optimal number of topics. We hyper-tuned the parameters of the topic modeling using two different training methods: variational Bayes and Gibbs sampling. The class imbalance in a corpus can affect the result of topic modeling, where the majority class dominates the minority class. We overcome this problem using the partitioning method. Though the proposed model was developed for the Arabic dataset, it is language neutral. We tested our model on three large Arabic corpora and three large English social media datasets. For the Arabic language, our work being the first work that tackles multi-label annotation, we needed a reference to compare our model. For the Arabic corpus, we compared the result of automatic annotation against humans using crowdsourcing (whose labeling was checked for quality). The analysis of the annotation shows an agreement among models (machine vs. human) of 79.30%. Moreover, for the English dataset, the results are quite competitive.},

	abstract = {With the increase of online customer opinions in specialised websites and social networks, automatic systems to help organise and classify customer reviews by domain-specific aspect categories and sentiment polarity are more needed than ever. Supervised approaches for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis achieve good results for the domain and language they are trained on, but manually labelling data to train supervised systems for all domains and languages is very costly and time consuming. In this work, we describe W2VLDA, an almost unsupervised system based on topic modelling that, combined with some other unsupervised methods and a minimal configuration step, performs aspect category classification, aspect-term and opinion-word separation and sentiment polarity classification for any given domain and language. We evaluate its domain aspect and sentiment classification performance in the multilingual SemEval 2016 task 5 (ABSA) dataset. We show competitive results for several domains (hotels, restaurants, electronic devices) and languages (English, Spanish, French and Dutch).},

Changes in the volume of documents classified into one category could be a sign of a new emerging structure, which therefore gives clues on the need to update the classification scheme. In this paper, we present a method based on forecasting techniques, change detection and time series monitoring in order to raise alerts as soon as a change occurs in the volume of a given category. We build features only based on the textual content that enable us to accurately predict the expected temporal evolution of such category. Then, we use statistical process control to determine if the current volume is too far away from the one we might expect. We test our method on the New York Times Annotated Corpus and on an industrial data set from Electricit{\'e} de France (EDF) and we observe that it raises alerts at the right time compared to other techniques from the literature.},

Unfortunately, these fake recommendations can be fabricated by individual spammers or results of a manipulation campaign. Considering its severe harmfulness in influencing a product's reputation, grouped spam is more urgent to detect than individual fraud. Most state-of-the-art techniques of labeling grouped spam, e.g., Frequent Itemset Mining (FIM) or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are completely unsupervised and incapable of making good use of officially recommended topics, such as appearance, speed and standby are three suggested aspects along a cell phone product in JD.com.

Since people perform the activities differently, to avoid overfitting, building a general model with activity data of various users is required before the deployment for personal use. However, annotating a large amount of activity data is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we build a general model for activity recognition with a limited amount of labelled data. We combine Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and AdaBoost to jointly train a general activity model with partially labelled data. After that, when AdaBoost is used for online prediction, we combine it with graphical models (such as HMM and CRF) to exploit the temporal information in human activities to smooth out the accidental misclassifications. Experiments with publicly available datasets show that we are able to obtain the accuracy of more than 90% with 1% labelled data.},

To help decision-makers establish action plans based on blockchain, it is an urgent task to analyze trends in blockchain technology. However, most of existing studies on blockchain trend analysis are based on effort demanding full-text investigation or traditional bibliometric methods whose study scope is limited to a frequency-based statistical analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new topic modeling method called Word2vec-based Latent Semantic Analysis (W2V-LSA), which is based on Word2vec and Spherical k-means clustering to better capture and represent the context of a corpus. We then used W2V-LSA to perform an annual trend analysis of blockchain research by country and time for 231 abstracts of blockchain-related papers published over the past five years. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to Probabilistic LSA, one of the common topic modeling techniques. The experimental results confirmed the usefulness of W2V-LSA in terms of the accuracy and diversity of topics by quantitative and qualitative evaluation. The proposed method can be a competitive alternative for better topic modeling to provide direction for future research in technology trend analysis and it is applicable to various expert systems related to text mining.},

	abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has gained a rising concentration recently. It aims to provide a set of aspect terms and sentiments from a piece of text. Educational Data Mining (EDM) is now an essential tool for analysing pedagogical data. In academic institutions, student feedback is an influential gauge to measure the quality of the teaching--learning process. It helps higher education institutions to reconsider and improve their policies for student recruitment and retention. This paper proposed a situation awareness multi-layer topic modelling and enhanced hybrid machine learning approach for evaluating students' textual feedback data in academic institutions. The proposed Aspect2Labels (A2L) approach is divided our system into three layers. To preserve semantic information, we extracted general aspects terms in the first layer known as high-level aspects. We pulled low-level aspects terms associated with high-level aspect terms in the second layer and the third layer used for sentiment orientation. We used zero-shot learning, LDA, and different variants of LDA for the aspect extraction process. We performed annotation on unlabelled students' comments using our proposed A2L approach, and we obtained 91.3% accuracy in this process. We developed and tested novel algorithms for aspect terms mapping to label each aspect term to corresponding feedback. Different machine learning algorithms have been used to classify sentiments according to extracted aspects. We have also proposed and used Variable Global Feature Selection Scheme (VGFSS) and Variable Stopwords Filtering (VSF) to improve the performance of classifiers. We have managed to get 97% and 93% accuracy on the test dataset using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), respectively. We highly suggest that our novel approach of aspect-oriented sentiment analysis could provide adequate understanding to analyse students' feedback.},

	abstract = {Electronic commerce has become a popular shopping mode. To enhance their reputations, attract more customers, and finally obtain more benefits, dishonest sellers often recruit buyers or robots to post a large number of deceptive reviews to mislead users. According to the interpretability of learning results, existing methods for detecting deceptive reviews can be mainly divided into explicit feature-based mining ones and neural network-based implicit feature mining ones. The nature of these works is accurate text classification based on coarse-grained features (e.g., topic, sentence, and document) or fine-grained features (e.g., word). To take full merits of existing approaches, this paper proposes a new framework that explores a method to combine the coarse-grained features and the fine-grained features. In this framework, the coarse-grained implicit semantic features of the topic distribution are learned by the concatenation of a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model and a 2-layered neural network. The fine-grained implicit semantic features from the word vectors representation of the reviews are parallelly learned by a deep learning framework. Finally, these two granular features are combined and adopted to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for detecting whether a review is deceptive or not. To verify the effectiveness and performance of this framework, we derive three models by specifying three popular deep learning models, such as TextCNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and Bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) to learn the fine-grained features. Experimental results on a mixed-domain dataset and balanced/unbalanced in-domain datasets show that all the combination models are superior to the corresponding baseline models considering single features.},

	abstract = {Topic models can provide us with an insight into the underlying latent structure of a large corpus of documents. A range of methods have been proposed in the literature, including probabilistic topic models and techniques based on matrix factorization. However, in both cases, standard implementations rely on stochastic elements in their initialization phase, which can potentially lead to different results being generated on the same corpus when using the same parameter values. This corresponds to the concept of ``instability'' which has previously been studied in the context of k-means clustering. In many applications of topic modeling, this problem of instability is not considered and topic models are treated as being definitive, even though the results may change considerably if the initialization process is altered. In this paper we demonstrate the inherent instability of popular topic modeling approaches, using a number of new measures to assess stability. To address this issue in the context of matrix factorization for topic modeling, we propose the use of ensemble learning strategies. Based on experiments performed on annotated text corpora, we show that a K-Fold ensemble strategy, combining both ensembles and structured initialization, can significantly reduce instability, while simultaneously yielding more accurate topic models.},

	abstract = {We examine the long-term relationship between signals derived from nine years of unstructured social media microblog text data and financial market developments in five major economic regions. Employing statistical language modeling techniques we construct directional sentiment metrics and link these to aggregate stock index returns. To address the noise in finance-related Twitter messages we identify expert users whose tweets predominantly focus on finance topics. We document that expert users are the main drivers behind an interdependence between Twitter sentiment and financial markets. The direct prediction value of expert sentiment metrics for stock index returns, however, is found to be elusive and short-lived. Yet, we detect significant predictive gains over benchmark models in times of negative market returns. In consequence, the relation between expert sentiment metrics and stock indices is sufficient to devise hypothetically profitable cross-sectional as well as time series momentum investment strategies for futures based on Twitter signals that survive basic transaction cost assumptions. In this context, our results show that expert sentiment signals can yield higher risk-adjusted returns than classical price-based signals.},

	abstract = {Given the exponential growth of patent documents, automatic patent summarization methods to facilitate the patent analysis process are in strong demand. Recently, the development of natural language processing (NLP), text-mining, and deep learning has greatly improved the performance of text summarization models for general documents. However, existing models cannot be successfully applied to patent documents, because patent documents describing an inventive technology and using domain-specific words have many differences from general documents. To address this challenge, we propose in this study a multi-patent summarization approach based on deep learning to generate an abstractive summarization considering the characteristics of a patent. Single patent summarization and multi-patent summarization were performed through a patent-specific feature extraction process, a summarization model based on generative adversarial network (GAN), and an inference process using topic modeling. The proposed model was verified by applying it to a patent in the drone technology field. In consequence, the proposed model performed better than existing deep learning summarization models. The proposed approach enables high-quality information summary for a large number of patent documents, which can be used by R&D researchers and decision-makers. In addition, it can provide a guideline for deep learning research using patent data.},

	abstract = {Popular social media networks provide the perfect environment to study the opinions and attitudes expressed by users. While interactions in social media such as Twitter occur in many natural languages, research on stance detection (the position or attitude expressed with respect to a specific topic) within the Natural Language Processing field has largely been done for English. Although some efforts have recently been made to develop annotated data in other languages, there is a telling lack of resources to facilitate multilingual and crosslingual research on stance detection. This is partially due to the fact that manually annotating a corpus of social media texts is a difficult, slow and costly process. Furthermore, as stance is a highly domain- and topic-specific phenomenon, the need for annotated data is specially demanding. As a result, most of the manually labeled resources are hindered by their relatively small size and skewed class distribution. This paper presents a method to obtain multilingual datasets for stance detection in Twitter. Instead of manually annotating on a per tweet basis, we leverage user-based information to semi-automatically label large amounts of tweets. Empirical monolingual and cross-lingual experimentation and qualitative analysis show that our method helps to overcome the aforementioned difficulties to build large, balanced and multilingual labeled corpora. We believe that our method can be easily adapted to easily generate labeled social media data for other Natural Language Processing tasks and domains.},

Automatic generation of FAQs from email systems helps in identifying important information and could serve potential applications such as chatbots and intelligent email answering. While there exist studies in the literature focusing on automatic FAQ generation and automated email answering, there are few studies that apply recently developed deep learning techniques to fetch FAQs from emails. This paper proposes a novel framework named F-Gen, which is an expert system that generates potential FAQs from emails utilizing state-of-the-art methodologies. The key characteristics of this study are as follows: 1. Designing F-Gen with various subsystems that interoperate together for the FAQ generation 2. Identifying the parameters that determine a valid FAQ. The three subsystems of F-Gen are: (a) query classifier subsystem (QC subsystem) for email texts, (b) FAQ group generator subsystem (FGG subsystem) for generating FAQ groups from email queries. And (c) FAQ generator subsystem (FG subsystem) for conversion of email query clusters into FAQs. Experiments on the email dataset that practically reflect the above-mentioned problem resulted in FAQs with a ROUGE-1 F-Score of 74.10% when compared with the ground truth.},

	abstract = {Traditional topic modeling has been widely studied and popularly employed in expert systems and information systems. However, traditional topic models cannot discover structural relations among topics, thus losing the chance to explore the data more deeply. Hierarchical topic modeling has the capability of learning topics, as well as discovering the hierarchical topic structure from text data. But purely unsupervised models tend to generate weak topic hierarchies. To solve this problem, we propose a novel knowledge-based hierarchical topic model (KHTM), which can incorporate prior knowledge into topic hierarchy building. A key novelty of this model is that it can mine prior knowledge automatically from the topic hierarchies of multiple domains corpora. In this paper, the knowledge is represented as the word pairs which satisfy the requirement of frequent co-occurrence, and knowledge is organized in form of hierarchical structure. We also propose an iterative learning algorithm. For evaluation, we crawled two new multi-domain datasets and conducted comprehensive experiments. The experimental results show that our algorithm and model can generate more coherent topics, and more reasonable hierarchical structure.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose Ranksum, an approach for extractive text summarization of single documents based on the rank fusion of four multi-dimensional sentence features extracted for each sentence: topic information, semantic content, significant keywords, and position. The Ranksum obtains the sentence saliency rankings corresponding to each feature in an unsupervised way followed by the weighted fusion of the four scores to rank the sentences according to their significance. The scores are generated in completely unsupervised way, and a labeled document set is required to learn the fusion weights. Since we found that the fusion weights can generalize to other datasets, we consider the Ranksum as an unsupervised approach. To determine topic rank, we employ probabilistic topic models whereas semantic information is captured using sentence embeddings. To derive rankings using sentence embeddings, we utilize Siamese networks to produce abstractive sentence representation and then we formulate a novel strategy to arrange them in their order of importance. A graph-based strategy is applied to find the significant keywords and related sentence rankings in the document. We also formulate a sentence novelty measure based on bigrams, trigrams, and sentence embeddings to eliminate redundant sentences from the summary. The ranks of all the sentences -- computed for each feature -- are finally fused to get the final score for each sentence in the document. We evaluate our approach on publicly available summarization datasets --- CNN/DailyMail and DUC 2002. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms other existing state-of-the-art summarization methods.},

To help researchers clarify the changes of mental models in various innovation situations, an exploration of its topic dynamic evolution changes is urgently needed. However, most existing works have discussed the topic-semantic distributions of collected documents along the overall timeline, which ignores the semantic details of fusion and evolution between topics in continuous time. This paper discovers and reveals the multi-level information evolving of topics, by integrating latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and Word2vec harmoniously to generate the topic evolution maps of the corpus from global to local perspectives. Which include topic distribution trends and their dynamic evolution under the overall time series, as well as the merging and splitting of semantic information between topics in the adjacent time span. These reveal the correlation between topics and the full life cycle of a topic emerging, developing, maturing, and fading. Then, the integrated method was used to perform an analysis of topic evolution with 3984 abstracts of mental model-related papers published between 1980 and 2020. Finally, the performance of the proposed method was compared to that of three traditional topic evolution generated methods based on the standard evaluation metrics. The experimental results demonstrated that our method outperforms other methods both in terms of the content and strength of topic evolution. The proposed method could mine the latent evolution information more clearly and comprehensively from a vast number of papers and is also suited to the various applications of expert systems related to information mining works.},

Each DT addresses different dimensions of culture and purchasing power and the way these dimensions are associated with the topics discussed in eWOM, thus revealing patterns relating tourists' experiences with potential explanations for their dissatisfaction/satisfaction. The method is implemented in a case study in the context of tourism in Cyprus focusing on two hotel groups (2/3 and 4/5 stars) to account for their differences. Patterns emerged from the extraction of rules from DTs illuminate combinations of variables associated with tourist experience (negative or positive) for each of the two hotel categories and verify the asymmetric relationship between service performance and satisfaction. The approach can be used by management during marketing campaigns to design messages to better address the desires and needs of tourists from different cultural and economic backgrounds, as these emerge from the data analysis.},

State-of-the-art LSTM classifier require a large number of training examples to avoid biases and successfully generalise.

Labelling is a complex task that can be expensive, time-consuming, and potentially introduces biases. Data augmentation methods create synthetic data based on existing labelled examples, with the goal of improving classification results. These methods have been successfully used in image classification tasks and recent research has extended them to text classification. We propose a method that uses sentence permutations to augment an initial dataset, while retaining key statistical properties of the dataset. We evaluate our method with eight different datasets and a baseline Deep Learning process. This permutation method significantly improves classification accuracy by an average of 4.1%. We also propose two more text augmentations that reverse the classification of each augmented example, antonym and negation. We test these two augmentations in three eligible datasets, and the results suggest an -averaged, across all datasets-improvement in classification accuracy of 0.35% for antonym and 0.4% for negation, when compared to our proposed permutation augmentation.},

In order to detect deceptive reviews and mine the topics and sentiments from the reviews, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised topic-sentiment joint probabilistic model (UTSJ) based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. This model first employs Gibbs sampling algorithm to approximate parameters of maximum likelihood function offline and obtain topic-sentiment joint probabilistic distribution vector for each review. Secondly, a Random Forest classifier and a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier are trained offline, respectively. Experimental results on real-life datasets show that our proposed model is better than baseline models such as n-grams, character n-grams in token, POS (part-of-speech), LDA, and JST (Joint Sentiment/Topic). Moreover, our UTSJ model outperforms or performs similarly to benchmark models in detecting deceptive reviews over balanced dataset and unbalanced dataset in different domains. Particularly, our UTSJ model is good at dealing with real-life unbalanced big data, which makes it very suitable for being applied in e-commerce environment.},

	abstract = {Supervised text classification methods are efficient when they can learn with reasonably sized labeled sets. On the other hand, when only a small set of labeled documents is available, semi-supervised methods become more appropriate. These methods are based on comparing distributions between labeled and unlabeled instances, therefore it is important to focus on the representation and its discrimination abilities. In this paper we present the ST LDA method for text classification in a semi-supervised manner with representations based on topic models. The proposed method comprises a semi-supervised text classification algorithm based on self-training and a model, which determines parameter settings for any new document collection. Self-training is used to enlarge the small initial labeled set with the help of information from unlabeled data. We investigate how topic-based representation affects prediction accuracy by performing NBMN and SVM classification algorithms on an enlarged labeled set and then compare the results with the same method on a typical TF-IDF representation. We also compare ST LDA with supervised classification methods and other well-known semi-supervised methods. Experiments were conducted on 11 very small initial labeled sets sampled from six publicly available document collections. The results show that our ST LDA method, when used in combination with NBMN, performed significantly better in terms of classification accuracy than other comparable methods and variations. In this manner, the ST LDA method proved to be a competitive classification method for different text collections when only a small set of labeled instances is available. As such, the proposed ST LDA method may well help to improve text classification tasks, which are essential in many advanced expert and intelligent systems, especially in the case of a scarcity of labeled texts.},

	abstract = {The systematic literature review (SLR) process includes several steps to collect secondary data and analyze it to answer research questions. In this context, the document retrieval and primary study selection steps are heavily intertwined and known for their repetitiveness, high human workload, and difficulty identifying all relevant literature. This study aims to reduce human workload and error of the document retrieval and primary study selection processes using a decision support system (DSS). An open-source DSS is proposed that supports the document retrieval step, dataset preprocessing, and citation classification. The DSS is domain-independent, as it has proven to carefully select an article's relevance based solely on the title and abstract. These features can be consistently retrieved from scientific database APIs. Additionally, the DSS is designed to run in the cloud without any required programming knowledge for reviewers. A Multi-Channel CNN architecture is implemented to support the citation screening process. With the provided DSS, reviewers can fill in their search strategy and manually label only a subset of the citations. The remaining unlabeled citations are automatically classified and sorted based on probability. It was shown that for four out of five review datasets, the DSS's use achieved significant workload savings of at least 10%. The cross-validation results show that the system provides consistent results up to 88.3% of work saved during citation screening. In two cases, our model yielded a better performance over the benchmark review datasets. As such, the proposed approach can assist the development of systematic literature reviews independent of the domain. The proposed DSS is effective and can substantially decrease the document retrieval and citation screening steps' workload and error rate.},

	abstract = {In the past, most historical research has been manually carried out by exploring historical facts reading between the lines of documents. Nowadays, historical big data has become electronically available and advances in machine learning techniques allow us to analyze the vast amount of historical data. From a historical perspective, making inferences about political stances of historical figures is important for grasping historical rivalries and power structures of an era. Thus, in this paper, we propose an approach to the systematic inference of power mechanisms based on a human network constructed from historical data. In this network, humans are linked according to the degree of kinship using genealogy records, and identified by political stances on agendas recorded in the annals of a dynasty as a political force. And then, a machine learning algorithm, semi-supervised learning, classifies humans who cannot identify political stances as political forces that reflect the links of the networks. The data consist of the genealogy of the Andong Gwon clan, a record of family relations of 10,243 people from the 10th to 15th century Korea, and the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, a historical volume that describes historical facts of the Joseon Dynasty for 472 years and is composed of 1894 fascicles and 888 books. From the data, we construct a human network based on a historically meaningful period (1443--1488), and classify people into two political forces using the proposed method. We suggest that this machine learning approach to historical study could be utilized as a potent reference tool devoid of the subjectivism of human experts in the field of history.},

In particular, we demonstrate the extraction of multimodal representation models of movies, based on textual information from subtitles, as well as cues from the audio and visual channels. With regards to the textual domain, we emphasize our research in topic modeling of movies based on their subtitles, in order to extract topics that discriminate between movies. Regarding the visual domain, we focus on the extraction of semantically useful features that model camera movements, colors and faces, while for the audio domain we adopt simple classification aggregates based on pretrained models. The three domains are combined with static metadata (e.g. directors, actors) to prove that the content-based movie similarity procedure can be enhanced with low-level multimodal information. In order to demonstrate the proposed content representation approach, we have built a small dataset of 160 widely known movies. We assert movie similarities, as propagated by the individual modalities and fusion models, in the form of recommendation rankings. Extensive experimentation proves that all three low-level modalities (text, audio and visual) boost the performance of a content-based recommendation system, compared to the typical metadata-based content representation, by more than 50% relative increase. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that utilizes a wide range of features from all involved modalities, in order to enhance the performance of the content similarity estimation, compared to the metadata-based approaches.},

	abstract = {Learning the low-dimensional vector representation of networks can effectively reduce the complexity of various network analysis tasks, such as link prediction, clustering and classification. However, most of the existing network representation learning (NRL) methods are aimed at homogeneous or static networks, while the real-world networks are usually heterogeneous and tend to change dynamically over time, therefore providing an intelligent insight into the evolution of heterogeneous networks is more practical and significant. Based on this consideration, we focus on the dynamic representation learning problem for heterogeneous information networks, and propose a random walk based Dynamic Representation Learning method for Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN_DRL), which can learn the representation of network nodes at different timestamps. Specifically, we improve the first step of the existing random walk based NRL methods, which generally include two steps: constructing node sequences through random walk process, and then learning node representations by throwing the node sequences into a homogeneous or heterogeneous Skip-Gram model. In order to construct optimized node sequences for evolving heterogeneous networks, we propose a method for automatically extracting and extending meta-paths, and propose a new method for generating node sequences via dynamic random walk based on meta-path and timestamp information of networks. We also propose two strategies for adjusting the quantity and length of node sequences during each random walk process, which makes it more effective to construct the node sequences for heterogeneous information networks at a specific timestamp, thus improving the effect of dynamic representation learning. Extensive experimental results show that compared with the state-of-art algorithms, HIN_DRL achieves better results in Macro-F1, Micro-F1 and NMI for multi-label node classification, multi-class node classification and node clustering on several real-world network datasets. Furthermore, case studies of visualization and dynamic on Microsoft Academic dataset demonstrate that HIN_DRL can learn network representation dynamically and more effectively.},

In this study, we propose Topic2labels (T2L) framework which provides an automated way of labeling the data through LDA (latent dirichlet allocation) topic modeling approach and utilize Bert (the bidirectional encoder representation from transformer) embeddings for construction of feature vector to be employed to classify the data contextually. Our framework consists of three layers. In the first layer, we adopt LDA to generate the topics from the data, and develop a new algorithm to rank the topics, and map the highest ranked dominant topic into label to annotate the data. In the second layer, we transform the labeled text into feature representation through Bert embeddings and in the third layer we leveraged deep learning models as classifiers to classify the textual data into multiple categories. Experimental results on crisis-related datasets show that our framework performs better in terms of classification performance and yields improvement as compared to other baseline approaches.},

The present paper proposes two translation methods for extracting more relevant translations. The proposed methods rely on the attention mechanism. The methods use multi-label classifiers that take each question as input and predict the skills related to the question. Using the attention mechanism, the model is able to focus on specific parts of the given input and predict the correct labels. The ultimate goal of these networks is to predict skills related to questions. Using word attention scores, we can find out how relevant a single word is to a particular skill. As a result of these attention scores, we obtain more relevant translations for each skill. We then use these translations to bridge the lexical gap and improve expert retrieval results. Extensive experiments on two large sub-collections of the StackOverflow dataset demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the best baseline method by up to 14.11/% MAP improvement.},

Although this serves as vital source information for enhancing rating prediction performance, few studies have attempted to fully utilize it for better accuracy of recommendation systems. Most of these studies typically assign equal weights to all aspects in the opinion mining process, however, in practices; users tend to give different priority on different aspects of the product when reaching overall ratings. In addition, most of the existing methods typically rely on handcrafted, rule-based or double propagation methods in the opinion mining process which are known to be time-consuming and often inclined to errors. This could affect the reliability and performance of the recommender systems (RS). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a weighted Aspect-based Opinion mining using Deep learning method for Recommender system (AODR) that can extract product's aspects and the underlying weighted user opinions from the review text using a deep learning method and then fuse them into extended collaborative filtering (CF) technique for improving the RS. The proposed method is basically comprised of two components: (1) Aspect-based opinion mining module which aims to extract the product aspects from the review text to generate aspect rating matrix. (2) Recommendation generation component that uses tensor factorization (TF) technique to compute weighted aspect ratings and finally infer the overall rating prediction. We evaluate the proposed model in terms of both aspect extraction and recommendation performance.

To combat this phenomenon, several classification methods have been developed to train automated tools in the arduous task of distinguishing between genuine and misleading reviews, the most recent based on machine and deep learning techniques. This paper proposes a multi-label classification methodology based on the Google BERT neural language model to build a deceptive review detector aided by its sentiment awareness: improved modeling of the link between sentiment polarity and deceptiveness during the fine-tuning phase by exploiting the Binary Cross Entropy with Logits loss function adds to the advantages provided by pre-trained contextual models, which are able to capture word polysemy through word embeddings and benefit from pre-training on huge corpora.

However, a sentiment word may express different sentiment orientations describing different targets. It's beneficial but challenging to incorporate knowledge of opinion targets into sentiment lexicon. In this paper we propose an automatic approach to construct a target-specific sentiment lexicon, in which each term is an opinion pair consisting of an opinion target and an opinion word. The approach solves two principle problems in construction process, namely, opinion target extraction and opinion pair sentiment classification. An unsupervised algorithm is proposed to extract opinion pairs in high quality. Both semantic feature and syntactic feature are incorporated in the algorithm, to extract opinion pairs containing correct opinion targets. A group of opinion pairs are generated and a framework is proposed to classify their sentiment polarities. Knowledge of available resources including general-purpose sentiment lexicon and thesaurus, and context knowledge including syntactic relations and sentiment information in sentences, are extracted and integrated in a unified framework to calculate sentiment scores of opinion pairs. Experimental results on product reviews datasets in different domains prove the effectiveness of our method in target-specific sentiment lexicon construction, which can improve performances of opinion target extraction and opinion pair sentiment classification. In addition, our lexicon also achieves better performance in target-level sentiment classification compared with several general-purpose sentiment lexicons.},

	abstract = {The recent pandemic has changed the way we see education. During recent years, Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) providers, such as Coursera or edX, are reporting millions of new users signing up on their platforms. Though online review systems are standard among many verticals, no standardized or fully decentralized review systems exist in the MOOC ecosystem. In this vein, we believe that there is an opportunity to leverage available open MOOC reviews in order to build simpler and more transparent reviewing systems, allowing users to really identify the best courses out there. Specifically, in our research we analyze 2.4 million reviews (which is the largest MOOC reviews dataset used until now) from five different platforms in order to determine the following: (1) if the numeric ratings provide discriminant information to learners, (2) if NLP-driven sentiment analysis on textual reviews could provide valuable information to learners, (3) if we can leverage NLP-driven topic finding techniques to infer themes that could be important for learners, and (4) if we can use these models to effectively characterize MOOCs based on the open reviews. Results show that numeric ratings are clearly biased (63% of them are 5-star ratings), and the topic modeling reveals some interesting topics related with course advertisements, the real applicability, or the difficulty of the different courses.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, due to the rapid growth of digital technologies, huge volumes of image data are created and shared on social media sites. User-provided tags attached to each social image are widely recognized as a bridge to fill the semantic gap between low-level image features and high-level concepts. Hence, a combination of images along with their corresponding tags is useful for intelligent retrieval systems, those are designed to gain high-level understanding from images and facilitate semantic search. However, user-provided tags in practice are usually incomplete and noisy, which may degrade the retrieval performance. To tackle this problem, we present a novel retrieval framework that automatically associates the visual content with textual tags and enables effective image search. To this end, we first propose a probabilistic topic model learned on social images to discover latent topics from the co-occurrence of tags and image features. Moreover, our topic model is built by exploiting the expert knowledge about the correlation between tags with visual contents and the relationship among image features that is formulated in terms of spatial location and color distribution. The discovered topics then help to predict missing tags of an unseen image as well as the ones partially labeled in the database. These predicted tags can greatly facilitate the reliable measure of semantic similarity between the query and database images. Therefore, we further present a scoring scheme to estimate the similarity by fusing textual tags and visual representation. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets show that our topic model provides the accurate annotation against the noise and incompleteness of tags. Using our generalized scoring scheme, which is particularly advantageous to many types of queries, the proposed approach also outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of retrieval accuracy.},

	abstract = {In this work, we cope with the classification of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in Spanish according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). We employ Topic Models representing each document as a probabilistic distribution over topics, offering a low-dimensional representation of documents. The trend is to turn to an embedding text representation, but these approaches require large amounts of textual data. We found Topic Models as a suitable alternative approach to deal with the few resources available for Spanish clinical text mining. Besides, they are interpretable and aid the explainability in artificial intelligence (XAI). We explored two different methods, known as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Partially Labelled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (PLDA), the supervised approach of the former. We assessed the results attained in Spanish with an analogous task in English as a reference. Evaluation methods were applied directly to the representation, with metrics to determine topic coherence and the relationship between topics and ICD labels. We learned that PLDA was able to discover topics associated with the ICD. This finding means that this representation itself can reveal ICD codes previous to classification. Also, this representation was used as predictive features to feed a conventional classifier to show their competence in a downstream task. We conclude that in a context with a lack of big data availability, PLDA emerges as a versatile candidate, able to offer a competitive representation of EHRs. While other works are primarily concerned with supervised categorization and do not pay attention to the representation, LDA and PLDA offer an interpretable approach that can be associated with ICDs. Moreover, compared with those that employ LDA, we demonstrate how its' supervised version, PLDA, can be more intuitive as it shows a closer relation with the ICDs.},

But, the internaut can't remember all such emails. Even though email thread identification approaches give satisfactory benefits to the internauts, but they may fail to alert them for a cause to identify the sentiments behind an email thread. To address, this issue Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis clustering algorithm has been used in this paper to identify the email sentiment thread sequence. The sentiment and the thread sequence within the emails have been discovered as clustering sentiment polarity and temporal categories with the help of PLSA clusters. At the initial stage, we used three feature extraction methods, latent semantic analysis (LDA), bag of words (BoW), TF-IDF and SentiWordNet (SWN) lexicon for generating sentiment features of email. Next, Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis algorithm is used to form email clusters based on sentiment features. Thus, it helps to identify thread sentiment and sequence of sentiment threads. Email threads give a mechanism by which any user will be able to find out the sequence in the thread on the basis of sentiment analysis of email related to a specific set of communication during a specific time period. Various parameters evaluation measures have been considered in this work to evaluate the proposed model such as accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure, and the proposed algorithm is compared with other standard algorithms. Furthermore, a statistical test has also been performed.},

Music tracks are more accurately represented by aggregating the latent factors derived from both the tag space and the user interaction information. The proposed framework further employs a Gaussian state-space model to capture the evolving nature of users' preferences over time, which helps achieve time-sensitive recommendation of music. A variational approximation is developed to achieve fast inference and learning of model parameters.

Detecting these crisis events helps watchers to make right decisions rapidly, reducing injuries, deaths and economic loss. In sporting activities, detecting events helps audiences make better and more timely game viewing plans. However, existing event detection techniques are not effective at handling complex social events that evolve over time. In this paper, we propose an event detection method that takes advantage of retweeting behavior for handling the events evolution. Specifically, we first propose a topic model called RL-LDA to capture the social media information over hashtag, location, textual and retweeting behavior. Using RL-LDA, a complex event can be well handled by exploring the correlation between retweeting behavior and the event. Then to maintain the RL-LDA in a dynamic environment, we propose a dynamic update algorithm, which incrementally updates events over real time streams. Experiments over real-world datasets show that RL-LDA detects the temporal evolution of complex events effectively and efficiently.},

The clustering method is based on the Gaussian probability density distribution combined with a Takagi--Sugeno fuzzy consequent part of order zero (eGauss0). This means that this method can be used as a classifier that is actually a mapping from the feature space to the class label space. The eGauss method is very flexible, is computed recursively, and the most important thing is that it starts learning ``from scratch''. The structure adapts to the new data using adding and merging mechanisms. The most important feature of the evolving method is that it can process data from thousands of Twitter profiles in real time, which can be characterized as a Big Data problem. The final clusters yield classes of Twitter profiles, which are represented as different activity levels of each profile. In this way, we could classify each member as ordinary, very active, influential and unusual user. The proposed method was also tested on the Iris and Breast Cancer Wisconsin datasets and compared with other methods. In both cases, the proposed method achieves high classification rates and shows competitive results.},

	abstract = {The quality of any text mining technique is highly dependent on the features that are used to represent the document collection. A classical form of document representation is the vector space model (VSM), according to which the documents are represented as vectors of weights that correspond to the features of the documents. The bag-of-words model is the most popular VSM approach due to its simplicity and general applicability, but this model does not include term dependency and has a high dimensionality. In the literature, several models for document representation have been proposed in order to capture the dependency of terms. Among them, the topic model representation is one of the most interesting approaches - since it describes the collection of documents in a way that reveals their internal structure and the interrelationships therein, and also provides a dimensionality reduction. However, even for topic models, the efficient extraction of information concerning the relations among terms for document representation is still a major research challenge. In order to address this issue, we proposed thelatent association rule cluster based model (LARCM). The LARCM is a non-probabilistic topic model that makes use of association rule clustering to build a document representation with low dimensionality in such a way that each feature (i.e., topic) is comprised of information concerning relations among the terms. We evaluated the interpretability of the topics obtained by using our proposed model against the ones provided by the traditional latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) model and the LDA model using a document representation that includes correlated terms (i.e., bag-of-related-words). The experimental results indicated that the LARCM provides topics with better interpretability than the LDA models. Additionally, we used the topics obtained by the LARCM in two different applications: text classification and page recommendation. With respect to text classification, the topics were used to improve document collection representation. Concerning page recommendation, topics were used as contextual information in context-aware recommender systems. Results have shown that the topics provided by the LARCM can be used to improve both applications.},

Of particular interest is to capture users' preferences for various items by using textual reviews to achieve accurate and interpretable recommendations. In this paper, we report an aspect-aware explainable neural attentional recommender model for rating predication (AENAR) and this model enables intelligent predication and recommendation by capturing the varying aspect attentions that users pay to different items. The experimental results based on six public datasets reveals that the designed model consistently outperforms five existing state-of-the-art alternatives. Furthermore, the designed attention network allows to highlight the context-aware information in textual reviews that unambiguously suggest users' aspect-level preference for their desired items, improving the interpretability of the rating prediction.},

	abstract = {There is a rising need for automated analysis of news text, and topic models have proven to be useful tools for this task. However, as the quality of the topics induced by topic models greatly varies, much research effort has been devoted to their automated evaluation. Recent research has focused on topic coherence as a measure of a topic's quality. Existing topic coherence measures work by considering the semantic similarity of topic words. This makes them unfit to detect the coherence of transient topics with semantically unrelated topic words, which abound in news media texts. In this paper, we introduce the notion of document-based topic coherence and propose novel topic coherence measures that estimate topic coherence based on topic documents rather than topic words. We evaluate the proposed measures on two datasets containing topics manually labeled for document-based coherence, on which the proposed measures outperform a strong baseline as well as word-based coherence measures. We also demonstrate the usefulness of document-based coherence measures for automated topic discovery from news media texts.},

However, current solutions for land-use discovery based on user-generated data usually rely on an information retrieval mechanism applied on a textual corpus. This causes ad-hoc place labelling with limited semantic meaning. In this line, the present work introduces a novel data-driven methodology that extends existing solutions by means of a classifier based on a pre-defined hierarchy of land categories. Two types of social networks --text-based and venue-based platforms-- are utilized to train the classifier, which is then applied to infer the use of the land based on text data in areas where venue data are not available. The approach has been evaluated by using large datasets comprising two large cities, showing an accuracy above 90% in predicting the land-use categories.},

A challenging issue in SBS development is to find suitable services from a variety of available (semantics different) services. Towards this issue, we propose a new service recommendation approach that can integrate diverse information of SBSs and their component services. In this research, SBSs, services, their respective attributes (e.g. content and categories) and SBS-service composition relations are modeled as a heterogeneous information network (HIN); and several semantic similarities between SBSs are measured on a set of meta-paths in the HIN. Particularly, a word embedding technique is used to learn word vectors from the content of SBSs and services, which contribute to better functional similarities between SBSs. Afterwards, the combinational weights of different similarities are optimized using a Bayesian personalized ranking algorithm. Services are finally recommended based on collaborative filtering. We identify two recommendation scenarios with different SBS requirements. By conducting a series of experiments on a real-world dataset crawled from the ProgrammableWeb, we validate the effectiveness of our approach and find out the optimal combinations of SBS similarities for those two scenarios.},

	abstract = {Sentiment mining has been a helpful mechanism that targets to understand the market feedback on certain commodities by utilizing user comments. In general, the process of yielding each comment is essentially associated with his/her criteria for rating (i.e., the degree of harshness) , which makes users provide biased comments. For instance, for a tolerant user, although the user is extremely dissatisfied with the product, harshness still makes her yield a neutral comment which cannot indicate the product quality. Existing work straightforwardly removes the comments of harsh users and those of tolerant ones, which is not the best strategy. To this end, we propose a harshness-aware sentiment analysis framework for product review. First, we depict the process of providing comments from users as a probabilistic graphical model in which the harshness is incorporated. Second, we employ a Bayesian-based inference for sentiment mining. Extensive experimental evaluations have shown that the results of the proposed method are more consistent with the expert evaluations than those of the state-of-the-art methods, and even outperform the method which infers the final evaluations with the ground truth of comments without considering users' harshness.},

	abstract = {Recently, the explosive increase in social media data enables manufacturers to collect product defect information promptly. Extant literature gathers defect information like defective components or defect symptoms without distinguishing defect-related (DR) texts from defect-unrelated (DUR) texts and thus makes defects discussed by few texts buried in enormous DUR texts. Moreover, existing studies do not consider the defect severity which is valuable and important for manufacturers to make remedial decisions. To bridge these research gaps, we propose a novel approach that integrates the probabilistic graphic model named Product Defect Identification and Analysis Model (PDIAM) with Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) to derive product defect information from social media data. Comparing to extant studies, PDIAM identifies DR texts and then extracts defect information from these texts. And PDIAM provides more defect information than previous researches. Besides, we further analyze defect severity with the combination of FMEA and PDIAM which alleviates the inherent subjectivity brought by expert evaluation in the traditional FMEA. A case study in the automobile industry proves the predominant performance of our approach and great potential in defect management.},

Automated service classification that groups web services by similar functionality is a widely used technique to facilitate the management and discovery of web services within a large-scale repository. The existing service classification approaches primarily focus on learning the isolated representations of service features but ignored their internal semantic correlations. To address the aforementioned issue, we propose a novel deep neural network with the Co-Attentive Representation Learning (CARL-Net) mechanism for effectively classifying services by learning interdependent characteristics of service without feature engineering. Specifically, we propose a service data augmentation mechanism by extracting informative words from the service description using information gain theory. Such a mechanism can learn a correlation matrix among embedded augmented data and description, thereby obtaining their interdependent semantic correlation representations for service classification. We evaluate the effectiveness of CARL-Net by comprehensive experiments based on a real-world dataset collected from ProgrammableWeb, which includes 10,943 web services. Compared with seven web service classification baselines based on CNN, LSTM, Recurrent-CNN, C-LSTM, BLSTM, ServeNet and ServeNet-BERT, the CARL-Net can achieve an improvement of 5.66%--172.21% in the F-measure of web service classification.},

	abstract = {Disaster event detection aims to identify events like terrorist attacks, fire incidents, stampede incidents, building collapse, etc., reported in the online news articles or social media. Place of occurrence of disaster event is a significant feature associated with events for location-sensitive disaster event detection. Efficient feature selection and their augmentation with location information can contribute towards the evolution of traditional approaches and their adoption for location-sensitive disaster event detection leading to improvement in the overall process as a whole. Since the evaluation of event detection techniques deliberates various intrinsic and extrinsic performance metrics, the decision-making for the selection of feature sets is treated as a Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. This paper proposes a framework, GeoClust, that is based on feature engineering of traditional textual features in order to enhance their capability for improved location-sensitive disaster event detection. The framework augments context-free and context-based textual feature sets with feature sets of place of occurrence of the events and evaluates their performance using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for various performance metrics. Finally, the best feature set is selected using AHP-TOPSIS technique of MCDM in order to tune the system for automatic and efficient location-sensitive disaster event detection in real-time. Extensive set of experiments have been performed in order to evaluate the framework on a dataset of online news articles reporting disaster events about terrorist attacks, fire incidents, stampede incidents, building collapse and maoist attacks happened at different locations in India. The results show that the location-augmented feature sets significantly improve performance of location-sensitive disaster event detection as compared with traditional feature sets. The results also demonstrate that the context-based feature sets with location-augmentation are ranked higher than the context-free feature sets in MCDM analysis.},

	abstract = {Boosting algorithms have been proved effective for multi-label learning. As ensemble learning algorithms, boosting algorithms build classifiers by composing a set of weak hypotheses. The high computational cost of boosting algorithms in learning from large volumes of data such as text categorization datasets is a real challenge. Most boosting algorithms, such as AdaBoost.MH, iteratively examine all training features to generate the weak hypotheses, which increases the learning time. RFBoost was introduced to manage this problem based on a rank-and-filter strategy in which it first ranks the training features and then, in each learning iteration, filters and uses only a subset of the highest-ranked features to construct the weak hypotheses. This step ensures accelerated learning time for RFBoost compared to AdaBoost.MH, as the weak hypotheses produced in each iteration are reduced to a very small number. As feature ranking is the core idea of RFBoost, this paper presents and investigates seven feature ranking methods (information gain, chi-square, GSS-coefficient, mutual information, odds ratio, F1 score, and accuracy) in order to improve RFBoost's performance. Moreover, an accelerated version of RFBoost, called RFBoost1, is also introduced. Rather than filtering a subset of the highest-ranked features, FBoost1 selects only one feature, based on its weight, to build a new weak hypothesis. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets for multi-label text categorization) Reuters-21578, 20-Newsgroups, OHSUMED, and TMC2007(demonstrate that among the methods evaluated for feature ranking, mutual information yields the best performance for RFBoost. In addition, the results prove that RFBoost statistically outperforms both RFBoost1 and AdaBoost.MH on all datasets. Finally, RFBoost1 proved more efficient than AdaBoost.MH, making it a better alternative for addressing classification problems in real-life applications and expert systems.},

	abstract = {Topic modeling is a popular unsupervised technique that is used to discover the latent thematic structure in text corpora. The evaluation of topic models typically involves measuring the semantic coherence of the terms describing each topic, where a single value is used to summarize the quality of an overall model. However, this can create difficulties when one seeks to interpret the strengths and weaknesses of a given topic model. With this in mind, we propose a new ensemble topic modeling approach that incorporates both stability information, in the form of term co-associations, and semantic similarity information, as derived from a word embedding constructed on a background corpus. Our evaluations show that this approach can simultaneously yield higher quality models when considering the produced topic descriptors and document-topic assignments, while also facilitating the comparison and evaluation of solutions through the visualization of the discovered topical structure, the ordering of the topic descriptors, and the ranking of term pairs which appear in topic descriptors.},

	abstract = {Openness to experience, one of the essential individual characteristics, is of great theoretical and practical value in psychological and behavioral domains. Although typical machine learning methods can be utilized to extract individuals' openness to experience from the large-scale textual data like the unprecedented massive user generated contents (UGCs), they are often regarded as ``black boxes'' because they are unable to provide knowledge about the influential factors of openness to experience. This is of no help for us to investigate why a particular level of openness to experience is predicted for an individual. In addition, high dimensionality and sparseness of textual data impairs the performance of the typical machine learning method in extracting individuals' characteristics. In this study, we propose an interpretable data-driven mixture method for qualified modeling and predicting individuals' openness to experience. The proposed method extends the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to overcome the problem of high dimensionality and sparseness in modeling the textual data, and can effectively extract two influential variables, namely, the topic preference and the expressed emotional intensity, to make an accurate prediction and to help us fully understand individuals' openness to experience lurking in the textual data. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method in drawing individuals' openness to experience, and also validate the predictive ability of topic preference and expressed emotional intensity which are indicated in psychological literature to be influential factors of openness to experience.},

This knowledge is employed in different applications such as recommender systems, crisis management systems, and decision support systems. Dynamicity, overlapping, and evolutionary behavior are the most important issues in event detection. This paper proposes a novel evolutionary model for event detection to capture the dynamism and evolving behavior of events. The proposed method uses a matrix decomposition technique and a Dirichlet Process to detect events and handle their dynamicity. This model consists of two components, namely preliminary event detection and event evolvement tracking. The former component extracts preliminary events from the available data using the matrix decomposition method. Then, subsequent data is employed into a Non-Parametric Bayesian Network, namely Dirichlet Process Mixture Model to evolve the preliminary events. During the evolvement process, data may migrate between extracted events or new events may be discovered. The experimental results and comparisons with several recently developed approaches show the superiority of the proposed approach, and its ability to capture the evolutionary behavior of events over time.},

	abstract = {Due to its simplicity and intuitive interpretability, spherical k-means is often used for clustering a large number of documents. However, there exist a number of drawbacks that need to be addressed for much effective document clustering. Without well-dispersed initial points, spherical k-means fails to converge quickly, which is critical for clustering a large number of documents. Furthermore, its dense centroid vectors needlessly incorporate the impact of infrequent and less-informative words, thereby distorting the distance calculation between the document vectors. In this paper, we propose practical improvements on spherical k-means to overcome these issues during document clustering. Our proposed initialization method not only guarantees dispersed initial points, but is also up to 1000 times faster than previously well-known initialization method such as k-means++. Furthermore, we enforce sparsity on the centroid vectors by using a data-driven threshold that is capable of dynamically adjusting its value depending on the clusters. Additionally, we propose an unsupervised cluster labeling method that effectively extracts meaningful keywords to describe each cluster. We have tested our improvements on seven different text datasets that include both new and publicly available datasets. Based on our experiments on these datasets, we have found that our proposed improvements successfully overcome the drawbacks of spherical k-means in significantly reduced computation time. Furthermore, we have qualitatively verified the performance of the proposed cluster labeling method by extracting descriptive keywords of the clusters from these datasets.},

	abstract = {Recently, heterogeneous network representation learning has attracted a lot of attentions due to its potential applications. Our works in this paper are concentrated on how to leverage the output of network representation learning by combining with the topic similarity between nodes in content-based heterogeneous information network (CHIN). These unique challenges come from the shortage of topic similarity evaluation between text-based nodes which limit the accuracy of the similarity search as well other network mining tasks. Moreover, the massive sizes of current real-world network also raises challenges for traditional standalone-based heterogeneous network analysis models. Different from previous network representation learning models, such as: Node2Vec or Metapath2Vec, our proposed W-MethPath2Vec model uses the topic-driven meta-path-based random walk mechanism for generating heterogeneous neighborhood of nodes as the learning features. Then, these learning nodes' features are used to train the learning model which is used for solving various heterogeneous network mining tasks such as: node similarity search, clustering, classification, link prediction, etc. The W-MethPath2Vec model enables the simultaneous modeling of structural and topic correlations between nodes in heterogeneous networks. Moreover, the W-MethPath2Vec model is implemented in the Apache Spark-based distributed framework which enables the capability of handling large-scaled networks. We tested our W-MethPath2Vec model with the previous state-of-the-art approaches in the real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.},

	abstract = {With rapid development of socio-economics, the task of discovering functional zones becomes critical to better understand the interactions between social activities and spatial locations. In this paper, we propose a framework to discover the real functional zones from the biased and extremely sparse Point of Interests (POIs). To cope with the bias and sparsity of POIs, the unbiased inner influences between spatial locations and human activities are introduced to learn a balanced and dense latent region representation. In addition, a spatial location based clustering method is also included to enrich the spatial information for latent region representation and enhance the region functionality consistency for the fine-grained region segmentation. Moreover, to properly annotate the various and fine-grained region functionalities, we estimate the functionality of the regions and rank them by the differences between the normalized POI distributions to reduce the inconsistency caused by the fine-grained segmentation. Thus, our whole framework is able to properly address the biased categories in sparse POI data and explore the true functional zones with a fine-grained level. To validate the proposed framework, a case study is evaluated by using very large real-world users GPS and POIs data from city of Raleigh. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can better identify functional zones than the benchmarks, and, therefore, enhance understanding of urban structures with a finer granularity under practical conditions.},

	abstract = {Hyper-personalization policies entail a considerable improvement regarding previous personalization approaches. However, they present several issues that need to be addressed, such as minimal explainability and privacy invasion. A hierarchical Multi-Agent System (MAS) is presented in this work to provide a solution to these concerns. The system is formulated as a hybrid approach, where some of the agents work autonomously, while the user input triggers the remaining. At the autonomous level, a set of Virtual Identities (VIs) representing different user profiles interact with Black-Box Hyper-Personalization Online Systems (BBHOS), gathering a set of targeted responses. Associative patterns and profile aggregations can then be inferred from the analysis of these responses. In the user-triggered level, the real user is virtualized as an identity that represents their features. The virtual identity serves as an intermediary between the personalization system and the real user. This virtualization hinders the personalization service from extracting sensitive contextual information about the real user, protecting their privacy. The results obtained by the user identity on its interaction with the personalization service are then analyzed, adjusting the content of the response to fit the user's requests instead of their features. A use case on the functioning of the analysis of search engines is presented to illustrate the complete behavior of the proposed architecture.},

It uses a confirmatory strategy. This study seeks to propose solutions for two limitations found in the current Inbuilt-Rubric methodology: one solution is inspired by Bifactor Models and the management of common variance of the concepts involved; and the other one is based in randomizing the sequence to perform the process.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose DeepSumm, a novel method based on topic modeling and word embeddings for the extractive summarization of single documents. Recent summarization methods based on sequence networks fail to capture the long range semantics of the document which are encapsulated in the topic vectors of the document. In DeepSumm, our aim is to utilize the latent information in the document estimated via topic vectors and sequence networks to improve the quality and accuracy of the summarized text. Each sentence is encoded through two different recurrent neural networks based on probabilistic topic distributions and word embeddings, and then a sequence to sequence network is applied to each sentence encoding. The outputs of the encoder and the decoder in the sequence to sequence networks are combined after weighting using an attention mechanism and converted into a score through a multi-layer perceptron network. We refer to the score obtained through the topic model as Sentence Topic Score (STS) and to the score generated through word embeddings as Sentence Content Score (SCS). In addition, we propose Sentence Novelty Score (SNS) and Sentence Position Score (SPS) and perform a weighted fusion of the four scores for each sentence in the document to compute a Final Sentence Score (FSS). The proposed DeepSumm framework was evaluated on the standard DUC 2002 benchmark and CNN/DailyMail datasets. Experimentally, it was demonstrated that our method captures both the global and the local semantic information of the document and essentially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for extractive text summarization with ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of 53.2, 28.7 and 49.2 on DUC 2002 and 43.3, 19.0 and 38.9 on CNN/DailyMail dataset.},

In recent years, some recommendation systems emerged to solve this problem but remain limited since they do not identify the student's prior knowledge broadly or the student's goals. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes the Fragmented Recommendation for MOOCs Ecosystems (FReME), a recommendation system to suggest parts of courses from multiple providers (i.e., Khan Academy, Udemy, and edX). FReME is based on the student profile and on the MOOCs ecosystems perspective to balance the ecological environment and strengthen interactions. Moreover, we differ from the current recommendation systems since our method identifies and reduces the students' knowledge gap optimizing the learning process. Experimental results conducted with a dataset integrating 3 MOOCs providers and 19 students demonstrated that the implemented techniques are more consistent than other approaches. Finally, it was verified through precision, utility, novelty, and confidence that our recommendations are 62,24% accurate, 68.89% useful, 72.81% reliable, and present new content in 99.12% of cases. These results validate that FReME supports students in reducing their knowledge gap.},

	abstract = {A patent gives the owner of an invention the exclusive rights to make, use and sell their invention. Before a new patent application is filed, patent lawyers are required to engage in Prior Art Search to determine the likelihood that an invention is novel, valid or to make sense of the domain. To perform this search, existing platforms utilize keywords and Boolean Logic, which disregards the syntax and semantics of natural language and thus, making the search extremely difficult. Consequently, studies regarding semantics using neural embeddings exist, but these only consider a narrow number of unidirectional words. In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework to consider bidirectional semantics, syntax and the thematic nature of natural language for prior art search. The proposed framework goes beyond keywords as input queries and takes a patent as the input. The contributions of this paper is twofold; adapting pre-trained embedding models (e.g., BERT) to address the semantics and syntax of language, followed by the second component, which exploits topic modeling to build a diversified answer that covers all themes across domains of the input patent. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on the CLEF-IP 2011 benchmark dataset and a real-world dataset obtained from Google patent repository and show that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods and returns meaningful results for a given patent.},

Detecting people's concerns and attention from online social media platforms has been widely acknowledged as an effective approach to relieve public panic and prevent a social crisis. However, detecting concerns in time from massive volumes of information in social media turns out to be a big challenge, especially when sufficient manually labelled data is in the absence during public health emergencies, e.g., COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model to identify people's concerns and the corresponding relations based on Graph Convolutional Networks and Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory integrated with Concern Graphs. Except for the sequential features from BERT embeddings, the regional features of tweets can be extracted by the Concern Graph module, which not only benefits the concern detection but also enables our model to be high noise-tolerant. Thus, our model can address the issue of insufficient manually labelled data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model by using both manually labelled tweets and automatically labelled tweets. The experimental results show that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art models on real-world datasets.},

	abstract = {Aspect extraction is one of the fundamental steps in analyzing the characteristics of opinions, feelings and emotions expressed in textual data provided for a certain topic. Current aspect extraction techniques are mostly based on topic models; however, employing only topic models causes incoherent aspects to be generated. Therefore, this paper aims to discover more precise aspects by incorporating co-occurrence relations as prior domain knowledge into the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model. In the proposed method, first, the preliminary aspects are generated based on LDA. Then, in an iterative manner, the prior knowledge is extracted automatically from co-occurrence relations and similar aspects of relevant topics. Finally, the extracted knowledge is incorporated into the LDA model. The iterations improve the quality of the extracted aspects. The competence of the proposed ELDA for the aspect extraction task is evaluated through experiments on two datasets in the English and Persian languages. The experimental results indicate that ELDA not only outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of topic coherence and precision, but also has no particular dependency on the written language and can be applied to all languages with reasonable accuracy. Thus, ELDA can impact natural language processing applications, particularly in languages with limited linguistic resources.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the importance of social media, a Social Network Opinion Leaders (SNOL) system has been proposed in this paper. The purpose of this system is to identify topic-based opinion leaders of social media. In order to accomplish this goal, several steps have been taken, such as data collection, data processing, data analysis, data classification, ranking of topic-based opinion leaders, and evaluation. The SNOL system has two main parts. In the first part, collected tweets are classified by semantic kernels for topic-based analysis. In the second part, leadership scores are given to each user in the network according to topic modeling and user modeling results. Leadership scores are then calculated with the formula generated and opinion leaders are determined for each category. Experiments are performed on data gathered from Twitter including 17,234,924 tweets from 38,727 users. The evaluation of opinion leader detection is a difficult job since there is no standard method for identifying opinion leaders. Therefore, the evaluation of the results of this study has been done using two different methods, retweet count and spread score, to prove that the suggested methodology outperforms the PageRank algorithm. The results have also been evaluated considering the user-topic sentiment correlation of the retrieved lists. Furthermore, SNOL has been compared against some opinion leader detection methods previously presented in the literature. The experimental results show that SNOL generates remarkably higher performance than the PageRank algorithm and other existing algorithms in the literature for nearly all topics and all selected top N opinion leaders.},

	abstract = {Social networking sites have a wealth of user-generated unstructured text for fine-grained sentiment analysis regarding the changing dynamics in the marketplace. In aspect-level sentiment analysis, aspect term extraction (ATE) task identifies the targets of user opinions in the sentence. In the last few years, deep learning approaches significantly improved the performance of aspect extraction. However, the performance of recent models relies on the accuracy of dependency parser and part-of-speech (POS) tagger, which degrades the performance of the system if the sentence doesn't follow the language constraints and the text contains a variety of multi-word aspect-terms. Furthermore, lack of domain and contextual information is again an issue to extract domain-specific, most relevant aspect terms. The existing approaches are not capable of capturing long term dependencies for noun phrases, which in turn fails to extract some valid aspect terms. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-step mixed unsupervised model by combining linguistic patterns with deep learning techniques to improve the ATE task. The first step uses rules-based methods to extract the single word and multi-word aspects, which further prune domain-specific relevant aspects using fine-tuned word embedding. In the second step, the extracted aspects in the first step are used as label data to train the attention-based deep learning model for aspect-term extraction. The experimental evaluation on the SemEval-16 dataset validates our approach as compared to the most recent and baseline techniques.},

Currently, scientific paper summarization faces two main challenges. First, inter-sentence relations are hard to learn, especially in the case of long-form scientific papers. Second, structural information of the well-structured scientific papers has not been fully exploited. To overcome the above two challenges, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Tree structure-based extractive Summarization (HetTreSum) model, where each document is modeled as a tree structure to learn inter-sentence relations and structural information of the original document is incorporated, enabling the tree structure to have a global perspective of the whole document. Then an iterative updating strategy is presented to interactively refine nodes of the tree structure for better contextualized representations, which can further enhance summarization performance. Experimental results on PubMed and arXiv datasets show that our proposed HetTreeSum model achieves significantly advanced performance compared with various scientific paper summarization models.},

One of the main drawbacks of existing text representation approaches is that they only utilize one aspect or view of a text e.g. They only consider texts by their words while the topic information can be extracted from text as well. The term-document and document-topic matrix are two views of a text and contain complementary information. We use the strength of both views to extract a richer representation. In this paper, we propose three different text representation methods with the help of these two matrices and tensor factorization to utilize the power of both views. The proposed approach (Tens-Embedding) was applied in the tasks of text classification, sentence-level and document-level sentiment analysis and text clustering wherein the conducted experiments on 20newsgroups, R52, R8, MR and IMDB datasets indicated the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with other document embedding techniques.},

Conventional approaches mainly demonstrated on adopting the visual features and tags, without considering other types of metadata. How to enhance the accuracy of social image annotation by fully exploiting multi-modal features is still an opening and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an improved Multi-Modal Data Fusion based Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model (MMDF-LDA) to annotate social images via fusing visual content, user-supplied tags, user comments, and geographic information. When MMDF-LDA samples annotations for one data modality, all the other data modalities are exploited. In MMDF-LDA, geographical topics are generated from GPS locations of social images, and annotations have different probability to be used in different geographical regions. A social image is divided into several patches in advance, and then MMDF-LDA assigns annotations for the patches of social images by estimating the probability of annotation-patch assignment. Through experiments in social image annotation and retrieval on several datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MMDF-LDA model in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Author profiling from text documents has become a popular task in latest years, in natural language applications. Author profiling is important for various domains such as advertising, marketing, forensics, and security. This survey focuses on profiling age and gender, the two features, which are probably the most researched profile attributes. In this paper, we present an overview of representative studies and datasets of the field (including those organized by PAN) with several significant leaps. Due to the increasing use of deep learning (DL) methods in recent years, we have also reviewed several DL systems that profile authors' age and gender. Most age and gender datasets contain blog posts or Twitter messages written in English, Spanish or Arabic. There are also several relevant datasets written in Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Turkish, and Russian. There is no consistency and no uniformity in the datasets concerning to the number and types of their documents, the division into training, dev, and test sets, the types of the applied preprocessing methods, and the quality measures used to evaluate the classification results. A prominent interesting finding is that the best age accuracy results are not as high as we might have expected taking into account relatively simple types of classification especially by gender (only 2 categories) when a large number of teams have competed over the years. Another interesting finding that repeats itself in various classification tasks is that classical ML methods are still better than DL methods for age and gender classification tasks. Most classical systems used word unigrams and bigrams and character 3--4-5-grams. Several systems also used various types of stylistic features. While many earlier systems did not apply preprocessing methods, most recent systems applied several preprocessing methods, e.g., lowercase conversion and replacement of various strings (e.g., URLs, LF characters, and User Mentions). We also suggest several potential future issues in age and gender profiling research.},

	abstract = {The key challenges for automatic hate-speech classification in Twitter are the lack of generic architecture, imprecision, threshold settings and fragmentation issues. Most studies used binary classifiers for hate speech classification, but these classifiers cannot really capture other emotions that may overlap between positive or negative class. Hence, a probabilistic clustering model for hate speech classification in twitter was developed to tackle problems with hate speech classification. A metadata extractor was used to collect tweets containing hate speech keywords and a crowd-sourced experts was employed to label the collected hate tweets into two categories: hate speech and non-hate speech. Features representation was done with Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) model and enhanced with topics inferred by a Bayes classifier. A rule-based clustering method was used to automatically classify real-time tweets into the correct topic clusters. Fuzzy logic was then used for hate speech classification using semantic fuzzy rules and a score computation module. From the evaluation results, it was observed that the developed model performed better in hate speech detection with F1-sore of 0.9256 using a 5-fold cross validation. Similarly, the developed model for hate speech classification performed better with F1-score of 91.5 compared to related models. The developed model also indicates a more perfect test having an AUC of 0.9645, when compared to similar methods. The Paired Sample t-Test validated the efficiency of the developed model for hate speech classification.},

	abstract = {When users express their stances towards a topic in social media, they might elaborate their viewpoints or reasoning. Oftentimes, viewpoints expressed by different users exhibit a hierarchical structure. Therefore, detecting this kind of hierarchical viewpoints offers a better insight to understand the public opinion. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian model for hierarchical viewpoint discovery from tweets. Driven by the motivation that a viewpoint expressed in a tweet can be regarded as a path from the root to a leaf of a hierarchical viewpoint tree, the assignment of the relevant viewpoint topics is assumed to follow two nested Chinese restaurant processes. Moreover, opinions in text are often expressed in un-semantically decomposable multi-terms or phrases, such as `economic recession'. Hence, a hierarchical Pitman--Yor process is employed as a prior for modelling the generation of phrases with arbitrary length. Experimental results on two Twitter corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian model for hierarchical viewpoint discovery.},

	abstract = {Humans must easily handle the vast amounts of data being generated by the revolution of information technology. Thus, Automatic Text summarization has been applied to various domains in order to find the most relevant information and make critical decisions quickly. In the context of Arabic, text summarization techniques suffer from several problems. First, most existing methods do not consider the context or domain to which the document belongs. Second, the majority of the existing approaches are based on the traditional bag-of-words representation, which involves high dimensional and sparse data, and makes it difficult to capture relevant information. Third, research in Arabic Text summarization is fairly small and only recently compared to that on Anglo-Saxon and other languages due to the shortage of Arabic corpora, resources, and automatic processing tools. In this paper, we try to overcome these limitations by proposing a new approach using documents clustering, topic modeling, and unsupervised neural networks in order to build an efficient document representation model. First, a new document clustering technique using Extreme learning machine is performed on large text collection. Second, topic modeling is applied to documents collection in order to identify topics present in each cluster. Third, each document is represented in a topic space by a matrix where rows represent the document sentences and columns represent the cluster topics. The generated matrix is then trained using several unsupervised neural networks and ensemble learning algorithms in order to build an abstract representation of the document in the concept space. Important sentences are ranked and extracted according to a graph model with a redundancy elimination component. The proposed approach is evaluated on Essex Arabic Summaries Corpus and compared against other Arabic text summarization approaches using ROUGE measure. Experimental results showed that the models trained on topic representation learn better representations and improve significantly the summarization performance. In particular, ensemble learning models demonstrated an important improvement on Rouge recall and promising results on F-measure.},

	abstract = {The Fintech mobile payment platform is expanding rapidly; this expansion, in turn, creates numerous risks. There is an urgent need to better understand these risks and to spur more secure payment behavior. This research aims to develop knowledge graphs of the mobile payment platform based on deep learning for risk analysis and policy inferences. We identify entities from collected policy documents, extract the relationships among the entities, and draw a risk knowledge graph on mobile payments. The use of unsupervised semi-automatic knowledge acquisition, we argue, can reduce the risk of mobile payment caused by a lack of knowledge. A significant benefit of this method is that risk knowledge can be acquired without supervision. Unlike other models, the absence of manual labeling allows for the relation extraction of triples to be unsupervised, while the previous triplet extraction was supervised. Compared with other unsupervised models, the precision of our model is improved, and the recall is the same as that of previous unsupervised shutdown extraction.Unsupervised relationship extraction can extract text relationships quickly and on a large scale, saving human resources for labeling.This method offers a potential solution to a fundamental problem; the content and quantity of policy documents exceed organizations' and individuals' ability to understand them. Our approach suggests the viability of developing a national policy risk knowledge graph to help mobile payment platforms understand national policies and reduce platforms' operational risks while allowing users to quickly learn the risks of mobile payments and minimize the impact of those risks.},

	abstract = {Classification of investors' sentiments in stock message boards has attracted a great deal of attention. Since the messages are usually short, we propose a semi-supervised learning method to make full use of the features in both train and test messages. The generative emotion model takes message, emotion and words into consideration simultaneously. Based on the facts that words are of different ability in discriminating sentiments, they are categorized into three classes in the model with different emotion strength. Training the generative model can transform the messages into emotion vectors which finally feeds to a sentiment classifier. The experiment results show that the proposed model and learning method are efficient for modeling sentiment in short text, and by properly selecting the amount of train data and the percent of test samples, we can achieve higher classification accuracy than traditional ones. The results indicate that the generative model is effective for short message sentiment classification, and provides a significant approach for the implementation of semi-supervised learning which is a typical expert and intelligent information processing method.},

	abstract = {The increasing online reviews play an essential role in the e-commerce platform, which profoundly affects the purchase decisions of consumers. However, rampant dishonest sellers manipulate other buyers or robots to post deceptive reviews for profit. Recently, the detection of deceptive reviews has attracted general research attention, which mainly comprises two directions, traditional methods based on statistics and intelligent methods based on neural networks. These methods use a single feature or multiple features for classifier design. To make full use of different features for better feature representation of detecting deceptive reviews, this paper proposes a new feature fusion strategy and verifies its performance by comparing it with other feature fusion strategies. First, we utilize three independent models for feature extraction: the TextCNN, the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the Self-Attention are used to learn local semantic features, temporal semantic features, and weighted semantic features of reviews, respectively. Secondly, after obtaining different feature representations from the fully connected layers of these three models, we concatenate them together to form the final documental representation. Finally, we use a full connection layer and the sigmoid function to further learn and complete deceptive review detection. Experiments on three balanced and unbalanced in-domain small datasets (hotel, restaurant, doctor) and mixed-domain datasets show that our model is superior to baselines. Experiments on large-scale data with various imbalanced proportions verify the effectiveness of our method. We also analyze the results of different datasets from the perspective of part of speech to improve the model's interpretability.},

One big issue in QE is the selection of the right candidate terms for expansion. For this purpose Linked Data can be used, as a valuable resource, for providing additional expansion features such as the values of sub- and super classes of resources. The underlying research question is whether interlinked data and vocabulary items provide features which can be taken into account for query expansion. In this paper, we introduced a new QE approach that aimed at improving IRS by using the well-known distribution based method Bose-Einstein statistics (Bo1) as well as Linked Data from the knowledge base DBpedia using different numbers of expansion terms. We evaluated the effectiveness of each method individually as well as their combinations using two Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) test collections. Our approach has lead to significant improvement in terms of precision, recall, Mean Average Precision (MAP) at rank 10, and normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) at different ranks compared to Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF) that we used as a baseline. The results show that the inclusion of semantic annotations clearly improves the retrieval performance over the baseline method.},

The purpose of clickbait is to bring an appealing link in front of users. Clickbaits seen in the form of headlines influence people to get attracted and curious to read the inside content. The content seen in the form of text on clickbait posts is very short to identify its features as clickbait. In this paper, a novel approach (two-phase hybrid CNN-LSTM Biterm model) has been proposed for modeling short topic content. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model when implemented with pre-trained GloVe embedding yields the best results based on accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score performance metrics. The proposed model achieves 91.24%, 95.64%, 95.87% precision values for Dataset 1, Dataset 2 and Dataset 3, respectively. Eight types of clickbait such as Reasoning, Number, Reaction, Revealing, Shocking/Unbelievable, Hypothesis/Guess, Questionable, Forward referencing are classified in this work using the Biterm Topic Model (BTM). It has been shown that the clickbaits such as Shocking/Unbelievable, Hypothesis/Guess and Reaction are the highest in numbers among rest of the clickbait headlines published online. Also, a ground dataset of non-textual (image-based) data using multiple social media platforms has been created in this paper. The textual information has been retrieved from the images with the help of OCR tool. A comparative study is performed to show the effectiveness of our proposed model which helps to identify the various categories of clickbait headlines that are spread on social media platforms.},

Accordingly, this research focuses on a fake review detection method that incorporates review-related features including linguistic features, Part-of-Speech (POS) features, and sentiment analysis features. A domain feature ontology is used in the feature-level sentiment analysis and all the review-related features are extracted and integrated into the ontology. The fake review detection is enhanced through a rule-based classifier by inferencing the ontology. Due to the lack of a labeled dataset for model training, the Mahalanobis distance method was used to detect outliers from an unlabeled dataset where the outliers were selected as fake reviews for model training. The performance measures of the rule-based classifier were improved by integrating linguistic features, POS features, and sentiment analysis features, in spite of considering them separately.},

There are tasks required to be fulfilled during the text categorization, such as extracting useful data from different perspectives, reducing the high feature space dimension, and improving effectiveness. In order to accomplish these tasks, feature selection, and feature extraction gain importance. This paper investigates how to solve feature selection and extraction problems. Also, this study aims to decide which topics are the focus of a document. Moreover, the Twitter data-set is utilized as a document and an Uncapacitated P-Median Problem (UPMP) is applied to make clustering. In this study, UPMP is used on Twitter data collection for the first time to collect clustered tweets. Therefore, a novel hybrid genetic bat algorithm (HGBA) is proposed to solve the UPMP for our case. The proposed novel approach is applied to analyze the Twitter data-set of the Nepal earthquake. The first part of the analysis includes the data pre-processing stage. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method is applied to the pre-processed text. After that, a similarity (distance) matrix is generated by utilizing the Jensen Shannon Divergence (JSD) model. The study's main goal is to use Twitter to assess the needs of victims during and after a disaster. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed approach, experiments are conducted on the OR-Library data-set. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully extracts topics and categorizes text.},

	abstract = {Social network analysis is a fundamental problem inherent in various applications, which can be handled mainly based on a graph model given in advance. However, it is generally ignored in most existing studies that the social networks may only contain users and no users' connections are explicitly available. Then the connections between users play a considerable role in building the graph, and it is necessary to calculate users' similarities. Traditional methods of user similarity calculation are extensively based on the topics of text content because they can effectively reflect users' interests. Nevertheless, these methods mostly ignore the importance of time series in the texts, where the texts with time series can reveal the activity trends of users in social networks. In this work, we explore a new problem of building a social network graph over text with time series. Our basic idea is that social media users are more similar if they have similar text semantics in similar time sequences. To obtain the semantics of text with time series, we extract topic words of each user from the corresponding text with our proposed Time-Biterm Topic Model (T-BTM), which improves the BTM model by taking the time-topic distribution into account. On this basis, we further propose a novel time series-based graph model with text, called Text with Time series for Graph (TT-Graph) model, which explicitly considers the user similarity and time series similarity. With the TT-Graph model, we propose novel methods for topic detection, community detection, and link prediction in social network analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that topic detection, community detection and link prediction can be effectively conducted on the TT-Graph model, and the credibility of our model can be proved.},

	abstract = {The classical high-order rating distance model which aims to minimize not only (i) the difference between the estimated and real ratings of the same user--item pair (i.e., the first-order rating distance), but also (ii) the difference between the estimated and real rating difference of the same user across different items (i.e., the second-order rating distance), and use stochastic gradient descent to solve this convex optimization problem in recommender systems, has good performance in prediction accuracy. However, when the manually set parameter for the second-order rating difference is fixed, this model will not converge as the size of dataset increasing, and its performance on efficiency is slow compared with the matrix factorization method. Aiming at improving such model's adaptability and efficiency, we propose an improved high-order rating distance model with omitting rules based on slack variable, in which the static parameter used to balance the first-order rating distance and the second-order rating distance is replaced by a data-scale sensitive function. We choose Newton method to solve the convex recommendation optimization problem defined in this paper instead of stochastic gradient descent. Our model not only achieves the adaptability by eliminating several static parameters for module balancing, reduces the computation complexity, but also accelerates the optimization function convergence speed. We provide solid theoretical support and conduct comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets. Experimental results show the proposed model has good performance in terms of prediction accuracy and efficiency.},

	abstract = {Cancer is a worldwide problem and one of the leading causes of death. Increasing prevalence of cancer, particularly in developing countries, demands better understandings of the effectiveness and adverse consequences of different cancer treatment regimes in real patient populations. Current understandings of cancer treatment toxicities are often derived from either ``clean'' patient cohorts or coarse population statistics. Thus, it is difficult to get up-to-date and local assessments of treatment toxicities for specific cancer centers. To address these problems, we propose a novel and efficient method for discovering toxicity progression patterns in the form of temporal association rules (TARs). A temporal association rule is defined as a rule where the diagnosis codes in the right hand side (e.g., a combination of toxicities/complications) are temporally occurred after the diagnosis codes in the left hand side (e.g., a particular type of cancer treatment). Our method develops a lattice structure to efficiently discover TARs. More specifically, the lattice structure is first constructed to store all frequent diagnosis codes in the dataset. It is then traversed using the paternity relations among nodes to generate TARs. Our extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method in discovering major toxicity patterns in comparison with the temporal comorbidity analysis. In addition, our method significantly outperforms existing methods for mining TARs in terms of runtime.},

	abstract = {In the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, and particularly within the area of Machine Learning (ML), recommender systems have attracted significant research attention. These systems attempt to alleviate the increasing information overload that users can experience in the current Big Data era, by providing personalized recommendations of items that they may find relevant. Besides, given the importance of mobile computing, these systems have evolved to consider also the dynamic context of the mobile users (location, time, weather conditions, etc.) to offer them more appropriate suggestions and information while on the move. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey of recent advances towards intelligent mobile Context-Aware Recommender Systems (mobile CARS) from an information management perspective, with an emphasis on mobile computing and AI techniques, along with an analysis of existing research gaps and future research directions. We focus on approaches that go beyond just considering the location of the user and exploit also other context information. In this study, we have identified that deep learning approaches are promising artificial intelligence models for mobile CARS. Additionally, in a near future, we expect a higher prominence of push-based recommendation solutions where at least part of the recommendation engine could be executed in the mobile devices, which could share data and tasks in a distributed way.},

	abstract = {Various methods have been put forward to perform automatic social-based event detection and description. Yet, most of them do not capture the semantic meaning embedded in online social media data, which are usually highly heterogeneous and unstructured, and do not identify event relationships (e.g., car accident temporally occurs after storm, and geographically occurs near soccer match). To address this problem, we introduce a generic Social-based Event Detection, Description, and Linkage framework titled SEDDaL, taking as input: a collection of social media objects from heterogeneous sources (e.g., Flickr, YouTube, and Twitter), and producing as output a collection of semantically meaningful events interconnected with spatial, temporal, and semantic relationships. The latter are required as the building blocks for event-based Collective Knowledge (CK) organization, where CK underlines the combination of all known data, information, and metadata concerning a given concept or event. SEDDaL consists of four main modules for: i) describing social media objects in a generic Metadata Representation Space Model (MRSM) consisting of three composite dimensions: temporal, spatial, and semantic, ii) evaluating the similarity between social media objects' descriptions following MRSM, iii) detecting events from similar social media objects using an adapted unsupervised learning algorithm, where events are represented as clusters of objects in MRSM, and iv) identifying directional, metric, and topological relationships between events following MRSM's dimensions. We believe this is the first study to provide a generic model for describing semantic-aware events and their relationships extracted from social metadata on the Web. Experimental results confirm the quality and potential of our approach.},

@article{ZHANG201849,
	abstract = {In the one-class collaborative filtering (OCCF) scenario, the elements of the user-item rating matrix consist each take one of only two values: either ``like'' or unknown. Previous methods for solving the OCCF problem can be roughly categorized into content-based methods, pointwise methods, and pairwise methods. A fundamental assumption of these approaches is that all missing values in a rating matrix can be treated as ``dislike''. However, this assumption may not hold because the missing values are not always negative. Sometimes users do not give positive feedback on an item simply because they are not familiar with it rather than because they dislike it. In addition, content-based methods usually require textual information on the items. In many cases, however, sufficient textual information is not available; therefore, content-based methods are not applicable. Moreover, a user's preference for items usually drifts over time, but the previous methods cannot capture the temporal dynamics of this drift. In this paper, we propose to modify the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to address the above-mentioned problems. Our method uses only observed rating data to predict users' interests and effectively avoids the issue of data skew. Furthermore, to address the issue that users' preferences for items usually drift over time, we assign a different weight to each rating according to its timestamp when using Gibbs sampling to estimate the parameters of the LDA model. In this way, the temporal dynamics of the user preferences can be captured. We report experiments conducted to evaluate our model. The results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for the OCCF problem.},

@article{WEN2020106344,
	abstract = {Traditional recommender systems encounter several challenges such as data sparsity and unexplained recommendation. To address these challenges, many works propose to exploit semantic information from review data. However, these methods have two major limitations in terms of the way to model textual features and capture textual interaction. For textual modeling, they simply concatenate all the reviews of a user/item into a single review. However, feature extraction at word/phrase level can violate the meaning of the original reviews. As for textual interaction, they defer the interactions to the prediction layer, making them fail to capture complex correlations between users and items. To address those limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Text Interaction model (HTI) for rating prediction. In HTI, we propose to model low-level word semantics and high-level review representations hierarchically. The hierarchy allows us to exploit textual features at different granularities. To further capture complex user--item interactions, we propose to exploit semantic correlations between each user--item pair at different hierarchies. At word level, we propose an attention mechanism specialized to each user--item pair, and capture the important words for representing each review. At review level, we mutually propagate textual features between the user and item, and capture the informative reviews. The aggregated review representations are integrated into a collaborative filtering framework for rating prediction. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that HTI outperforms state-of-the-art models by a large margin. Further case studies provide a deep insight into HTI's ability to capture semantic correlations at different levels of granularities for rating prediction.},

	abstract = {Text document clustering is to divide textual contents into clusters or groups. It received wide attention due to the vast amount of daily data from the Web. In the last decade, Meta-Heuristic (MH) techniques have been adopted to solve clustering problems. Motivated by that, the authors introduce a reliable version of the newly developed MH algorithm called Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA). Math arithmetic operators inspire the AOA: multiplication, subtraction adding, and division. The AOA showed good performance in several global problems; nonetheless, it suffers from entrapment in local optima in complicated and high dimensional problems. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved version of AOA for the text document clustering problem. The Improved AOA (IAOA) introduces an integration between Opposition-based learning (OBL) and Levy flight distribution (LFD) with AOA to tackle the limitations of the traditional AOA. The IAOA is examined with different UCI datasets for the text clustering problems and assessed with a set of CEC2019 benchmark functions as a global optimization algorithm with extensive comparison to existing optimization algorithms. Overall, experimental results show the superiority of the proposed IAOA compared to several optimization algorithms. Moreover, the proposed IAOA is compared with twenty-one state-of-the-art methods using thirty-one benchmark text datasets, and the results proved the superiority of the proposed IAOA.},

	abstract = {In social network analysis, community detection is a basic step to understand the structure and function of networks. Some conventional community detection methods may have limited performance because they merely focus on the networks' topological structure. Besides topology, content information is another significant aspect of social networks. Although some state-of-the-art methods started to combine these two aspects of information for the sake of the improvement of community partitioning, they often assume that topology and content carry similar information. In fact, for some examples of social networks, the hidden characteristics of content may unexpectedly mismatch with topology. To better cope with such situations, we introduce a novel community detection method under the framework of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Our proposed method integrates topology as well as content of networks and has an adaptive parameter (with two variations) to effectively control the contribution of content with respect to the identified mismatch degree. Based on the disjoint community partition result, we also introduce an additional overlapping community discovery algorithm, so that our new method can meet the application requirements of both disjoint and overlapping community detection. The case study using real social networks shows that our new method can simultaneously obtain the community structures and their corresponding semantic description, which is helpful to understand the semantics of communities. Related performance evaluations on both artificial and real networks further indicate that our method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting more robust behavior when the mismatch between topology and content is observed.},

	abstract = {Online recommender systems generally suffer from severe data sparsity problems, and this are particularly prevalent in newly launched systems that do not have sufficient amounts of data. Cross-domain recommendations can provide us with some new ideas for assisting with user recommendations in sparse target domains by transferring knowledge from a source domain with rich data. In this paper, a deep sparse autoencoder prediction model based on adversarial learning for cross-domain recommendations (DSAP-AL) is proposed to improve the accuracy of rating predictions in similar cross-domain recommender systems. Specifically, joint matrix factorization and adversarial network learning models are adopted to integrate and align user and item latent factor spaces in a unified pattern. Then, a deep sparse autoencoder is represented and modeled by transferring the latent factors and interlayer weights. Furthermore, a domain factor adaptation algorithm is proposed to capture robust user and item factors, and the learned regularization constraints are added to the objective function, thereby alleviating the data sparsity issue. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that, even without overlapping entities (users or items) in the source and target domains, the proposed DSAP-AL method achieves competitive performance relative to other state-of-the-art individual and cross domain approaches. Moreover, the DSAP-AL model is not only effective for scenarios with sparse data but also robust for noise-containing recommendations.},

To facilitate this study, we introduce a new dataset with human judgments of entity relatedness. No clear dominance is seen between measures based on textual similarity and graph proximity. Some of the better measures involve expensive global graph computations. We propose a new, space-efficient, computationally lightweight, two-stage framework for relatedness computation. In the first stage, a small weighted subgraph is dynamically grown around the two query entities; in the second stage, relatedness is derived based on computations on this subgraph. Our system shows better agreement with human judgment than existing proposals both on the new dataset and on an established one.

	abstract = {Current Online Social Networks represent a means for the continuous generation and distribution of information, which is slightly changed when moving from a user to another during the traversing of the network. Such an amount of information can overcome the capacity of a single user to manage it, so it would be useful to reduce it so that the user is able to have a summary of the information flowing the network. To this aim, it is of crucial importance to detect events within such an information stream, composing of the most representative words containing in each information instance, representing the event described by the set of tweet categorized together. There is a vast literature on off-line event detection on data-sets acquired from online social networks, but a similar solid set of approaches is missing if the detection has to be done on-line, which is demanding by the current applications. The driving idea described in this paper is to realize on-line clustering of tweets by leveraging on evolutionary game theory and the replicator dynamics, which have been used with success in many classification problems and/or multiobjective optimizations. We have adapted and enhanced a evolutionary clustering from the literature to meet the needs of on-line tweet clustering.

	abstract = {Due to the short attention span and instant gratification phenomenon, micro-videos are growing exponentially while gaining more and more concerns. Yet the sheer number of micro-videos leads to severe information overload issues, making it difficult for users to identify their desired micro-videos. The hashtag, mainly utilized in the domain of the microblog or the image, is the indicator or the core idea of the target content and can be applied to various information retrieval scenarios (e.g., search, browse, and categorization). So far, however, little attention has been paid to perform the hashtag recommendation for micro-videos via harnessing multiple modalities. In this article, we devise a neural network-based solution, LOGO (short for ``muLti-mOdal-based hashtaG recOmmendation''), to recommend hashtags for micro-videos by utilizing multiple modalities. The proposed LOGO approach first represents each modality as the combination of sequential units in it, weighted by the attention mechanism. In this way, the sequential and attentive features are captured simultaneously. After that, the LOGO integrates the representations of all modalities via a multi-view representation learning framework, which projects the representations into a common space under the restriction of the modality similarity. Ultimately, the LOGO feed the projections of three modalities in the common space and the embeddings of hashtags into a customized neural collaborative filtering framework to perform the hashtag recommendation. Extensive experiments on the scope of both overall performance comparison and micro-level analyses have well-justified the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Social network analysis provides meaningful information about behavior of network members that can be used for diverse applications such as classification, link prediction. However, network analysis is computationally expensive because of feature learning for different applications. In recent years, many researches have focused on feature learning methods in social networks. Network embedding represents the network in a lower dimensional representation space with the same properties which presents a compressed representation of the network. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm named ``CARE'' for network embedding that can be used for different types of networks including weighted, directed and complex. Current methods try to preserve local neighborhood information of nodes, whereas the proposed method utilizes local neighborhood and community information of network nodes to cover both local and global structure of social networks. CARE builds customized paths, which are consisted of local and global structure of network nodes, as a basis for network embedding and uses the Skip-gram model to learn representation vector of nodes. Subsequently, stochastic gradient descent is applied to optimize our objective function and learn the final representation of nodes. Our method can be scalable when new nodes are appended to network without information loss. Parallelize generation of customized random walks is also used for speeding up CARE. We evaluate the performance of CARE on multi label classification and link prediction tasks. Experimental results on various networks indicate that the proposed method outperforms others in both Micro and Macro-f1 measures for different size of training data.},

	abstract = {Recently, a large number of geo-tagged landmark images have been uploaded through various social media services. Usually, these geo-tagged images are annotated by users with GPS and tags related to the landmarks where they are taken. Landmark tagging aims to automatically annotate an image with the tags to describe the landmark where the image is taken. It has been observed that the images and tags show strong correlation with the geographical locations. The widely used assumption by many existing tagging methods is that images are independently and identically distributed is not effective to capture the geographical correlation. In this paper, we study the novel problem of utilizing the geographical correlation among images and landmarks for better tagging landmark images. In particular, we propose an unsupervised feature learning approach to learn the geographically discriminative features across geographical locations, by integrating latent space learning and geographically structural analysis (LSGSA) into a joint model. A latent space learning model is proposed to effectively fuse the heterogeneous features of visual content and tags. Meanwhile, the geographical structure analysis and group sparsity are applied to learn the geographically discriminative features. Then, a geo-guided sparse reconstruction method is proposed to tag images by utilizing the discriminative information of features, in which the landmark-specific tags are boosted by a weighting method. Experiments on the real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

In this study, we present MoralStrength, a lexicon of approximately 1,000 lemmas, obtained as an extension of the Moral Foundations Dictionary, based on WordNet synsets. Moreover, for each lemma it provides with a crowdsourced numeric assessment of Moral Valence, indicating the strength with which a lemma is expressing the specific value. We evaluated the predictive potentials of this moral lexicon, defining three utilization approaches of increased complexity, ranging from lemmas' statistical properties to a deep learning approach of word embeddings based on semantic similarity. Logistic regression models trained on the features extracted from MoralStrength, significantly outperformed the current state-of-the-art, reaching an F1-score of 87.6% over the previous 62.4% (p-value <0.01), and an average F1-Score of 86.25% over six different datasets.

	abstract = {A novel text summarization framework referred to as Skip-Though Vector and Bi-encoder Based Automatic Text Summarization (STV--BEATS) is proposed in this paper. STV--BEATS utilizes --- (a) skip-though vector to generate sentence-based embedding; and (b) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based deep autoencoder to reduce dimensions of skip thought vectors. STV--BEATS works in the conjunction of extractive and abstractive summarization models to enhance the overall quality of the results. For each sentence, relevance and novelty metrics are calculated on the intermediate representation of the deep autoencoder to generate the final sentence score. The highly scored sentences are selected to generate an extractive summary. On the other hand, the abstractive part is composed of two encoders and a decoder which works as --- (a) the first GRU-based bi-directional encoder and decoder work as basic sequence-to-sequence model on the extractive summary; and (b) the second GRU-based unidirectional encoder is used for fine encoding. Extensive computer experiments are conducted to determine the effectiveness of the STV--BEATS. Three standard benchmark datasets, namely, CNN/Daily Mail, DUC-2004, and DUC-2002 are used during experiments. Further, recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation (ROUGE) is used for validation of the STV--BEATS. Result reveals that the proposed STV--BEATS is capable of effective text summarization and achieves substantially better results over the state-of-the-art models.},

	abstract = {As more and more conversation-oriented streaming videos become available, streaming platforms have gradually taken the place of traditional media for people to access information. Still, conversation-oriented streaming videos are often lengthy and people are reluctant to view the whole video. In this research, we investigated highlight extraction on conversation-oriented streaming videos. Previous highlight extraction methods analyzed visual features of videos and are therefore unable to deal with conservation-oriented streaming videos whose highlights are related to streamer discourses and viewer responses. For this reason, the proposed highlight extraction method called COHETS does not evaluate visual features but rather simultaneously examines textual streams of streamer discourses and viewer messages to extract meaningful highlights. Experiments based on real world streaming data demonstrate that streamer discourses and viewer responses via their feedback messages are useful for extracting highlights of conversation-oriented streaming videos. Also, our designed position enrichment and message attention techniques effectively distill the embeddings of the two textual streams and lead to extraction results that are superior to those of state-of-the-art deep learning-based highlight extraction methods and extraction-based text summarization methods.},

	abstract = {Making machines understand language and reasoning on it has been one of the most challenging problems addressed by Artificial Intelligent researchers. This challenge increases when figurative language is used for communicating complex meanings, intentions, emotions and attitudes in creative and funny ways. In fact, sentiment analysis approaches struggle when facing irony, satire and other figurative languages, particularly those where the explanation of a prediction might arguably be as necessary as the prediction itself. This paper describes a new model MvAttLSTM based on deep learning for irony and satire detection in tweets written in distinct Spanish variants. The proposed model is based on an attentive-LSTM informed with three additional views learned from distinct perspectives. We investigate two strategies to pass these views into MvAttLSTM. We perform an extensive evaluation on three corpora, one for irony detection and two for satire detection. Moreover, in order to study the robustness of our proposed model, we investigate its performance on humor recognition. Experiments confirm that the proposed views help our model to improve its performance. Moreover, they show that affective information benefits our model to detect irony and satire. In particular, a first analysis of the results highlights the discriminating power of emotional features obtained from SenticNet and SEL lexicon. Overall, our system achieves the state-of-the-art performance in irony and satire detection in Spanish variants and competitive results in humor recognition.},

The main contribution of this paper is a framework that characterizes context-aware recommendation processes in terms of: i) the recommendation techniques used at every stage of the process, ii) the techniques used to incorporate context, and iii) the stages of the process where context is integrated into the system. This systematic literature review provides a clear understanding about the integration of context into recommender systems, including context types more frequently used in the different application domains and validation mechanisms---explained in terms of the used datasets, properties, metrics, and evaluation protocols.

Social sensing has emerged as a new application paradigm, where a crowd of social sources (humans or devices on their behalf) collectively contribute a large amount of observations about the physical world. This paper studies an interesting place finding problem, in which the goal is to correctly identify the interesting places in a city. Important challenges exist in solving this problem: (i) the interestingness of a place is not only related to the number of users who visit it, but also depends upon the travel experience of the visiting users; (ii) the user's social connections could directly affect their visiting behavior and the interestingness judgment of a given place. In this paper, we develop a new Social-aware Interesting Place Finding Plus (SIPF+) approach that addresses the above challenges by explicitly incorporating both the user's travel experience and social relationship into a rigorous analytical framework. The SIPF+ scheme can find interesting places not typically identified by traditional travel websites (e.g., TripAdvisor, Expedia).

It is accomplished by identifying opinion aspect entities (including object entities and attribute entities) and then aligning object entities to attribute entities. Recent studies on knowledge graphs have shown that by adding the embeddings of semantic structures between opinion aspect entities, structure-based learning models can achieve better performance in link-prediction than traditional methods. The studies, however, focused only on learning semantic structures between aspect entities, did not take language expression features into account. In this paper, we propose the Fusion RElation Embedded Representation Learning (FREERL) framework, by which, one can fuse semantic structures and language expression features such as statistical co-occurrence or dependency syntax, into the embeddings of object entities and attribute entities. The obtained embeddings are then used to align object-attribute pairs and to predict new pairs in a zero-shot scenario. Experimental results on the datasets of COAE2014 and COAE2015 show that the best results in our framework achieve 12.1% and 32.1% improvements over the baselines, respectively.},

A researcher may certainly know of a few leading venues for her specific field of interest. However, a venue recommendation system becomes particularly helpful when exploring a new domain or when more options are needed. Due to high dimensionality and sparsity of text data, and complex semantics of the natural language, journal identification presents difficult challenges.

Nowadays, its relevance has been highlighted thanks to several applications in computer forensics, security and marketing. Most previous contributions in AP have been devoted to determine a suitable set of features to model the writing profile of authors. However, in social media this task is challenging due to the informal communication. In this regard, we present a novel approach, which considers that terms located in phrases exposing personal information have a special value for discriminating the author's profile. The aim of this research work is to emphasize the value of such personal phrases by means of two new proposals: a feature selection method and term weighting scheme, both based on a novel measure called Personal Expression Intensity (PEI) which scores the quantity of personal information revealed by a term.

Average improvements of 7.34% and 5.76% for age and gender classification were obtained when comparing to the best result from state-of-the-art, indicating that personal phrases play a key role for the AP task by means of selecting and weighting terms.},

	abstract = {A great variety of text tasks such as topic or spam identification, user profiling, and sentiment analysis can be posed as a supervised learning problem and tackled using a text classifier. A text classifier consists of several subprocesses, some of them are general enough to be applied to any supervised learning problem, whereas others are specifically designed to tackle a particular task using complex and computational expensive processes such as lemmatization, syntactic analysis, etc. Contrary to traditional approaches, we propose a minimalist and multi-propose text-classifier able to tackle tasks independently of domain and language. We named our approach μTC. Our approach is composed of several easy-to-implement text transformations, text representations, and a supervised learning algorithm. These pieces produce a competitive classifier in several challenging domains such as informally written text. We provide a detailed description of μTC along with an extensive experimental comparison with relevant state-of-the-art methods, i.e., μTC was compared on 30 different datasets. Regarding accuracy, μTC obtained the best performance in 20 datasets while achieves competitive results in the remaining ones. The compared datasets include several problems like topic and polarity classification, spam detection, user profiling and authorship attribution. Furthermore, our approach allows the usage of the technology even without an in-depth knowledge of machine learning and natural language processing.},

	abstract = {In the procedure of Web search, a user first comes up with an information need and a query is issued with the need as guidance. After that, some URLs are clicked and other queries may be issued if those URLs do not meet his need well. We advocate that Web search is governed by a unified hidden space, and each involved element such as query and URL has its inborn position, i.e., projected as a vector, in this space. Each of above actions in the search procedure, i.e. issuing queries or clicking URLs, is an interaction result of those elements in the space. In this paper, we aim at uncovering such a unified hidden space of Web search that uniformly captures the hidden semantics of search queries, URLs and other involved elements in Web search. We learn the semantic space with search session data, because a search session can be regarded as an instantiation of users' information need on a particular semantic topic and it keeps the interaction information of queries and URLs. We use a set of session graphs to represent search sessions, and the space learning task is cast as a vector learning problem for the graph vertices by maximizing the log-likelihood of a training session data set. Specifically, we developed the well-known Word2vec to perform the learning procedure. Experiments on the query log data of a commercial search engine are conducted to examine the efficacy of learnt vectors, and the results show that our framework is helpful for different finer tasks in Web search.},

However, a lot of published articles are shared via SSN every day which make it difficult for researchers to find highly valuable articles. To solve above information overload problem, a novel hybrid approach integrating with social information, i.e., HAR-SI, is proposed for the article recommendation in SSN. Unlike the traditional CBF and CF recommendation approaches, the social tag information and social friend information, which have been proved playing a significant role on recommendation in many domains, are effectively integrated into these two approaches separately to improve the accuracy in SSN. Prediction results made by the improved CBF and CF separately are combined with a hybrid method. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed HAR-SI, a real-life dataset from CiteULike was employed. Experimental results show that the proposed approach provides higher quality recommendations than the baseline methods, thus providing a more effective manner to recommend articles in SSN.},

In a strategic and economic context where cost control is fundamental, it has become necessary to identify the relevant job board for a given new job offer has become necessary. The purpose of this work is to present the recent results that we have obtained on a new job board recommendation system that is a decision-making tool intended to guide recruiters while they are posting a job on the Internet. Firstly, the Doc2Vec embedded representation is used to analyse the textual content of the job offers, then the job applicant clickstreams history on various job boards are stored in a large learning database, and then represented as time series. Secondly, a deep neural network architecture is used to predict future values of the clicks on the job boards. Third, and in parallel, dimensionality reduction techniques are used to transform the clicks numerical time series into temporal symbolic sequences. Forecasting algorithms are then used to predict future symbols for each sequence. Finally, a list of top ranked job boards are kept by maximizing the clickstreams forecasting in both representations. Our experiments are tested on a real dataset, coming from a job-posting database of an industrial partner. The promising results have shown that using deep learning, the recommendation system outperforms standard multivariate models.},

	abstract = {Observed rating data in Web2.0 applications concerns user attributes and rating scores, which explicitly reflects users' overall evaluation on events, products and various informative items. However, the unobservable user preference is critical for personalized services, precise marketing, accurate advertising, etc. In this paper, by adopting Bayesian network (BN) with a latent variable as the knowledge framework to describe user preference using the latent variable, we propose user preference Bayesian network (UPBN) to represent dependence relations among the latent and observed variables. By incorporating the classic expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and scoring & search idea for learning a BN, we focus on UPBN construction from rating data, i.e., the learning of probability parameters and graphical structure. To make UPBN fit the rating data, we first give the constraints of structure and parameters in terms of inherence dependencies among user preference, latent variable and characteristics of EM. Consequently, we present a parallel and constraint induced algorithm for UPBN construction based on EM, structural EM (SEM) and Bayesian information criterion. To deal with the large amount of iterations of probability computations and guarantee the efficiency of model construction, we implement our algorithms upon Spark for the massive intermediate results and large scale rating datasets. Experimental results show the expressiveness of UPBN for preference modeling and the efficiency of model construction, and also demonstrate that UPBN outperforms some state-of-the-art models for user preference estimation and rating prediction.},

In this framework, all users are partitioned into several clusters by a newly designed Memetic Algorithm (MA) based clustering method. Normal users are recommended items obtained by applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to users within each cluster. For cold-start users, each cluster is viewed as a new user. Each cluster is recommended a list of items by applying LDA to all clusters. The recommendation list to the querying cluster is recommended to all cold-start users in this cluster. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art location and tag aware recommendation algorithms, the proposed algorithm has better performance on making recommendations and alleviating cold-start problem.},

The traditional recommendation approaches are crucial for Internet users to extract valuable information from various information. However, there exist some problems such as sparse data, cold start, and over-reliance on manual extracted feature and so on. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a novel recommender with Attention-based Convolutional Neural Network and Factorization Machines (ACNN-FM), which achieves the recommendation with comments. Firstly, from the perspective of local to overall, this paper proposes a word-level attention mechanism and a phrase-level attention mechanism to increase the ability to remember the importance and the order of historical vocabulary (phrase) in the process of text processing of convolutional neural networks. Secondly, it constructs a model to automatically extract hidden features of users and items from comments in the form of natural language. Finally, we utilize factorization machines to analyze the association between the hidden features of users and items, and implement the recommendation based on the association. Extensive experiments are conducted for demonstrating that ACNN-FM method outperforms state-of-the-art NARR method, and ACNN-FM has the highest data utilization among NARR, DeepCoNN, BCF and NMF methods, thus the recommendation performance is significantly improved in large-scale data environment.},

However, large amount of pairwise image--text data required restricts generalization of synthesis models only to its pre-trained language. In this paper, a cross-lingual pre-training method is proposed to adapt target low-resource language to pre-trained generative models. As far as we known, this is the first time that arbitrary input languages could access T2I generation. This joint encoding scheme fulfills both universal and visual semantic alignment. With any prepared GAN-based T2I framework, pre-trained source encoder model could be easily fine-tuned to construct target encoder model and hence entirely enable transfer of T2I synthesis ability between languages. After that, a semantic-level alignment independent of source T2I structure is established to guarantee optimal text consistency and detail generation. Different from monolingual T2I methods that apply discriminator to enhance generation quality, we use an adversarial training scheme that optimizes the sentence-level alignment along with the word-level alignment with a self-attention mechanism. Considering of training for low-resource languages lack of parallel texts in practice, target input embedding is designed available for zero-shot learning. Experimental results prove robustness of the proposed cross-lingual T2I pre-training on multiple downstream generative models and target languages applied.},

	abstract = {Last decade has witnessed a drastically increasing development of smart devices, while related mobile applications have emerged significantly in people's daily life. As such, understanding the pattern of mobile application usage and related online behavior is of great importance for a variety of purposes, such as application engineering, resource optimization, and marketing. Existing research of online usage discovery includes surveys from end-users, application provider-related analysis, and usage log mining. These works, however, suffer from some limitations, such as lacking of user socio-economics background, insufficient coverage and sample bias, etc. A novel and comprehensive application-usage profiling algorithm, termed as TAG, is proposed in this study to investigate online behavior. The proposed algorithm consists of three major steps: (i) T-step: representing usage data as a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency based matrix; (ii) A-step: applying Alternating Least Squares factorization technique to reduce data sparseness and dimension; and last (iii) G-step: utilizing a smoothed Gaussian Mixture Model for clustering purpose. The performance of the proposed TAG algorithm is evaluated, taking a national dataset generated from 31,280 devices and 30,155 applications over 30 months as an example. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods via forming accurate usage groups from school-level online behavior. As such, the superior clustering outcome demonstrates the flexibility and applicability of the proposed work for understanding online pattern using complex application usage data. Resultant knowledge can in turn be used to inform decision making and improve application development.},

	abstract = {Serial crimes pose a great threat to public security. Linking crimes committed by the same offender can assist the detecting of serial crimes and is of great importance in maintaining public security. Currently, most crime analysts still link serial crimes empirically especially in China and desire quantitative tools to help them. This paper presents a decision support system for crime linkage based on various, including behavioral, features of criminal cases. Its underlying technique is pairwise classification based on similarity, which is interpretable and easy to tune. We design feature similarity algorithms to calculate the pairwise similarities and build up a classifier to determine whether a case pair should belong to a series. A comprehensive case study of a real-world robbery dataset demonstrates its promising performance even with the default setting. This system has been deployed in a public security bureau of China and running for more than one year with positive feedback from users. The use of this system would provide individual officers with strong support in crimes investigation then allow law enforcement agency to save resources, since the system not only can link serial crimes automatically based on a classification model learned from historical crime data, but also has flexibility in training data update and domain experts interaction, including adjusting the key components like similarity matrices and decision thresholds to reach a good tradeoff between caseload and number of true linked pairs.},

	abstract = {Traditional stock market prediction approaches commonly utilize the historical price-related data of the stocks to forecast their future trends. As the Web information grows, recently some works try to explore financial news to improve the prediction. Effective indicators, e.g., the events related to the stocks and the people's sentiments toward the market and stocks, have been proved to play important roles in the stocks' volatility, and are extracted to feed into the prediction models for improving the prediction accuracy. However, a major limitation of previous methods is that the indicators are obtained from only a single source whose reliability might be low, or from several data sources but their interactions and correlations among the multi-sourced data are largely ignored. In this work, we extract the events from Web news and the users' sentiments from social media, and investigate their joint impacts on the stock price movements via a coupled matrix and tensor factorization framework. Specifically, a tensor is firstly constructed to fuse heterogeneous data and capture the intrinsic relations among the events and the investors' sentiments. Due to the sparsity of the tensor, two auxiliary matrices, the stock quantitative feature matrix and the stock correlation matrix, are constructed and incorporated to assist the tensor decomposition. The intuition behind is that stocks that are highly correlated with each other tend to be affected by the same event. Thus, instead of conducting each stock prediction task separately and independently, we predict multiple correlated stocks simultaneously through their commonalities, which are enabled via sharing the collaboratively factorized low rank matrices between matrices and the tensor. Evaluations on the China A-share stock data and the HK stock data in the year 2015 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Despite remarkable success, the state of the art falls short in handling (1) bug reports with diverse characteristics and (2) programs with wildly different behaviors. In response, this paper proposes a graph-based neural model BLoco for automated bug localization. To be specific, our proposed model decomposes bug reports into several bug clues to capture bug-related information from various perspectives for highly diverse bug reports. To understand the program in depth, we first design a code hierarchical network structure, Code-NoN, based on basic blocks to represent source code files. Correspondingly, a multilayer graph neural network is tailored to capture program behaviors from the Code-NoN structure of each source code file. Finally, BLoco further incorporates a bi-affine classifier to comprehensively predict the relationship between the bug reports and source files. Extensive experiments on five large-scale real-world projects demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing techniques.},

	abstract = {Document embedding is a technology that captures informative representations from high-dimensional observations by some structure-preserving maps over corpus and has been intensively explored in machine learning. Recently, some manifold-inspired embedding methods become a hot topic, mainly due to their ability in capturing discriminative embedding. However, the existing methods capture the embeddings based on the geometrical information of nearest neighbors without considering the intrinsic documents-generating structure on a subspace, thus leads to a limitation to uncover intrinsic semantic information. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised local-invariant method, called Discriminative Locally Document Embedding (Disc-LDE), aiming to build a smooth affine map for document embedding by preserving documents-generating structure on a subspace. Disc-LDE models the documents-generating structure as a pseudo-document by a generative probabilistic model of subspace, where the subspace is acquired by a transductive learning of multi-agent random walk on neighborhood graph, and regularizes the training of Auto-Encoders (AEs) to jointly recover the input document and its pseudo-document. Under a general regularized function learning framework, the regularized training can impact the parameterized encoder network become smooth to variations along the documents-generating structure of the local field on manifold. The experimental results on three widely-used corpora demonstrate Disc-LDE could efficient capture the intrinsic semantic structure to improve the clustering and classification performance to the state-of-the-arts methods.},

	abstract = {Social networks play a key role in providing a new approach to collecting information regarding mobility and transportation services. To study this information, sentiment analysis can make decent observations to support intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) in examining traffic control and management systems. However, sentiment analysis faces technical challenges: extracting meaningful information from social network platforms, and the transformation of extracted data into valuable information. In addition, accurate topic modeling and document representation are other challenging tasks in sentiment analysis. We propose an ontology and latent Dirichlet allocation (OLDA)-based topic modeling and word embedding approach for sentiment classification. The proposed system retrieves transportation content from social networks, removes irrelevant content to extract meaningful information, and generates topics and features from extracted data using OLDA. It also represents documents using word embedding techniques, and then employs lexicon-based approaches to enhance the accuracy of the word embedding model. The proposed ontology and the intelligent model are developed using Web Ontology Language and Java, respectively. Machine learning classifiers are used to evaluate the proposed word embedding system. The method achieves accuracy of 93%, which shows that the proposed approach is effective for sentiment classification.},

In this paper, we proposed an interactive attributes attention model that considered all attributes to be relevant and investigated the interactive relationships in and across separate features to improve the sentiment classification performance for customer reviews. In addition to the local text encoder, three more interactive attribute encoders, including user--product, user--text, and product--text encoders, are applied to extract implicit information to align attribute features to text representations with a bilinear interaction instead of self-attention. To better integrate different information, a multiloss objective function is used to further improve the performance. The comparative experiments on the IMDB, Yelp, and Amazon datasets show that the proposed model achieves significant improvements in the effects of the bilinear interactions in and across attributes and local text features.},

	abstract = {Review-based recommendation algorithms can alleviate the data sparsity issue in collaborative filtering by combining user ratings and reviews in model learning. However, most existing methods simplify the feature extraction process from reviews by assuming that different granularities of information (e.g., word, review, and feature) are equally important, which cannot optimally leverage the most important information and thus achieves suboptimal recommendation accuracy. Besides, many existing works directly regard text features as users or items representations, which may not be enough to make precise representations due to the large amount of redundant information in reviews. To tackle the two problems mentioned above, we propose a deep learning-based method named Hierarchical Attention Network Oriented Towards Crowd Intelligence (HANCI). First, HANCI replaces the commonly-used topic models or CNN text processor with an RNN text processor in review feature extraction, which can fully exploit the advantages of the sequential dependencies of reviews by using the whole hidden layers of the bidirectional LSTM as outputs. Second, HANCI weighs the importance of features guided by crowd intelligence to more accurately represent each user on each item, and vice versa. Third, HANCI utilizes a hierarchical attention network based on multi-level review text analysis to extract more precise user preferences and item latent features, so that HANCI can explore the importance of words, the usefulness of reviews and the importance of features to achieve more accurate recommendation. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that HANCI outperforms the state-of-the-art review-based recommendation algorithms in accuracy and meanwhile provides insightful explanations.},

	abstract = {The latest development in cognitive technologies are helping us understand emotions and sentiments with unprecedented precision. Polarity detection is the key enabler to sentiment analysis and typically relies on experimental dictionaries, where terms are assigned polarity scores, yet lacking contextual information and based on human inputs and conventions. In this article, we present a novel approach to automatically extract a polarity dictionary from a particular domain, the stock market, without human intervention and addressing the scaling and thresholding problem. Our approach tracks the price changes of particular stocks over time, using it as a guiding polarity value. The magnitude of the price variation for a particular stock is then attributed to the financial news about this stock in corresponding period of time and that is what we use as our working corpus. On top of that, we derive the so-called binned corpus and apply the well-known TF--IDF information retrieval techniques to compute the TF--IDF value for each term. These values are then disseminated within the neighbourhood of each term based on the embeddings-enabled cosine distance. After introducing the problem and providing the background information, we thoroughly describe our method and all the components required to implement the system. Last but not least, we assign the terms to fuzzy linguistic labels and provide a volatility metric indicating how reliable our scores are depending on their distribution of occurrences in the corpus. To show how our approach works, we implement it for the Euro Stoxx 50 from January 2018 to March 2019 and discuss the results compared with typical approaches, pointing out potential improvements for further research work.},

Moreover, existing models can only detect emotions at either the document-level or the sentence-level.

One of the most intriguing aspects of social networks is to identify influencers who are experts on a specific topic. With the identification of these users within the network, many applications can be built for user recommendation, information diffusion modeling, viral marketing, user modeling and many more. In this paper, we aim to identify topic-based experts using a large dataset collected from Twitter. Our proposed approach has three phases: (1) identification of topics on social media posts (more specifically, tweets), (2) user modeling, based on a group of user specific features, and (3) Influence Factorization to identify topical influencers. The main advantage of the proposed method is to identify future influencers as well as current ones on Twitter. Moreover, it is an easy to implement algorithm using Spark MLlib, which can be easily extended to include other user specific features, and compare with other methodologies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on a large dataset that contains tweets of 180K user over 70 day period. The experimental results show that our proposed method identifies influencers successfully when used with a hybrid user specific feature that contains follower count and authenticity information, and is a highly scalable and extensible algorithm.},

	abstract = {Due to the popularity of social networks, such as microblogs and Twitter, a vast amount of short text data is created every day. Much recent research in short text becomes increasingly significant, such as topic inference for short text. Biterm topic model (BTM) benefits from the word co-occurrence patterns of the corpus, which makes it perform better than conventional topic models in uncovering latent semantic relevance for short text. However, BTM resorts to Gibbs sampling to infer topics, which is very time consuming, especially for large-scale datasets or when the number of topics is extremely large. It requires O(K) operations per sample for K topics, where K denotes the number of topics in the corpus. In this paper, we propose an acceleration algorithm of BTM, FastBTM, using an efficient sampling method for BTM, which converges much faster than BTM without degrading topic quality. FastBTM is based on Metropolis-Hastings and alias method, both of which have been widely adopted in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and achieved outstanding speedup. Our FastBTM can effectively reduce the sampling complexity of biterm topic model from O(K) to O(1) amortized time. We carry out a number of experiments on three datasets including two short text datasets, Tweets2011 Collection dataset and Yahoo! Answers dataset, and one long document dataset, Enron dataset. Our experimental results show that when the number of topics K increases, the gap in running time speed between FastBTM and BTM gets especially larger. In addition, our FastBTM is effective for both short text datasets and long document datasets.},

	abstract = {Effective bug classification and assignment to relevant developers improves the efficiency of software management. However, textually dependent approaches produce inconsistent results on varying datasets, while approaches that depend upon multi-source data can produce dataset conflicts and inaccuracy. Accordingly, we introduce a model based on Self-Paced Association augmentation and Node embedding (SPAN), which uses an effective combination of textually dependent and independent bug categorization to produce consistent results, followed by a bug assignment mechanism to prevent conflicts. To this end, we present a novel unified classifier and assignment model that exploits the connections between nodes in the Software Bug Report Network (SBRNet) to identify the target features. The model is capable of accurately categorizing bugs in a self-paced manner with association augmentation. Finally, we present an approach that assigns the most appropriate developer for bug resolution through SBRNet node information embedding. Our deep two-step self-paced solution is capable of categorizing software bugs with improved accuracy, while still utilizing fewer features. Results reveal that our model is more effective (up to 98% classification accuracy and 96% for bug assignment) when compared to its counterparts.},

	abstract = {Social voting is an emerging new feature in online social platforms, through which users can express their attitudes and opinions towards various interested subjects. Since both social relations and textual content decide the votes propagation, the diverse sources present opportunities and challenges for recommender systems. In this paper, we jointly consider these two factors for the online voting recommendation. First, we conduct feature learning on the vote content. Note that the vote questions are usually short and contain informal expressions, existing text mining methods cannot handle it well. We propose a novel topic-enhanced word embedding (TEWE) method, which learns the word vectors by considering both token-level semantics and document-level mixture topics. Second, we propose two Joint Topic-Semantic-aware Social Matrix Factorization (JTS-MF) models, which fuse social relations and textual content for the vote recommendation. Specifically, JTS-MF1 directly identifies the interaction strength to calculate the similarity among users and votes, while JTS-MF2 aims to preserve inter-user and inter-vote similarities during matrix factorization. Extensive experimental results on real online voting dataset show the effectiveness of our approaches against several state-of-the-art baselines. JTS-MF1 and JTS-MF2 models surpass the matrix factorization based method, with 25.4% and 57.1% improvements in the top-1 recall, and 59.12% and 25.1% improvements in the top-10 recall.},

Existing retrieval-based human-computer conversation systems are intended to reply to user utterances based on existing utterance-response pairs. However, collecting sufficient utterance-response pairs is intractable in practical situations, especially for many specific domains. We introduce DocChat a novel information retrieval approach for human-computer conversation systems that can use unstructured documents rather than semi-structured utterance-response pairs, to react to user utterances. The key of DocChat is a learning to rank model with features designed at various levels of granularity which is proposed to quantify the relevance between utterances and responses directly. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both sentence selection and real human-computer conversation scenarios. Empirical studies of sentence selection datasets shows reasonable improvements and the strong adaptability of our model. We compare DocChat with Xiaoice, a famous open domain chitchat engine in China. Side-by-side evaluation shows that DocChat is a good complement for human-computer conversation systems using utterance-response pairs as the primary source of responses. Furthermore, we release a large scale open-domain dataset for sentence selection which contains 304,413 query-sentence pairs.},

The summary generation is not only relevant with the content of the review itself but should be fully aware of the intrinsic features of the corresponding user and product, i.e., personalization, which are helpful to identify the saliency information in the reviews. Therefore, we propose a Rating-boosted Abstractive Review Summarization with personalized generation (RARS). In our approach, we first propose a neural review-level attention model to effectively learn user preference embedding and product characteristic embedding from their history reviews. Then, we design a personalized decoder to generate the personalized summary, which utilizes the representations of the user and the product to calculate saliency scores for words in the input review to guide the summary generation process. In addition, the rating information can explicitly indicate the sentiment opinion, hence we jointly optimize the summary generation and rating prediction through a multi-task framework, where the two tasks inherently share user preference embedding and product characteristics embedding. Extensive experiments on four datasets show that our model can effectively improve the performance of both review summarization and rating prediction.},

	abstract = {The wide adoption of social networking and microblogging platforms by a large number of users across the globe has provided a rich source of unstructured information for understanding users' behaviors, interests and opinions at both micro and macro levels. An active area in this space is the detection of important real-world events from user-generated social content. The works in this area identify instances of events that impact a large number of users. However, a more nuanced form of an event, known as life event, is also of high importance, which in contrast to real-world events, does not impact a large number of users and is limited to at most a few people. For this reason, life events, such as marriage, travel, and career change, among others, are more difficult to detect for several reasons: i) they are specific to a given user and do not have a wider reaching reflection; ii) they are often not reported directly and need to be inferred from the content posted by individual users; and iii) many users do not report their life events on social platforms, making the problem highly class-imbalanced. In this paper, we propose a semantic approach based on word embedding techniques to model life events. We then use word mover's distance to measure the similarity of a given tweet to different types of life events, which are used as input features for a multi-class classifier. Furthermore, we show that when a sequence of tweets that have appeared before and after a given tweet of interest (temporal stacking) are considered, the performance of the life event detection task improves significantly.},

In recent years, the fast development electronic medical records (EMRs) has provided valuable resources for solving healthcare issues, especially learning and recommending treatments. However, most of the related studies are limited in exploiting various patient information, handling varying-length treatment records, capturing different kinds of treatment patterns and interpreting the recommendation mechanism. This research proposes three methods, one for learning and two for recommending treatments, to overcome the above drawbacks. All methods adopt a mixed-variate restrict Boltzmann machine to represent different kinds of patient records. The treatment learning method captures significant changes in prescription indication to split varying-length records flexibly and organizes sequences of prescription drugs into regimen trees to reveal many more different kinds of treatment patterns. The two treatment recommendation methods illustrate different ideas that can improve the treatment recommendation mechanism by combining the treatments derived from patient groups and neighbor patients. Our experimental evaluation was conducted on three acute disease cohorts extracted from the MIMIC III database. The obtained results show that the proposed methods are able to provide different kinds of treatment patterns and yield competitive efficacy with better interpretability as compared to relevant studies.},

	abstract = {The prediction of event propagation has received extensive attention from the knowledge discovery community for applications such as social network analysis. The data describing these phenomena are multidimensional asynchronous event data that affect each other and show complex dynamic patterns in the continuous-time domain. The study of these dynamic processes and the mining of their potential correlations provide a foundation for the application of event propagation forecasting. However, conventional forecasting methods often make strong assumptions about the generative processes of the event data that may or may not reflect the reality, and the strong parametric assumptions also restrict the expressive power of the respective processes. Therefore, it is difficult to capture both the temporal and spatial effects of past event sequences. Most of the existing methods capture the intensity function of the Hawkes processes conditioned only on the historical events while ignoring the spatial information and the influences among different events. In this work, we propose the Astrologer, a graph neural Hawkes process that can capture the propagation of events from historical events on graph. The underlying idea of Astrologer is to incorporate the conditional intensity function of the Hawkes processes with a graph convolutional recurrent neural network. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that, Astrologer can learn the dynamics of event propagation without knowing the actual parametric forms. Astrologer can also learn the dynamics and achieve better predictive performance than other parametric alternatives based on particular prior assumptions.},

Recently, Knowledge Graphs (KG), i.e., semantic interlinked networks of entities, have been proposed as a new core technology to describe and curate scholarly information with the goal to make it machine readable and understandable. However, the main drawback of the use of such a technology is that researchers are asked to manually annotate their research papers and add their contributions within the KGs. To address this problem, in this paper we propose SCICERO, a novel KG generation approach that takes in input text from research articles and generates a KG of research entities. SCICERO uses Natural Language Processing techniques to parse the content of scientific papers to discover entities and relationships, exploits state-of-the-art Deep Learning Transformer models to make sense and validate extracted information, and uses Semantic Web best practices to formally represent the extracted entities and relationships, making the written content of research papers machine-actionable. SCICERO has been tested on a dataset of 6.7M papers about Computer Science generating a KG of about 10M entities. It has been evaluated on a manually generated gold standard of 3,600 triples that cover three Computer Science subdomains (Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning) obtaining remarkable results.},

Most of the existing methods merely focus on preserving local structural features of vertices, whereas they largely ignore the community patterns and rich attribute information. For example, the title of papers in an academic citation network could imply their research directions, which are potentially valuable in seeking more meaningful representations of these papers. In this paper, we propose a Community-oriented Attributed Network Embedding (COANE) framework, which can smoothly incorporate the community information and text contents of vertices into network embedding. We design a margin-based random walk procedure on the network coupled with flexible margins among communities, which limit the scope of random walks. Inspired by the analogy between vertex sequences and documents, the statistical topic model is adopted to extract community features in the network. Furthermore, COANE integrates textual semantics into representations through the topic model while preserving their structural correlations. Experiments on real-world networks indicate that our proposed method outperforms six state-of-the-art network embedding approaches on network visualization, vertex classification and link prediction.},

Many existing group recommendation systems commonly use aggregation methods, which are insufficient to model group behavior where preference of a user as an individual is often changed when he/she is a member of a group. Some recent methods attempt to reflect this dynamic group behavior. However, they still have limitations in capturing complex relationships between items and group members. Moreover, previous approaches do not fully utilize useful context information available, and only use rating data. Reflecting context information together with ratings helps resolve a well-known data sparsity problem in group recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel group recommendation framework called Dynamic Group behavior modeling that utilizes Context information for group recommendation(DGC). In DGC, we newly develop dynamic group behavior modeling that enables summarization of complex patterns in group decision making processes. To apply context information, firstly, we extract relevant context information from a heterogeneous information network (HIN) that contains rich information between various entities. Then, context information is properly applied to a group recommendation model by using semi-supervised learning that is composed of a supervised loss for label prediction and an unsupervised loss for context prediction. Experimental results show that our method provides significant performance improvement over other existing methods.},

To seek a solution to this, we have two main research questions: (1) Which factors are vital for a sentiment classifier? (2) How will these factors interact with dataset characteristics? Regarding the first question, harmonious combination of location attention and content attention may be crucial to alleviate semantic mismatch problem between aspect terms and opinion words. However, location attention does not reflect the fact that critical opinion words usually come left or right of corresponding aspect terms, as implied in the target-dependent method although not well elucidated before. Besides, content attention needs to be sophisticated to combine multiple attention outcomes nonlinearly and consider the entire context to address complicated sentences. We merge all these significant factors for the first time, and design two models differing a little in the implementation of a few factors. Concerning the second question, we suggest a new multifaceted view on the dataset beyond the current tendency to be somewhat indifferent to the dataset in pursuit of a universal best performer. We then observe the interaction between factors of model architecture and dimensions of dataset characteristics. Experimental results show that our models achieve state-of-the-art or comparable performances and that there exist some useful relationships such as superior performance of bi-directional LSTM over one-directional LSTM for sentences containing multiple aspects and vice versa for sentences containing only one aspect.},

	abstract = {In Community Question Answering (CQA) websites, expert finding aims to seek relevant experts for answering questions. The core of expert finding is to match candidate experts and target questions precisely. Most existing methods usually learn a single feature vector for the expert from the historically answered questions, and then match the target question, which would lose fine-grained and low-level semantic matching information. In this paper, instead of matching with a unified expert embedding, we propose an expert finding method with a multi-grained hierarchical matching framework, named EFHM. Specifically, we design a word-level and question-level match encoder to learn the fine-grained semantic matching between each historical answered question and target question, and then propose an expert-level match encoder to learn an overall expert feature for matching the target question. Through the hierarchical matching mechanism, our model has the potential to capture the comprehensive relevance between candidate experts and target questions. Experimental results on six real-world CQA datasets demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {The popularity of online forums provides a good opportunity to learn user interests which can be used in many business scenarios, such as product or news recommendation. There exist many approaches to infer forum topics and users' interests. Among them, Author-Topic (AT) like models are most popular. But a thread in online forum is composed of a root post and some response posts which may be relevant or irrelevant to the root post. So the assumption of AT that response posts are generated from user's interest topics is not comprehensive. In this paper, we distinguish user's serious and unserious interest topics and argue that the topic of a relevant response post is jointly determined by its author's serious interest topics and the topics of its root post, while the topic of irrelevant response post is only determined by its author's unserious interest topics. Based on these assumptions, we propose Forum-LDA to model the generative process of root post, relevant and irrelevant response posts jointly. Therefore, our model can not only learn more coherent topics and serious interests, but also identify unserious users who publish many irrelevant posts. Extensive experiments on real forum dataset demonstrate the advantages of our model in tasks such as user interest and unserious user discovery.},

This has fetched a lot of attention from various researchers and marketers all over the world. Major portion of the studies done in the field of information diffusion through social networks has focused on the problem of influence maximization. These methods demand the diffusion probabilities associated with the links in the social networks to be provided as inputs. However, the problem of computing these diffusion probabilities has not been as widely explored as the problem of influence maximization. In this paper, we tackle the problem of predicting the probabilities of diffusion of a message through the links of a social network. This paper presents a Bayesian network based approach for solving the aforesaid problem. In addition to the features related to the social network, this machine learning based Bayesian framework utilizes user interests and content similarity modeled using the latent topic information. We evaluate the proposed method using the data obtained from the well-known social network platform - Twitter.},

Traditional approaches to document representation may suffer from the disregard of the correlations or order of words in a document, due to unrealistic assumption of word independence or exchangeability. Recently, long--short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural networks have been shown effective in preserving local contextual sequential patterns of words in a document, but using the LSTM model alone may not be adequate to capture global topical semantics for learning document representation. In this work, we propose a new topic-enhanced LSTM model to deal with the document representation problem. We first employ an attention-based LSTM model to generate hidden representation of word sequence in a given document. Then, we introduce a latent topic modeling layer with similarity constraint on the local hidden representation, and build a tree-structured LSTM on top of the topic layer for generating semantic representation of the document. We evaluate our model in typical text mining applications, i.e., document classification, topic detection, information retrieval, and document clustering. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the benefit of our innovations over state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

Techniques for aspect extraction can produce an undesirably large number of aspects --- with many of those relating to the same product feature. Hence, aspect clustering becomes necessary. Current solutions for aspect clustering are monolingual, but in many practical situations, reviews for a given entity are available in several languages, calling for multilingual integration. In this article, we address the novel task of multilingual aspect clustering, which aims at grouping semantically related aspects extracted from reviews written in several languages. Our method is unsupervised and relies on the contextual information of the aspects, which is represented by word embeddings. This representation allied with a suitable similarity measure allows clustering related aspects. Our experiments on two datasets with five languages each showed that our unsupervised clustering technique achieves results that outperform monolingual baselines adapted to work with multilingual data. We also show the benefits of the multilingual approach compared to using languages in isolation.},

	abstract = {Text classification is an important and classical problem in natural language processing. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in text classification and achieved outstanding performance. Despite the success of GNNs on text classification, existing methods are still limited in two main aspects. On the one hand, transductive methods cannot easily adapt to new documents. Since transductive methods incorporate all documents into their text graph, they need to reconstruct the whole graph and retrain their system from scratch when new documents come. However, this is not applicable to real-world situations. On the other hand, many state-of-the-art algorithms ignore the quality of text graphs, which may lead to sub-optimal performance. To address these problems, we propose a Graph Fusion Network (GFN), which can overcome these limitations and boost text classification performance. In detail, in the graph construction stage, we build homogeneous text graphs with word nodes, which makes the learning system capable of making inference on new documents without rebuilding the whole text graph. Then, we propose to transform external knowledge into structural information and integrate different views of text graphs to capture more structural information. In the graph reasoning stage, we divide the process into three steps: graph learning, graph convolution, and graph fusion. In the graph learning step, we adopt a graph learning layer to further adapt text graphs. In the graph fusion step, we design a multi-head fusion module to integrate different opinions. Experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.},

With the explosive growth of online news, there is a need for event detection to facilitate better navigation for users in news spaces. Existing works usually represent documents based on TF-IDF scheme and use a clustering algorithm for event detection. However, traditional TF-IDF vector representation suffers problems of high dimension and sparse semantics. In addition, with more news documents coming, IDF need to be incrementally updated. In this paper, we present a novel document representation method based on word embeddings, which reduces the dimension and alleviates the sparse semantics compared to TF-IDF, and thus improves the efficiency and accuracy. Based on the document representation, we propose an adaptive online clustering method for online news event detection, which improves both the precision and recall by using time slicing and event merging respectively. The resulted events are further improved by an adaptive post-processing step which can automatically detect noisy events and further process them. Experiments on standard and real-world datasets show that our proposed adaptive online event detection method significantly improves the performance of event detection in terms of both efficiency and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Travel recommendation is very critical to helping users quickly find products or services that they are interested in. The key to travel recommender systems is learning user shopping intentions, which are expressed through various supervision signals, such as the clicked products and their titles. Existing travel recommendation methods commonly infer user intentions from click behaviors on travel products. However, remarkable keywords in the product title, such as departure, destination, travel time, hotel, and transportation are paid less attention. To this end, we hypothesize that modeling click sequences and product keywords in title jointly would result in a more holistic representation of a product and towards more accurate recommendations. Thus, we propose a TRKG (short for Travel Recommendation with Keywords Generation) model, which fulfills the travel recommendation and keywords generation tasks simultaneously. To generate explainable outputs, unlike most previous approaches that regard the product title as a hidden feature vector, TRKG regards keywords in the product title as an additional supervision signal. Meanwhile, TRKG integrates the long-term and short-term user preferences in the travel recommendation component and the keywords generation component. To evaluate the proposed model, we constructed datasets from a large tourism e-commerce website in China. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.},

The challenges of the task include little context for mentions in questions, lack of ground truth for learning, and language gaps between CQA and knowledge bases. To overcome these problems, we propose a topic modelling approach to NED for questions. Our model performs learning in an unsupervised manner, but can take advantage of weak supervision signals estimated from the metadata of CQA and knowledge bases. The signals can enrich the context of mentions in questions, and bridge the language gaps between CQA and knowledge bases. Besides these advantages, our model simulates people's behavior in CQA and thus is intuitively interpretable. We conduct experiments on both Chinese and English CQA data.

Due to its simply modeling of user--item interactions by inner product of two vectors as a linear model, its efficiency needs an improvement. Neural Network-based matrix factorization has been proposed to deal with this issues. Usually, these methods are proposed on clean data, but in real applications, there are possibly unexpected noises and outliers, due to many subjective or objective reasons. The noisy instances would disturb the learning of normal instances and thus cause adverse affect as the model would also be easily over-fitted. Thus, we propose an enhanced neural matrix factorization model by introducing a self-paced learning (SPL) schema, which can automatically distinguish noisy instances and learn the model mostly based on clean instances. The main contribution of our model is that we design a bounded SPL learning schema with a parameter to control how many instances will be finally induced in the model learning. Thus, different from traditional SPL that gradually selects instances until all are selected, the bounded SPL mechanism tries to learn the model mainly on clean data and exclude noisy instances. The effectiveness of proposed method on collaborative filtering is demonstrated by extensive experiments on three widely used datasets.},

As online scholarly resources have become widespread in recent years, better keyphrase extraction techniques are required to improve search efficiency. We present two features, keyphrase semantic diversity and keyphrase coverage, to overcome limitations of existing methods for unsupervised keyphrase extraction. Keyphrase semantic diversity is the degree of semantic variety in the extraction result, which is introduced to avoid extracting synonym phrases that contain the same high-score candidate. Keyphrase coverage refers to candidates' representativeness of other words in documents. We propose an unsupervised keyphrase extraction method called TripleRank, which evaluates three features: word position (a sensitive feature for academic documents) and two innovative features mentioned above. The architecture of TripleRank includes three sub-models that score the three features and a summing model. Though involving multiple models, there is no typical iteration process in TripleRank; hence, the computational cost is relatively low. TripleRank has led the experiment results on four academic datasets compared to four state-of-the-art baseline models, which confirmed the influence of keyphrase semantic diversity and keyphrase coverage and proved the efficiency of our method.},

These data denote real-world events from multiple dimensions simultaneously so that they can provide comprehensive and complementary understanding of social event. In recent years, multi-modal social event detection has attracted intensive attentions. This paper concentrates on conducting a comprehensive survey of extant works. Two current attempts in this field are firstly reviewed: event feature learning and event inference. Particularly, event feature learning is a pre-requisite because of its ability on translating social media data into computer-friendly numerical form. Event inference aims at deciding whether a sample belongs to a social event. Then, several public datasets in the community are introduced and the comparison results are also provided. At the end of this paper, a general discussion of the insights is delivered to promote the development of multi-modal social event detection.},

	abstract = {Aspect term extraction (ATE) and opinion target extraction (OTE) are two important tasks in fine-grained sentiment analysis field. Existing approaches to ATE and OTE are mainly based on rules or machine learning methods. Rule-based methods are usually unsupervised, but they can't make use of high level features. Although supervised learning approaches usually outperform the rule-based ones, they need a large number of labeled samples to train their models, which are expensive and time-consuming to annotate. In this paper, we propose a hybrid unsupervised method which can combine rules and machine learning methods to address ATE and OTE tasks. First, we use chunk-level linguistic rules to extract nominal phrase chunks and regard them as candidate opinion targets and aspects. Then we propose to filter irrelevant candidates based on domain correlation. Finally, we use these texts with extracted chunks as pseudo labeled data to train a deep gated recurrent unit (GRU) network for aspect term extraction and opinion target extraction. The experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in extracting opinion targets and aspects with minimal manual annotation.},

	abstract = {Learning topics from short texts has become a critical and fundamental task for understanding the widely-spread streaming social messages, e.g., tweets, snippets and questions/answers. Up to date, there are two distinctive topic learning schemes: generative probabilistic graphical models and geometrically linear algebra approaches, with LDA and NMF being the representative works, respectively. Since these two methods both could uncover the latent topics hidden in the unstructured short texts, some interesting doubts are coming to our minds that which one is better and why? Are there any other more effective extensions? In order to explore valuable insights between LDA and NMF based learning schemes, we comprehensively conduct a series of experiments into two parts. Specifically, the basic LDA and NMF are compared with different experimental settings on several public short text datasets in the first part which would exhibit that NMF tends to perform better than LDA; in the second part, we propose a novel model called ``Knowledge-guided Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Better Short Text Topic Mining'' (abbreviated as KGNMF), which leverages external knowledge as a semantic regulator with low-rank formalizations, yielding up a time-efficient algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on three representative corpora with currently typical short text topic models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed KGNMF. Overall, learning with NMF-based schemes is another effective manner in short text topic mining in addition to the popular LDA-based paradigms.},

Recently, multi-view learning via probabilistic latent semantic analysis (MVPLSA), is also designed for multi-view topic modeling. These approaches are instances of generative model, whereas they all ignore the manifold structure of data distribution, which is generally useful for preserving the nonlinear information. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple graph regularized generative model to exploit the manifold structure in multiple views. Specifically, we construct a nearest neighbor graph for each view to encode its corresponding manifold information. A multiple graph ensemble regularization framework is proposed to learn the optimal intrinsic manifold. Then, the manifold regularization term is incorporated into a multi-view topic model, resulting in a unified objective function. The solutions are derived based on the Expectation Maximization optimization framework. Experimental results on real-world multi-view data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

In this work, we focus on the interpretability of venue representations, an essential property that existing methods fail to provide. We propose two novel models to generate interpretable and easy-to-understand venue representations. The first model, CEM, is a category-aware (a category may be a restaurant, a mall, etc.) check-in embedding model and generates venue and category representations by capturing the sequential patterns of check-in records. With the second model, XEM, each dimension of the venue representation corresponds to a semantic anchor (i.e., a category) and can be interpreted as a coherent topic. We conduct extensive experiments using real-world check-in datasets for venue similarity computation and venue semantic annotation, and empirically show that introducing interpretability to the venue representations improves the performance of various downstream tasks.},

	abstract = {Identifying the trending topics in journals and conferences is valuable for understanding the role of authors, institutions, and funding agencies in the progression of knowledge produced in the field. However, many available clustering methods do not accommodate a desire for temporally clustered results that are typical of trends, in part because time of publication is often neglected as a feature. As a demonstration of how time can be emphasized in trend detection, we use a novel approach of introducing a weighted temporal feature to bias a topic clustering toward articles in a similar time frame; this is performed over a set of finance journal abstracts from 1974 to 2020. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to parameterize each abstract, followed by dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). We detect trending finance topics that are not identifiable when we use a standard clustering approach with no temporal bias. To identify trending topics, we utilize a metric of the silhouette score divided by the standard deviation of clusters over time. We then isolate topics identified by this metric and validate them using expert judgment. Our clustering strategy using temporal bias can be readily utilized in other fields for discovering the rise and fall of trends.},

	abstract = {Topic model is a hot research topic which is attracting attentions from many fields. Recently, several studies have applied topic model to ASR (audio scene recognition). Among these studies, most of them use the document-word co-occurrence matrix for topic analysis. In this work, we propose a new ASR algorithm based on audio events and topic model, which uses the document-event co-occurrence matrix for topic analysis. Our work is based on the hypothesis that: for an audio document, compared with its word distribution, its event distribution is more in line with humans' way of thinking, and then the topic distribution obtained based on the document-event co-occurrence matrix can represent the audio document better. The contribution of this work lies in that: (1) we propose an ASR algorithm which uses document-event co-occurrence matrix for topic analysis. Compared with the current studies which use document-word co-occurrence matrix for topic analysis, the proposed algorithm can extract the topic distribution which can express the audio documents better, and then can get better recognition results; (2) we propose a much easier method to obtain the document-event co-occurrence matrix; (3) we propose a method to weight the event distribution of audio documents; this weighting method can emphasize the audio events that are important in reflecting the unique topics of the audio documents, and can suppress the audio events that are common to many topics. Experimental results on two public datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed ASR algorithm, and also verify the necessity and effectiveness of the proposed weighting method. The innovative ideas in this work are not limited to ASR, but can be extended to many other fields, such as the video classification etc.},

The three modules have been validated using state-of-the-art benchmark datasets, exhibiting good performance in all of them. Besides, FacTeR-Check is employed to collect and label a dataset, called NLI19-SP, composed of more than 40,000 tweets supporting or denying 60 hoaxes related to COVID-19, released publicly. Finally, an analysis of the data collected in this dataset is provided, which allows to obtain a deep insight of how disinformation operated during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spanish-speaking countries.},

	abstract = {Attributed graph clustering is an important task for grouping the nodes in a graph. In recent years, the algorithms based on graph convolutional networks (GCN) have achieved promising performance. However, almost all existing methods ignore that the nonlinearity between two consecutive GCN layers is unnecessary for improving the performance of attributed graph clustering, and may even harm the efficiency of the model. In this paper, we propose a novel deep linear graph attention model for attributed graph clustering (DLGAMC), which consists of an attention-based aggregation module and a similarity preserve module. Specifically, we simply exploit cosine similarity to construct the attention for aggregation, which does not need to learn extra attention parameters. It is worth noting that the attention we designed not only explicitly considers the similarity of attribute information, but also implicitly takes into account the local graph structure. To select the proper order of aggregation, we propose an adaptive strategy to evaluate the smoothness of node representations, where intra-cluster distance and inter-cluster distance are the key indicators in this process. To learn node representations for clustering, we design a similarity preserve module to preserve local similarity and global dissimilarity of the smooth features obtained by multiple aggregations, which is different from the ideas in reconstruction-based methods. Finally, k-means is performed on the learned representations to obtain the cluster partition. Experiments on several datasets show that our algorithm achieves great performance in attributed graph clustering tasks.},

	abstract = {Consumption of content in short-text microblogs is necessitated to a large extent by individual users and their friendship network interests. Based on the dynamism in the data throughput on such platforms, e.g., Twitter, prevailing conditions are bound to determine the nature of consumed or disseminated content. Therefore, semantic interests differ over time even for individual users. Detecting this semantic change over time is integral in mapping user profiles over a time period, especially in microblogs where only the extrinsic user profile identifiers provide metadata that seldom evolve. This is vital in serving relevant third-party content as well as in the computation of topical interest variations over time. In essence, current, and relevant topics of interest to a user on such a platform may not be representative of the same users' interests a few months later. In our quest to identify the most user-representative interests at any given time, each topical term was modelled as the inner product between word embeddings and a time-based embedding representation of assigned topics at varied time periods. The model was fitted onto tweets as time-series documents. To validate the model, changes in the extracted user-representative interests over time were semantically weighed against a mirrored, time-variant dataset. Interest weights across the time-variant datasets were computed and validated in five sub-topics for a period spanning two and a half years. Linearity in the relationships between the test and validation sets could be identified, more so in emerging topics. A Pearson correlation coefficient as high as 0.871 was achieved in interest change verification over the tested period.},

Existing studies have mainly adopted the categorical lexicons that are tagged by predefined emotion taxonomies to link affective words with discrete emotions. However, in these lexicons, emotion tags are restricted to a specific set of basic emotions. Moreover, the emotional intensity is ignored, making these methods less flexible and less informative. This paper proposes a novel method to generate a word-level emotion distribution (WED) vector by incorporating domain knowledge and dimensional lexicon. The proposed method can link a word with more generic and fine-grained emotion taxonomies with quantitatively computed intensities. We propose two schemas to utilize the WED vector implicitly and explicitly to facilitate classification. The implicit approach implements a rule-based conversion strategy to augment the information in the label space. The explicit approach exploits WED as an emotional word embedding to enhance the sentiment feature. We conduct extensive experiments on seven multiclass datasets. The results indicate that both proposed schemas produce competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Document clustering is a powerful method with numerous applications, where the core idea is to group text into smaller and more manageable pieces of semantically related information. While there has been progress in the research community on improving the quality of clusters, the extraction of information that explains the semantic content of the clusters is still mostly a manual activity, as it requires the inspection of sample documents. In this work, we propose three main cluster explanation approaches that extend the current state of the art, which is mostly based on predicting a label for each cluster (i.e. cluster labelling). The first approach is based on scores extracted from the word distributions; the second is based on augmenting the score-based explanations using external knowledge-bases, and the third one combines the first two methods to exploit the knowledge coming from a labelled dataset. We also discuss the limitations of the current metric presented in the literature and extend it to evaluate our approaches using ground truth. We also provided an extensive set of evaluations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, by running multiple experiments to compare our approaches with different baselines. Results indicate that improved explanations are possible and that linking external knowledge can provide more general cluster descriptions. Semi-supervised approaches also demonstrated meaningful insight. User studies were also conducted highlighting that users prefer specialized explanations.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, social network sites (SNSs) have been significant platforms for content sharing in our daily life. With the emergence of different kinds of social network sites and users' diverse needs for content sharing, their content sharing practices are generally taken place in multiple SNSs. To construct models that can characterize users' content sharing practices in a composite context constituted by multiple social network sites (cross-site user generated content modeling) has been an emerging research topic in web data mining and human behavior research. However, previous methods such as Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture model (DMM), Biterm Topic Model (BTM), Twitter-LDA and MultiLDA have limited representation ability or are based on unreliable assumption, which cannot characterize the user generated content (UGC) accurately from the perspective of multiple SNSs. In this paper, we first conduct an empirical study to investigate the characteristics of users' content sharing practices in cross-site context, based on which we propose a more reliable cross-site UGC model named CrossSite-LDA (C-LDA). We then evaluate the performances of the C-LDA model with four state-of-the-art models based on the two data sets sampled from Weibo--Douban and Facebook--Twitter. Results show that the C-LDA has better performances in perplexity, word coherence, topic KL divergence, UCI and UMass metrics compared with existing models, which suggests its superior accuracy on modeling users' content characteristics in cross-site context.},

	abstract = {Users of Community Question Answering (CQA) could not manage their time conveniently because their questions are often not answered quickly enough. To address this problem, we try to provide a function for CQA sites to inform users when their questions will be answered. In this paper, we propose a Question--Answerer Model Matching based answerer's response time prediction named (QAM2), which consists of two parts: the construction of the Multi-feature based Question--Answerer Model (MQAM, including the answerer model and the question model) and the prediction of question response time based on MQAM Matching Strategy (QAMMS). Firstly, the MQAM is built according to some extracted deep features (e.g., answerer's interest, professional level, activity, question category and difficulty), which are neglected in most existing methods on the prediction of question response time. Herein, the Label Cluster Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LC-LDA) model was proposed to overcome the compulsive allocation behaviors caused by traditional topic models (e.g. LDA), which treats the words that are irrelevant or weakly related to the subject as the topic of short texts when extracting the feature of answerer's interest and question category. Meanwhile, an improved PageRank algorithm-topic sensitive weighted PageRank (TSWPR) is used to eliminate the impact of ``indiscriminate'' users who have answered many questions with low quality of answers. Secondly, we use the model matching strategy based on multiple classifier for matching MQAM and calculating the question response time of each answerer. Experiments conducted on two real data sets of Stack Overflow show that the proposed method can improve significantly the accuracy of question response time prediction in CQA.},

Existing Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based keyphrase generation approaches cannot properly model the dependency structure of the informal text, which is often implicit between those distant words and plays an important role in extracting salient information. To obtain core features of text, we apply Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) on document-level graph to capture dependency structure information. The GCN-based node representations are further fed into a predictor network to provide potential candidates for copying mechanism. Moreover, we utilize a novel variational selector network to determine the final selection probability of each word in a phrase, which relies on its probabilities of copying from a given document and being generated from a vocabulary. Eventually, we introduce an enhancement mechanism to maximize the mutual information between document and generated keyphrase, thus ensuring the consistency between them.

	abstract = {Because of its efficiency, word embedding has been widely used in many natural language processing and text modeling tasks. It aims to represent each word by a vector so such that the geometry between these vectors can capture the semantic correlations between words. An ambiguous word can often have diverse meanings in different contexts, a quality which is called polysemy. The bulk of studies aimed to generate only one single embedding for each word, whereas a few studies have made a small number of embeddings to present different meanings of each word. However, it is hard to determine the exact number of senses for each word, as meanings depend on contexts. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel adaptive cross-contextual word embedding (ACWE) method for capturing the word polysemy in different contexts based on topic modeling, in which the word polysemy is defined over a latent interpretable semantic space. The proposed ACWE consists of two main parts, in the first of which an unsupervised cross-contextual probabilistic word embedding model is designed to obtain the global word embeddings, and each word is represented by an embedding in the unified latent semantic space. Based on the global word embeddings, an adaptive cross-contextual word embedding process is then devised in the second part to learn the local embeddings for each polysemous word in different contexts. In fact, a word embedding is adaptively adjusted and updated with respect to different contexts to generate different word embeddings tailored to the corresponding contexts. The proposed ACWE is validated on two datasets collected from Wikipedia and IMDb on different tasks including word similarity, polysemy induction, semantic interpretability, and text classification. Experimental results indicate that ACWE does not only outperform the established word embedding methods, which consider word polysemy on six popular benchmark datasets, but it also yields competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches without considering polysemy. Moreover, the proposed ACWE significantly improves the performances of text classification both in precision and F1, and the visualizations of the semantics of words demonstrate the feasibility and advantage of the proposed ACWE model on polysemy.},

	abstract = {Emotion distribution learning aims to annotate unlabeled instances with a set of emotion categories and their strengths. Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (NMTF) introduces an association matrix between document clusters and word clusters to help the domain adaptation task in emotion distribution learning. Nevertheless, many prior cross-domain emotion distribution learning methods had two major deficiencies. First, they hypothesize that there is a one-to-one correspondence between document clusters and emotion labels. In their experiments, the number of document clusters depends on the number of labels. Second, the prior work does not endow models with adequate constraints. In the real scenario of cross-domain emotion distribution learning, there are potential constraints that may improve the performance of such models. In order to address these problems, we propose a constrained optimization approach based on NMTF for cross-domain emotion distribution learning. In our model, the relationship between document clusters and emotion labels is not always one-to-one. A novel content-based constraint is also endowed based on the hypothesis that documents belonging to the same clusters must have similar content. We solve the optimization problem by an alternately iterative algorithm and show the proof of convergence. Experiments on 12 real-world cross-domain emotion distribution learning tasks validate the effectiveness of our method.},

Although most existing multi-label feature selection approaches can deal with the problem of label ambiguity which mainly focuses on the assumption of uniform distribution with logical labels, it cannot be applied to many practical applications where the significance of related label for every instance tends to be different. To deal with this issue, in this study, label distribution learning covered with a certain real number of labels is introduced to design a model for the labeling-significance. Nevertheless, multi-label feature selection is limited to handling only labels consisting of logical relations. In order to solve this problem, combining the random variable distribution with granular computing, we first propose a label enhancement algorithm to transform logical labels in multi-label data into label distribution with more supervised information, which can mine the hidden label significance from every instance. On this basis, to remove some redundant or irrelevant features in multi-label data, a label distribution feature selection algorithm using mutual information and label enhancement is developed. Finally, the experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to the other state-of-the-art approaches when dealing with multi-label data.},

Existing research on emotion analysis has focused mostly on detecting types of emotions, and has solved problems using classification-based methods. Recently, fine-grained emotion analysis has attracted the attention of researchers for probing the essential elements of emotions, such as the causes, experiencers and results of emotion events, which could help further elucidate textual emotions in more depth. In this paper, we focus on the task of emotion cause extraction, aiming to recognize the causes in sentences that provoke certain emotions. We propose a two-stage supervised ranking method for accurately extracting the emotion causes based on information retrieval techniques. In the first stage, we measure the complexity of provoked emotions using query performance predictors to distinguish the number of causes for each emotion in contexts. In the second stage, we incorporate the emotion complexity into learning an autoencoder-enhanced ranking model for accurately extracting the causal clauses. We also extract abundant emotion-level clause features for clause representations as the learning samples. We evaluate the proposed method on an existing dataset for emotion cause extraction and demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods. The proposed method is effective in extracting textual emotion causes in sentences, which can greatly benefit in-depth emotion analysis for effective cognitive computing.},

	abstract = {Text representation, a crucial step for text mining and natural language processing, concerns about transforming unstructured textual data into structured numerical vectors to support various machine learning and data mining algorithms. For document classification, one classical and commonly adopted text representation method is Bag-of-Words (BoW) model. BoW represents document as a fixed-length vector of terms, where each term dimension is a numerical value such as term frequency or tf-idf weight. However, BoW simply looks at surface form of words. It ignores the semantic, conceptual and contextual information of texts, and also suffers from high dimensionality and sparsity issues. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel document representation scheme called Bag-of-Concepts (BoC), which automatically acquires useful conceptual knowledge from external knowledge base, then conceptualizes words and phrases in the document into higher level semantics (i.e. concepts) in a probabilistic manner, and eventually represents a document as a distributed vector in the learned concept space. By utilizing background knowledge from knowledge base, BoC representation is able to provide more semantic and conceptual information of texts, as well as better interpretability for human understanding. We also propose Bag-of-Concept-Clusters (BoCCl) model which clusters semantically similar concepts together and performs entity sense disambiguation to further improve BoC representation. In addition, we combine BoCCl and BoW representations using an attention mechanism to effectively utilize both concept-level and word-level information and achieve optimal performance for document classification.},

Moreover, the increase in the volume of information on the Internet through blogs and web news has made the detection process difficult, which has created a need for automation. Recent studies have attempted topic modeling techniques, specifically latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), for automating the weak signal detection process; however, these approaches do not cover all parts of the process. In this study, we propose a fully automatic LDA-based weak signal detection method, consisting of two filtering functions: the weakness function aimed at filtering topics, which potentially contains weak signals, and the potential warning function, which helps to extract only early warning signs from the previously filtered topics. We took this approach with a famous daily web news dataset, and we could detect the risk of the COVID19 pandemic at an early stage.},

DLRA can trigger initial recommendation and improve the quality of recommendations by using the duality characteristics of RSs, even when the available labeled information is scarce. Specifically, DLRA regards the recommendation task as two independent subtasks --- primal task and dual task, and these two tasks show strong duality in DLRA. The primal task is item-centered which aims to find users who can rate high for items, while the dual task is user-centered that aims to recommend the most favorite items to users. These two tasks have strong dualities in terms of the recommendation space, selection probability and recommendation basis. Based on these dualities, we design three dual learning strategies to couple the whole recommendation process and realize the self-tuning and self-improvement of each task model, and finally optimize the whole recommendation model. Based on the dataset of Movielens and BookCrossing, we simulate data sparsity and cold start recommendation scenarios, the experimental results show that DLRA achieves substantial improvement when the labeled data is scare, and it outperforms other hybrid recommendation approaches and deep learning strategies with a smaller predictive error as well as better recommendation accuracy.},

	abstract = {The journal Knowledge-based Systems (KnoSys) has been published for over 25 years, during which time its main foci have been extended to a broad range of studies in computer science and artificial intelligence. Answering the questions: ``What is the KnoSys community interested in?'' and ``How does such interest change over time?'' are important to both the editorial board and audience of KnoSys. This paper conducts a topic-based bibliometric study to detect and predict the topic changes of KnoSys from 1991 to 2016. A Latent Dirichlet Allocation model is used to profile the hotspots of KnoSys and predict possible future trends from a probabilistic perspective. A model of scientific evolutionary pathways applies a learning-based process to detect the topic changes of KnoSys in sequential time slices. Six main research areas of KnoSys are identified, i.e., expert systems, machine learning, data mining, decision making, optimization, and fuzzy, and the results also indicate that the interest of KnoSys communities in the area of computational intelligence is raised, and the ability to construct practical systems through knowledge use and accurate prediction models is highly emphasized. Such empirical insights can be used as a guide for KnoSys submissions.},

To make the video to be attractive, embedding appropriate background music into the video is a popular way to enrich user experience, but it is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task to find music that fits the video. This work proposes to use latent factors to recommend a list of music songs for a given video, in which the recommendation is based on the proposed score function, which involves the weighted average of the latent factors for the video and music. Moreover, we use pairwise ranking to design the objective function, and use stochastic gradient descent to optimize the proposed objective function. In the experiments, we specify two hypotheses and design several experiments to assess the performance and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm from different aspects, including accuracy, quantitative research, and qualitative research. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model is promising in accuracy and quantitative research. Furthermore, this work provides detailed analysis to investigate the fitness of the background music that recommended by the system through interviewing the subjects.},

	abstract = {In many fields, how to catch the related-topic Web resources is crucial. As a vertical search method, focused crawler has received great attention in recent years. Currently, most focused crawlers consider multiple evaluating factors of the hyperlinks and use the weighted sum approach to compute the priorities of unvisited hyperlinks. However, the proper weighted coefficients are hard to determine, and their unsuitable values may even cause the direction of crawlers to deviate seriously from the topic. To overcome this issue, this article builds a multi-objective optimization model based on Web text and link structure and designs a crawler framework called the Web space evolution (WSE), where a hyperlink bank whose radius is gradually increased is introduced to extend the search scape of crawlers in Web space. To improve the uniformity and diversity of hyperlinks, a nearest and farthest candidate solution method is combined with the fast non-dominated sorting to choose Pareto-optimal solutions (hyperlinks). A domain ontology based on the formal concept analysis is applied to establish the topic model. By incorporating the WSE and the domain ontology into the focused crawling, a novel focused crawler called FCWSEO is proposed to collect topic-relevant webpages. The experimental results on the rainstorm disaster domain show that the FCWSEO outperforms other focused crawler strategies in terms of the quantity and quality of retrieved relevant webpages.},

	abstract = {Aspect-level sentiment classification aims to predict the sentiment of a text in different aspects and it is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task. Recent work exploits an Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory Network to perform aspect-level sentiment classification. Most previous work are based on supervised learning that needs a large number of labeled samples, but the problem is that only a limited subset of data samples are labeled in practical applications. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Aspect Level Sentiment Classification Model based on Variational Autoencoder (AL-SSVAE) for semi-supervised learning in the aspect-level sentiment classification. The AL-SSVAE model inputs a given aspect to an encoder a decoder based on a variational autoencoder (VAE), and it also has an aspect level sentiment classifier. It enables the attention mechanism to deal with different parts of a text when different aspects are taken as input as previous methods. Due to that the sentiment polarity of a word is usually sensitive to the given aspect, a single vector for a word is problematic. Therefore, we propose the aspect-specific word embedding learning from a topical word embeddings model to express a word and also append the corresponding sentiment vector into the word input vector. We compare our AL-SSVAE model with several recent aspect-level sentiment classification models on the SemEval 2016 dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model is able to capture more accurate semantics and sentiment for the given aspect and obtain better performance on the task of the aspect level sentiment classification. Moreover, the AL-SSVAE model is able to learn with the semi-supervised mode in the aspect level sentiment classification, which enables it to learn efficiently using less labeled data.},

Most existing hyperbolic embedding models map to learn the representation vectors while preserving the microscopic adjacency, which cannot accurately represent the mesoscopic community structures. To this end, this study proposes a Community Preserving Hyperbolic Embedding model (CPHE). Specifically, we regularize the likelihood function of hyperbolic embedding by adding to the community co-occurrence relation (CCR). We then construct a closed loop for node embedding and community detection. Thus, the representation vectors and CCR alternately update. Finally, to avoid the distortion of the representing community, an equivalent majorization based on the sum of linear ratios programming is achieved for the numerical solution. Application experiments are implemented on both synthetic and real-world networks to evaluate the embedding performance. The accuracy and normalized mutual information (NMI) of community detection improved by approximately 3% and 2.4%, respectively, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of link prediction improved by approximately 1.3%, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed model.},

HIN that associated with various attributes on nodes is defined as attributed HIN (or AHIN). Clustering is a fundamental task for HIN and AHIN. However, most of the current existing methods focus on single type nodes and there is very limited existing work that groups objects of different types into the same cluster. This is largely due to the reasons that object similarities can either be attribute-based or link-based between same type of nodes and it is challenging to incorporate both in a unified framework. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a framework, namely Cross Multi-Type Objects Clustering in Attributed Heterogeneous Information Network, or CMOC-AHIN, to integrate both the attribute information and multi-type node clustering in a principled way. We empirically show superior performances of CMOC-AHIN on three large scale challenging data sets and also summarize insights on the performances compared to other state-of-the-arts methodologies.},

This paper proposes a topic-enhanced emotional conversation generation model that incorporates emotional factors and topic information into the conversation system, by using two mechanisms. First, we use a Twitter latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to obtain topic words of the input sequences as extra prior information, ensuring the consistency of content between posts and responses for emotional conversation generation. Second, the system uses a dynamic emotional attention mechanism to adaptively acquire content-related and affective information of the input texts and extra topics. The advantage of this study lies in the fact that the presented model can generate abundant emotional responses, with the contents being related and diverse. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on large-scale Weibo post--response pairs. Experimental results show that our method achieves good performance, even outperforming some existing models.},

In order to address the drawbacks as mentioned above, ivLDA with topic--word distribution stemming from the Dirichlet process that has infinite atoms instead of Dirichlet distribution is proposed. ivLDA involves an incremental vocabulary that enables the topic models to process data streams. Besides, two methods are presented to manage the indices of the words, namely, ivLDA-Perp and ivLDA-PMI. ivLDA-Perp is capable of achieving high accuracy and ivLDA-PMI is able to identify the most valuable words to represent the topic.

However, these work generally neglect to consider the neighborhood effect which may help improve the accuracy of predictions. For this, we present a neighborhood-aware deep model for text tagging (NATT). A neural component which combines bi-directional recurrent neural network and self-attention mechanism, is firstly selected as the text encoder to encode the target document into one feature vector. Then, k-nearest-neighbor documents of the target document are identified and encoded into feature vectors one by one with the same text encoder. Simultaneously, an independent attention module is introduced to aggregate these neighboring documents into a special feature vector, which will represent features of the neighborhood. Finally, the two feature vectors are fused to match the embedding vectors of tags. To optimize the NATT model, we build the objective function with pairwise hinge loss and specially develop a neighborhood-aware negative sampling strategy to form training data. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that NATT outperforms some state-of-the-art neural models. Additionally, NATT is economical on achieving the best results with less training epochs and a smaller number of nearest neighbors.},

Furthermore, we utilize eight supervised multi-label classification models to facilitate disease (ICD-9 code group) prediction. We present an exhaustive comparative study to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches using standard evaluation metrics. Experimental validation on MIMIC-III, an open database, underscored the superior performance of the proposed Term weighting of unstructured notes AGgregated using fuzzy Similarity (TAGS) model, which consistently outperformed the state-of-the-art structured data based approach by 7.79% in AUPRC and 1.24% in AUROC.},

One vital requirement of cross-modal retrieval is to reduce the heterogeneity gap among various modalities so that one modality's results can be efficiently retrieved from the other. So, a novel unsupervised cross-modal retrieval framework based on associative learning has been proposed in this paper where two traditional SOMs are trained separately for images and collateral text and then they are associated together using the Hebbian learning network to facilitate the cross-modal retrieval process. Experimental outcomes on a popular Wikipedia dataset demonstrate that the presented technique outshines various existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {The need of increasing trustworthiness and transparency in artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems that adhere ethical principles of respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, fairness, and explainability; has boosting the development of systems that incorporate such issues as a key component. Recommender systems (RSs) are included in such AI-based systems, because they use intelligent algorithms for providing the most suitable items to active users according to other users' preferences. The RSs success is based on how much customers trust on the system, therefore recommendation explainability has become a crucial dimension for RSs adoption in real-world scenarios. Among the different successful applications of RS, it is remarkable the recent and exponential importance of recommendations for health and wellness areas. Hence, this paper aims at exploring, adapting and applying explanations for nutrition/recipes recommendations, that not only explain why the recommendation is enjoyable but also, it is aware of how healthy is the recommendation. Among the different methodologies to explain recommendations, this paper is focused on post-hoc explainability approaches and its adaptation, application and evaluation for nutrition/recipes recommendation. Eventually, it is included a comprehensive experimental study for characterizing the strengths and weaknesses of such explainability approaches in the recipe recommendation context.},

	abstract = {Nowadays plenty of user-generated posts, e.g., sina weibos, are published on the social media. The posts contain the public's sentiments (i.e., positive or negative) towards various topics. Bursty sentiment-aware topics from these posts reveal sentiment-aware events which have attracted much attention. To detect sentiment-aware topics, we attempt to utilize Joint Sentiment/Topic models, these models are achieved with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based models. However, most of the existing sentiment/topic models cannot be directly utilized to detect sentiment-aware topics on the posts, since applying the models to the posts directly suffers from the context sparsity problem. In this paper, we propose a Time-User Sentiment/Topic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TUS-LDA) which simultaneously models sentiments and topics for posts. Thereinto, TUS-LDA aggregates posts in the same timeslices or from the same users as pseudo-documents to alleviate the context sparsity problem. Based on TUS-LDA, we further design an approach to detect bursty sentiment-aware topics and these sentiment-ware topics can reflect bursty real-world events. Experiments on the Chinese sina weibos show that TUS-LDA outperforms previous models in the tasks of sentiment classification and burst detection in sentiment-aware topics. Finally, we visualize the bursty sentiment-aware topics discovered by TUS-LDA.},

	abstract = {Aspect level sentiment analysis is a fine-grained task in sentiment analysis. It extracts aspects and their corresponding sentiment polarity from opinionated text. The first subtask of identifying the opinionated aspects is called aspect extraction, which is the focus of the work. Social media platforms are an enormous resource of unlabeled data. However, data annotation for fine-grained tasks is quite expensive and laborious. Hence unsupervised models would be highly appreciated. The proposed model is an unsupervised approach for aspect term extraction, a guided Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model that uses minimal aspect seed words from each aspect category to guide the model in identifying the hidden topics of interest to the user. The guided LDA model is enhanced by guiding inputs using regular expressions based on linguistic rules. The model is further enhanced by multiple pruning strategies, including a BERT based semantic filter, which incorporates semantics to strengthen situations where co-occurrence statistics might fail to serve as a differentiator. The thresholds for these semantic filters have been estimated using Particle Swarm Optimization strategy. The proposed model is expected to overcome the disadvantage of basic LDA models that fail to differentiate the overlapping topics that represent each aspect category. The work has been evaluated on the restaurant domain of SemEval 2014, 2015 and 2016 datasets and has reported an F-measure of 0.81, 0.74 and 0.75 respectively, which is competitive in comparison to the state of art unsupervised baselines and appreciable even with respect to the supervised baselines.},

	abstract = {Several language applications often require word semantics as a core part of their processing pipeline either as precise meaning inference or semantic similarity. Multi-sense embeddings (m-se) can be exploited for this important requirement. m-se seeks to represent each word by their distinct senses in order to resolve the conflation of meanings of words as used in different contexts. Previous works usually approach this task by training a model on a large corpus and often ignore the effect and usefulness of the semantic relations offered by lexical resources. However, even with large training data, coverage of all possible word senses is still an issue. In addition, a considerable percentage of contextual semantic knowledge are never learned because a huge amount of possible distributional semantic structures are never explored. In this paper, we leverage the rich semantic structures in WordNet using a graph-theoretic walk technique over word senses to enhance the quality of multi-sense embeddings. This algorithm composes enriched texts from the original texts. Furthermore, we derive new distributional semantic similarity measures for m-se from prior ones. We adapt these measures to word sense disambiguation (wsd) aspect of our experiment. We report evaluation results on 11 benchmark datasets involving wsd and Word Similarity tasks and show that our method for enhancing distributional semantic structures improves embeddings quality on the baselines. Despite the small training data, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on some of the datasets.},

	abstract = {Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is nowadays a challenging task due to the large number of papers that typically compose the scientific material of the topic to review. Recently, a lot of research effort has been devoted to automate, even partially, the stages of an SLR. This paper proposes the design and implementation of a workflow and a set of tools -- called slr-kit -- to support key tasks in an SLR. The proposed approach leverages a semi-supervised strategy, in which time-consuming processes are carried out using automatic tools, whereas manual tasks have been optimized by carefully designed support tools to reduce the overall required effort. Important parts of the workflow include the extraction of key terms directly from the abstracts of the papers to survey, and the subsequent topic modeling that allows for a thematic clustering of the corpus of papers. In the proposed workflow, the former task is carried out by exploiting a novel tool, called FAst WOrd Classifier (FAWOC). The latter, instead, is designed to be automatically carried out by leveraging an ad-hoc solution based on the application of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. The result of the process consists in a set of statistics regarding the relationship among papers, topics, and their trend of publication on journals and conference proceedings. The validity of the method is demonstrated with an application to a dataset related to the scientific field of NLP, while its accuracy is assessed by the manual examination of the results by domain experts.},

In this study, we first utilize the speaker-aware structure to model the information interaction process in the dialogue, which shows an excellent ability to settle the cross-sentence dependency. Then, we incorporate the factual representations via a dual-copy decoder to obtain summaries conditioned on both the tokens from source sequences and the factual knowledge from our designed fact graph, which enhances the factual consistency for dialogue summarization. We also propose some fact-level factual consistency metrics. Adequate experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin on the SAMSum and DialSumm datasets. A comprehensive analysis also proves the effectiveness of our model. Furthermore, human judges confirm that the outputs of our model contain more informative and faithful information.},

Users can even share live streams whenever they want to reach out to many other. This prevalent usage of social media attracted companies, data scientists, and researchers who are trying to infer meaningful information from this vast amount of data. Information diffusion and maximizing the spread of words is one of the most important focus for researchers working on social media. This information can serve many purposes such as; user or content recommendation, viral marketing, and user modeling. In this research, finding topical influential/authority users on Twitter is addressed. Since Twitter is a good platform to spread knowledge as a word of mouth approach and it has many more public profiles than protected ones, it is a target media for marketers. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology, called Personalized PageRank, that integrates both the information obtained from network topology and the information obtained from user actions and activities in Twitter. The proposed approach aims to determine the topical influencers who are experts on a specific topic. Experimental results on a large dataset consisting of Turkish tweets show that using user specific features like topical focus rate, activeness, authenticity and speed of getting reaction on specific topics positively affects identifying influencers and lead to higher information diffusion. Algorithms are implemented on a distributed computing environment which makes high-cost graph processing more efficient.},

Hence, different paper recommendation models have been proposed to address this issue. However, these models lack in exploiting prominent information factors, namely: papers' citations proximity, authors' information, papers' topical relevance, venues' information, researchers' preference dynamics, and labels information to produce quality recommendations. Additionally, these models encounter problems such as cold start papers and data sparsity. To overcome these problems, this paper presents a weighted probabilistic paper recommendation model termed as PR-HNE, which jointly learns researchers' and papers' dynamics by encoding information from six information networks into a joint latent space. Specifically, it captures papers' citation proximity, authors' collaboration proximity, venues' information, labeled information, and topical relevance to generate personalized paper recommendations. Compared to state-of-the-art models, the results generated by PR-HNE over publicly available datasets prove 4% and 6% improvement in Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metrics, respectively. Further, in the cold-start papers problem, the proposed model produced 8% better recall score than its counterparts.},

Recently, an increasing number of studies proposed various travel package recommendation algorithms to improve Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) service, such as collaborative filtering-based, matrix factorization-based and neural network-based methods. Despite their value, however, the main challenges that incorporating complex descriptive information of the travel packages and capturing complicated users' long-term preferences for fine-grained travel package recommendation are still not fully resolved. In terms of these issues, this paper propose a novel model named Neural Attentive Travel package Recommendation (NATR) for tourism e-commerce by combining users' long-term preferences with short-term preferences. Specifically, NATR mainly contains two core modules, namely, travel package encoder and user encoder. The travel package encoder module is developed to learn a unified travel package representation by an attentive multi-view learning approach including word-level and view-level attention mechanisms. The user encoder module is designed to study long-term and short-term preference of the user by Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural networks with package-level attention mechanism. In addition, we further adopt a gated fusion approach to coalesce these two kinds of preferences for learning high-quality the user's representation. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real-life tourism e-commerce dataset, the results demonstrate the proposed model yields significant performance advantages over several competitive methods. Further analyses from different attention weights provide insights of attentive multi-view learning and gated fusion network, respectively.},

	abstract = {Text matching is a fundamental and critical problem in natural language understanding (NLU), where multi-level semantics matching is the most challenging task. Human beings can always leverage their semantic knowledge, while neural computer systems first learn sentence semantic representations and then perform text matching based on learned representation. However, without sufficient semantic information, computer systems will not perform very well. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel Frame-based Multi-level Semantics Representation (FMSR) model, which utilizes frame knowledge to extract multi-level semantic information within sentences explicitly for the text matching task. Specifically, different from existing methods that only rely on the sophisticated architectures, FMSR model, which leverages both frame and frame elements in FrameNet, is designed to integrate multi-level semantic information with attention mechanisms to learn better sentence representations. Our extensive experimental results show that FMSR model performs better than the state-of-the-art technologies on two text matching tasks.},

Information access systems need to be able to extract and exploit various sources of information (usually in text format) about such individuals, and to represent them in a suitable way usually in the form of a profile. In this article, we tackle the problems of profile-based expert recommendation and document filtering from a machine learning perspective by clustering expert textual sources to build profiles and capture the different hidden topics in which the experts are interested. The experts will then be represented by means of multi-faceted profiles. Our experiments show that this is a valid technique to improve the performance of expert finding and document filtering.},

However, existing network embedding learning approaches mainly focus on semantic information or temporal phenomenon such as recency or dynamic process. They failed to have the capability of incorporating multiple temporal factors/phenomenon in information networks. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes a general time-aware network representation learning framework TNE for temporal applications. TNE contains a temporally annotated network TAN, a temporally annotated meta-path based random walk method, and a self-supervised embedding learning approach. We introduce temporal nodes and relations to existing information networks to construct TAN that can incorporate multiple temporal factors. We propose a temporally annotated meta-path based random walk approach to form a time-aware hybrid neighbourhood context that considers both semantic and temporal factors. Based on the time-aware context, self-supervised representation learning approaches are used to simultaneously preserve both semantic and temporal factors in embeddings. Extensive experiments of two large scale real-life datasets show that the proposed framework is effective in various temporal applications such as temporal similarity search and temporal recommendations.},

For a successful application of the text mining process, the text representation adopted must keep the interesting patterns to be discovered. Although competitive results for automatic text classification may be achieved with traditional bag of words, such representation model cannot provide satisfactory classification performances on hard settings where richer text representations are required. In this paper, we present an approach to represent document collections based on embedded representations of words and word senses. We bring together the power of word sense disambiguation and the semantic richness of word- and word-sense embedded vectors to construct embedded representations of document collections. Our approach results in semantically enhanced and low-dimensional representations. We overcome the lack of interpretability of embedded vectors, which is a drawback of this kind of representation, with the use of word sense embedded vectors. Moreover, the experimental evaluation indicates that the use of the proposed representations provides stable classifiers with strong quantitative results, especially in semantically-complex classification scenarios.},

Traditional rumor detection approaches focus on exploring various propagation patterns or data interactions between a source microblog and its subsequent reactions. It is obvious that this causes missing interaction on rumor detection, especially in the absence of retweets or reactions. According to the communication theory of Allport and Postman (1947), Chorus (1953) and Rosnow (1988), the topic of a post can help determine its potential of being a rumor or not. Therefore, we develop a novel topic-driven rumor detection (TDRD) framework to determine whether a post is a rumor only according to its source microblog. Specifically, we first automatically perform topic classification on source microblogs, and then we successfully incorporate the predicted topic vector of the source microblogs into rumor detection. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our TDRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both two English and two Chinese benchmark datasets.},

In general, link and entity class are semantically labelled and can be used to group linked entities. However, entities are usually associated with many links and classes. To avoid information overload, we propose a novel hierarchical co-clustering approach to simultaneously group links and entity classes. In our approach, we define a measure of intra-link similarity and intra-class similarity respectively, and then incorporate them into co-clustering. Our proposed approach is implemented in a Linked Data browser called CoClus. We compare it with other three browsers by conducting a task-based user study and the experimental results show that our approach provides useful support for entity exploration.

	abstract = {With the rapid prevalence of smart mobile devices and the dramatic proliferation of mobile applications (Apps), App recommendation becomes an emergent task that will benefit different stockholders of mobile App ecosystems. However, the extreme sparsity of user-App matrix and many newly emerging Apps create severe challenges, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. Besides, unlike traditional items, Apps have rights to access users' personal resources (e.g., location, message and contact) which may lead to security risk or privacy leak. Thus, users' choosing of Apps are influenced by not only their personal interests but also their privacy preferences. Moreover, user privacy preferences vary with App categories. In light of the above challenges, we propose a mobile sparse additive generative model (Mobi-SAGE) to recommend Apps by considering both user interests and category-aware user privacy preferences in this paper. To overcome the challenges from data sparsity and cold start, Mobi-SAGE exploits both textual and visual content associated with Apps to learn multi-view topics for user interest modeling. We collected a large-scale and real-world dataset from 360 App store - the biggest Android App platform in China, and conducted extensive experiments on it. The experimental results demonstrate that our Mobi-SAGE consistently and significantly outperforms the other existing state-of-the-art methods, which implies the importance of exploiting category-aware user privacy preferences and the multi-modal App content data on personalized App recommendation.},

	abstract = {The recent deep cross-modal hashing (DCMH) has achieved superior performance in effective and efficient cross-modal retrieval and thus has drawn increasing attention. Nevertheless, there are still two limitations for most existing DCMH methods: (1) single labels are usually leveraged to measure the semantic similarity of cross-modal pairwise instances while neglecting that many cross-modal datasets contain abundant semantic information among multi-labels. (2) several DCMH methods utilized the multi-labels to supervise the learning of hash functions. Nevertheless, the feature space of multi-labels suffers the weakness of sparse, resulting in sub-optimization for the hash functions learning. Thus, this paper proposed a multi-label modality enhanced attention-based self-supervised deep cross-modal hashing (MMACH) framework. Specifically, a multi-label modality enhanced attention module is designed to integrate the significant features from cross-modal data into multi-labels feature representations, aiming to improve its completion. Moreover, a multi-label cross-modal triplet loss is defined based on the criterion that the feature representations of cross-modal pairwise instances with more common categories should preserve higher semantic similarity than other instances. To the best of our knowledge, the multi-label cross-modal triplet loss is the first time designed for cross-modal retrieval. Extensive experiments on four multi-label cross-modal datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed MMACH. Moreover, the MMACH also achieved superior performance and outperformed several state-of-the-art methods on the task of cross-modal retrieval.

Most of the existing methods consider trust in a person as a value which does not vary across different scenarios without any attention to the distinction of domains or communities where trust is derived. However, the notion of context is a significant and indispensable factor for trust evaluation in practice. Due to the lack of the consideration of context, traditional methods cannot resolve the issue that arises when a highly trustworthy person in one domain is likely to dominate the results of trust assessment in others where the person is in fact less authoritative. To solve this problem, in this paper, we develop a general approach to accomplish topic-sensitive trust evaluation by considering the context of trust. We first propose a general framework which presents the well-organized architecture of topic-sensitive trust evaluation in online communities. Then, a user-topic model is proposed to automatically extract topic data from user-generated content based on the Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LLDA) model. To compare the topic differences between users, we design a topic coverage function for revealing their trust relationships in diverse topics. Moreover, we employ two traditional methods and extend them to accomplish trust prediction for people with multiple domain knowledge. Experiments based on a real-world dataset show that extended topic-sensitive approaches are more adaptive and accurate than those topic-free trust evaluation approaches, especially when the trust application scenario features multiple topics.},

We present the Aspect Discovery for OPinion Summarisation (ADOPS) methodology, which is aimed at generating explainable and structured opinion summaries. ADOPS is built upon aspect-based sentiment analysis methods based on deep learning and Subgroup Discovery techniques. The resultant opinion summaries are presented as interesting rules, which summarise in explainable terms for humans the state of the opinion about the aspects of a specific entity. We annotate and release a new dataset of opinions about a single entity on the restaurant review domain for assessing the ADOPS methodology, and we call it ORCo. The results show that ADOPS is able to generate interesting rules with high values of support and confidence, which provide explainable and insightful knowledge about the state of the opinion of a certain entity.},

	abstract = {Web spam is an illegal and immoral way to increase the ranking of web pages by deceiving search engine algorithms. Therefore, different methods have been proposed to detect and improve the quality of results. Since a web page can be viewed from two aspects of the content and the link, the number of extracting features is high. Thus, selection of features with high separating ability can be considered as a preprocessing step in order to decrease computational time and cost. In this study, a new backward elimination approach is proposed for feature selection. The main idea of this method is measuring the impact of eliminating a set of features on the performance of a classifier instead of a single feature which is similar to the sequential backward selection. This method seeks for the largest feature subset that their omission from whole set features not only reduces the efficiency of the classifier but also improves it. Implementations on WEBSPAM-UK2007 dataset with Na{\"\i}ve Bayes classifier show that the proposed method selects fewer features in comparison with other methods and improves the performance of the classifier in the IBA index about 7%.},

Topics are represented as their neighbors in the past, or ancestors, and their structural properties are used to train binary classification models in capturing the materialization of such topics. The entirety of 197 million publications within the Microsoft Academic Graph was used to build multiple datasets, where machine learning algorithms were trained with structural features resulting in over 0.98 area under the precision--recall curve.

	abstract = {Topic sentiment joint model aims to deal with the problem about the mixture of topics and sentiment simultaneously from online reviews. Most of existing topic sentiment modeling algorithms are mainly based on the state-of-art latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), which infer sentiment and topic distributions from the co-occurrence of words. These methods have been proposed and successfully used for topic and sentiment analysis. However, when the training corpus is small or when the documents are short, the textual features become sparse, so that the results of the sentiment and topic distributions might be not very satisfied. In this paper, we propose a novel topic sentiment joint model called weakly supervised topic sentiment joint model with word embeddings (WS-TSWE), which incorporates word embeddings and HowNet lexicon simultaneously to improve the topic identification and sentiment recognition. The main contributions of WS-TSWE include the following two aspects. (1) Existing models generate the words only from the sentiment-topic-to-word Dirichlet multinomial component, but the WS-TSWE model replaces it with a mixture of two components, a Dirichlet multinomial component and a word embeddings component. Since the word embeddings are trained on a very large corpora and can be used to extend the semantic information of the words, they can provide a certain solution for the problem of the textual sparse. (2) Most of previous models incorporate sentiment knowledge in the β priors. And the priors are usually set from a dictionary and completely rely on previous domain knowledge to identify positive and negative words. In contrast, the WS-TSWE model calculates the sentiment orientation of each word with the HowNet lexicon and automatically infers sentiment-based β priors for sentiment analysis and opinion mining. Furthermore, we implement WS-TSWE with Gibbs sampling algorithms. The experimental results on Chinese and English data sets show that WS-TSWE achieved significant performance in the task of detecting sentiment and topics simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Social media is increasingly being used for communication by individuals and organizations. Social media stores vast amounts of publicly available data that provides a rich source of information and insights. Often, social media users can easily infer meaning from short text such as microblogs and Facebook posts because they understand the context and terminology used. Although automated data-mining can be effective for gaining insights from text data, a significant challenge is to accurately infer meaning from social media text derived from a single social media account. This is difficult because social media communication uses very short, or sparse, text, which yields a relatively small sample of usable words for analysis. Furthermore, interpreting the contextual meaning from a relatively small set of words is challenging. This research proposes a methodology for extracting semantic lexical chains from frequently occurring words in a single social media account and using these chains to mine short text structures to infer the overall themes of the user. The methodology is based on a proposed clustering algorithm and illustrated with examples from Facebook posts. The algorithm is tested and illustrated by comparing it to existing work and further applying it to a variety of news posts. This methodology could be useful for gaining decision-making insights from social media, or other online forms with short or sparse text.},

However, so far no attempts have been made to utilize the asymmetric relationship of firms. Thus far, most papers focus on only the target firm, and few papers focus on the target firm and relevant firms together. In this article, we propose a novel machine learning model to forecast stock price movement based on the financial news considering causality. Specifically, our method analyzes the causal relationship between companies, and it accounts for the directional impact within the Global Industry Classification Standard sectors. In our proposed method, transfer entropy is used to find causality, and multiple kernel learning is used to combine features of target firm and causal firms. Based on a Korean market dataset and out-of-sample test, our experimental results reveal that the proposed causal analytic-based framework outperforms two traditional state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed method can predict the stock price directional movements even when there is no financial news on the target firm, but financial news is published on causal firms. Our findings reveal that identifying causal relationship is important in prediction problems, and we suggest that it is important to develop machine learning algorithms and it is also important to find connections with well-established theories such as the complex system theory.},

	abstract = {The online review systems of digital platforms feature a variety of designs. This study examines how closed-form evaluations and open-ended textual comment options affect customers' online review writing behaviors and reflect satisfaction with hotels. We find that direct and spillover effects exist. These refer to the effects of customers' closed-form evaluations of a product or service attribute on their reviews of the same attribute and other attributes in their open-ended comments, respectively. Regarding the direct effect, positive closed-form evaluations of attributes reduce customers' behaviors of writing details about the same attributes in open-ended comments, but negative closed-form evaluations of attributes increase that behavior. The increasing effect is greater than the reducing effect. Regarding the spillover effect, closed-form evaluations of certain attributes increase customers' behaviors of writing details about other attributes in open-ended comments. Additionally, we find that the heterogeneity effect lies in the different roles of closed-form evaluations and open-ended textual comments in reflecting customers' overall satisfaction. Open-ended comments about the advantages of the attributes have a more significant effect than the closed-form evaluations of the same attributes in reflecting overall customer satisfaction, but closed-form evaluations better reflect customers' low overall satisfaction with the disadvantages of the attributes. The direct, spillover, and heterogeneity effects on customers' evaluations and comments regarding independent hotels are higher than those effects on evaluations and comments regarding chain hotels. The findings provide insights for companies to design review systems, understand customer perceptions, and use the positive electronic word-of-mouth effect.},

In this paper we introduce a computational model that combines topic and sentiment classification to elicit influential subjects from consumer perceptions in social media. Our model devises a novel genetic algorithm to improve clustering of tweets in semantically coherent groups, which act as an essential prerequisite when searching for prevailing topics and sentiment in big pools of data. To illustrate the validity of our model, we apply it to the Uber transportation network, from data collected through Twitter for the period between January and April 2015. The results obtained present consumer perceptions and produce insights for two fundamental brand equity dimensions: brand awareness and brand meaning.

Such content has, for example, served as a catalyst for violent uprisings and shifts in stock market prices. The collection and study of opinion have therefore become a necessity in many industries. Due to the vast nature of such data, manual approaches to this problem are no longer feasible. Several computational approaches have been proposed within the field of sentiment analysis, which successfully address many aspects of this problem, such as the classification of data into one of several sentiment categories.

In this paper, a generic framework for sentiment analysis is proposed, with a focus on facilitating the model development process for a user in a manner such that good performance may be achieved irrespective of the problem domain, as well as facilitating a flexible, exploratory analysis of model results in combination with existing structured attributes in order to gain actionable insights. The objective of the framework is to aid organisations in successfully leveraging unstructured, opinion-bearing data in combination with structured data sources to inform decision making.},

In our proposed method, LDA is first used to extract the text features hiding in the text descriptions of the accidents appearing in the claims, and deep neural networks then are trained on the data, which include the text features and traditional numeric features for detecting fraudulent claims. Based on the real-world insurance fraud dataset, our experimental results reveal that the proposed text analytics-based framework outperforms a traditional one. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the deep neural networks outperform widely used machine learning models, such as random forests and support vector machine. Therefore, our proposed framework that combines deep neural networks and LDA is a suitable potential tool for automobile insurance fraud detection.},

	abstract = {Gaining relevant insight from a dyadic dataset, which describes interactions between two entities, is an open problem that has sparked the interest of researchers and industry data scientists alike. However, the existing methods have poor explainability, a quality that is becoming essential in certain applications. We describe an explainable and scalable method that, operating on dyadic datasets, obtains an easily interpretable high-level summary of the relationship between entities. To do this, we propose a quality measure, which can be configured to a level that suits the user, that factors in the explainability of the model. We report experiments that confirm better results for the proposed method over alternatives, in terms of both explainability and accuracy. We also analyse the method's capacity to extract relevant actionable information and to handle large datasets.},

	abstract = {Text databases have grown tremendously in number, size, and volume over the last few decades. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software is used to scan the text and make them available in online repositories. The OCR transcription process is often not accurate resulting in large volumes of garbled text in the repositories. Spell correction and other post-processing of OCR text often prove to be very expensive and time-consuming. While it is possible to rely on the OCR model to assess the quality of text in a corpus, many natural language processing and information retrieval tasks prefer the extrinsic evaluation of the effect of noise on the task at hand. This paper examines the effect of noise on the unsupervised ranking of person name entities by first populating a list of person names using an out-of-the-box Named Entity Recognition (NER) software, extracting content-based features for the identified entities, and ranking them using a novel unsupervised Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) based ranking algorithm. This generative model has the ability to learn rankings using the data distribution and therefore requires limited manual intervention. Empirical results are presented on a carefully curated parallel corpus of OCR and clean text and ``in the wild'' using a large real-world corpus. Experiments on the parallel corpus reveals that even with a reasonable degree of noise in the dataset, it is possible to generate ranked lists using the KDE algorithm with a high degree of precision and recall. Furthermore, since the KDE algorithm has comparable performance to state-of-the-art unsupervised rankers, using it on real-world corpora is feasible. The paper concludes by reflecting on other methods for enhancing the performance of the unsupervised algorithm on OCR text such as cleaning entity names, disambiguating names concatenated to one another and correcting OCR errors that are statistically significant in the corpus.},

	abstract = {Priming is challenging when consumers start shortlisting products before the final purchase. This is because this shortlisting process is performed in multiple user sessions online across time, the shortlist does not stay as a static list, and product comparison in this stage uses the heuristics internal to individual consumers. The goal of this study is two folds: (1) to approximate user heuristics after B&B product shortlisting using NLP and deep learning techniques, and (2) to identify optimized deep learning models for the representation of key elements of consumer heuristics. This offers an extension of the priming theory into product comparison and shortlisting stages that were traditionally difficult for marketers to tap into. By analyzing the B&B product information repeated visited in user sessions, the formation of shortlists is identified and products in the shortlists can then be compared. Subsequent priming and promotions can therefore be performed closer to the actual purchase. Our study also provides marketers keywords and their associated activated words relevant for crafting marketing messages. As these activation words are extracted from the B&B sites and product reviews that the users had visited repeatedly in long-term tracking sessions, they are analogous to effects produced from user participatory design, an approach popular in the IT world. Our work shows that opportunities for marketing decision support, especially into the shortlisting phase, are now possible through machine learning techniques. Both theoretical and practical implications are provided.},

In this paper, we propose a label-based multimodal topic (LB-MMT) model to jointly model text and image data tagged with multiple labels. Specifically, we use the labels as supervised information to generate the text and image data. In the LB-MMT model, we assume that the textual words and visual words related to each text and image are drawn from a mixture of latent topics, where each topic is represented as a group of textual words and visual words. Moreover, we introduce multiple topics for each label, to build the top-down relationship from label to text and image. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments on a real-world multimodal dataset with labels. The results show the proposed approach obtains superior performances on topic coherence and label prediction compared with previous competitors. In addition, we show that our model yields interesting insights about multimodal topics. The proposed model provides important practical implications, e.g., designing more attractive multimodal contents for marketers.},

Sometimes, the affected organizations can detect these attacks in advance, with the help of cyber-threat intelligence derived from the explicit and implicit features of hacker communication in these forums. Herein, we proposed a novel text-mining based cyber-risk assessment and mitigation framework, which performs the following critical tasks. (i) Cyber-risk Assessment - to identify hacker expertise (i.e., newbie, beginner, intermediate, and advanced) using explicit and implicit features applying various classification algorithms. Among these features, cybersecurity keywords, sharing of attachments, and sentiments emerged as significant. Further, we found that expert hackers demonstrate leadership in the online forums that eventually serve as communities of practice. Consequently, novice hackers gradually develop their cyber-attack skills through prolonged observations, interactions, and external influences in this social learning process. (ii) Cyber-risk mitigation -- computes financial impact for every {hacker expertise, attack-type} combination, and then by ranking them on a {likelihood, impact} decision-matrix to prioritize mitigation strategies in affected organizations. Through these novel recommendations, our framework can guide managers to decide on appropriate cybersecurity controls using an {expected loss, probability, attack-type, hacker expertise} metric against financial losses due to cyber-attacks.},

	abstract = {Other than banks, non-financial companies also continuously monitor and analyze their credit risk exposure to avoid possible counterparty defaults. Credit default swaps are commonly used financial instruments that provide information on a counterparty's creditworthiness. Although this metric can provide crucial insights, the underlying price dynamics often remain unknown and require further explanation. Data-driven decision-making is a key concept for identifying these reasons and supporting and justifying decisions. In this paper, we provide such justifications by applying sentiment and topic analysis to company-related financial analyst reports. While the contents of financial news have been analyzed in the past, analyst reports can offer additional insights, as seasoned analysts use them to disseminate in-depth research to experienced investors. This analysis examines 3386 analyst reports covering constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index in the period from 2009 to 2020. The results suggest that even when established credit risk indicators and financial news are considered, the sentiment and a subset of topics are correlated with changes in the credit default swap spread, indicating a fundamental relationship between quantitative risk metric and analyst reports. We find that analyst reports contain information related to the change in credit default swap spreads, an insight that helps to improve our understanding of existing risk assessments. The outcome indicates that banks or corporate risk managers can benefit from complementing established financial metrics and even financial news data with new insights derived from analyst reports.},

	abstract = {Online product reviews have been shown to be a viable source of information for helping customers make informed purchasing decisions. In many cases, users of online shopping platforms have the ability to rate products on a numerical scale, and also provide textual feedback pertaining to a purchased product. Beyond using online product review platforms as customer decision support systems, this information rich data source could also aid designers seeking to increase the chances of their products being successful in the market through a deeper understanding of market needs. However, the increasing size and complexity of products on the market makes manual analysis of such data challenging. Information obtained from such sources, if not mined correctly, risks misrepresenting a product's true success/failure (e.g., a customer leaves a one star rating because of the slow shipping service of a product, not necessarily that he/she dislikes the product). The objective of this paper is three fold: i) to propose a machine learning approach that disambiguates online customer review feedback by classifying them into one of three direct product characteristics (i.e., form, function or behavior) and two indirect product characteristics (i.e., service and other), ii) to discover the machine learning algorithm that yields the highest and most generalizable results in achieving objective i) and iii) to quantify the correlation between product ratings and direct and indirect product characteristics. A case study involving review data for products mined from e-commerce websites is presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. A multilayered (i.e., k-fold and leave one out) validation approach is presented to explore the generalizability of the proposed method. The resulting machine learning model achieved classification accuracies of 82.44% for within product classification, 80.84% for across product classification, 79.03% for across product type classification and 80.64% for across product domain classification. Furthermore, it was determined that the form of a product had the highest Pearson Correlation Coefficient relating to a product's star rating, with a value of 0.934. The scientific contributions of this work have the potential to transform the manner in which both product designers and customers incorporate product reviews into their decision making processes by quantifying the relationship between product reviews and product characteristics.},

A widely used approach to overcome this problem is translation model. Different from prior works that only consider the relevancy of translations to a query, we intend to diversify query translations for better coverage of query topics. In this work, we have utilized the idea of clustering to group relevant translations to a given query into different clusters and then select representatives from each cluster as a set of diverse translations. We have proposed two new approaches to cluster translations. In the first one, the Mutual Information was primarily utilized as a similarity measure during clustering. In the second approach, the relevant translations are embedded in a topic space and then clustered in that space. After clustering, we propose two batch and sequential methods to select a diverse set of translations from the resultant clusters. The batch method selects the top most relevant translations from each cluster proportional to the relevancy of that cluster to the user query. The sequential one is an iterative method that looks for the most diverse set of translations considering the previously selected ones. Finally, to rank users, a regression model was utilized to learn how expert and non-expert users differ in using a set of diverse translations in their documents. Experiments on a large dataset generated from Stack Overflow demonstrate that the proposed methods improve the ranking performance over baselines in the expert finding.},

The results show a positive association among customer experience, perceived value, and customer loyalty. Notably, the physical environment and human interaction are equally important in influencing customers' value judgments about their consumption experience. Moreover, perceived value has a stronger positive effect on attitudinal loyalty than on behavioral loyalty.

However, the impact of host self-description on trust perception and whether trust perception can influence purchase behavior remain under-studied. Therefore, a text analytics framework was proposed to research the relationships among host self-description, trust perception and purchase behavior on Airbnb. Specifically, a deep-learning-based method was designed to automatically code trust perception of host self-descriptions. And the linguistic and semantic features of description texts were extracted with text mining methods. The estimated order quantity was used to quantify purchase behavior. Then, the influence of linguistic and semantic features on trust perception was identified, and the relationship between trust perception and purchase behavior was also verified. The empirical analysis derives the following findings: i. The readability of self-description is positively associated with trust perception; ii. Perspective taking expressed in self-description is also helpful; iii. Excessive positive sentiment expression can raise barriers to trust building; iv. Paying more attention to family relationship, openness, service and travel experience in self-description would be helpful; v. Trust perception can promote purchases. These findings can help hosts write better self-description, which contributes to trust building and purchases on short-term rental platforms.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to identify the customers' primary topics of concern regarding online retail brands that are shared among Twitter users. This study collects tweets associated with five leading UK online retailers covering the period from Black Friday to Christmas and New Year's sales. We use a combination of text analytical approaches including topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and network analysis to analyse the tweets. Through the analysis, we identify that delivery, product and customer service are among the most-discussed topics on Twitter. We also highlight the areas that receive the most negative customer sentiments such as delivery and customer service. Interestingly, we also identify emerging topics such as online engagement and in-store experience that are not captured by the existing literature on online retailing. Through a network analysis, we underscore the relationships among those important topics. This study derives insights on how well the leading online retail brands are performing and how their products and services are perceived by their customers. These insights can help businesses understand customers better and enable them to convert the information into meaningful knowledge to improve their business performance. The study offers a novel approach of transforming social media data into useful knowledge about online retailing. The incorporation of three analytical approaches offers insights for researchers to understand the hidden content behind the large collections of unstructured bodies of text, and this information can be used to improve online retailing services and reach out to customers.},

	abstract = {Here, we propose a preference enhanced hybrid expertise retrieval (PEHER) system in community question answering services. PEHER consists of three segments, namely, preferability estimator, authority estimator, and expertise estimator. The preferability estimator utilizes the textual information to determine both intra-profile and inter-profile preferences of answerers for each term. The intra-profile preferences consider the preference of a term using the answering history of a given answerer. The inter-profile preferences incorporate the preferences of all answerers for a term. These preferences are then used to determine the preferability of each answerer for each of the archived questions. The authority estimator considers the textual familiarity between each archived question and the profile of each answerer as the weight of the associated link in the network. The expertise estimator is composed of three blocks, namely, question similarity finder, proficiency estimator, and expert list generator. The question similarity finder finds the similarities between the new question and each of the archived questions. The proficiency estimator uses the said similarities of the archived questions along with their preferabilities to decide the proficiencies of answerers for the new question. Finally, the expert list generator considers the authorities and proficiencies to generate a list of experts for a given question. We compare PEHER with twenty existing methods on four real-world datasets using five performance measures. We find that PEHER outperforms the comparing algorithms in 92.00% (368 out of 400) cases.},

In this study, we use text mining tools to propose a method for rapid prioritization of online reviews, differentiating the reviews pertaining to innovation opportunities that are most useful for firms. We draw from the innovation and entrepreneurship literature and provide an empirical basis for the widely accepted attribute mapping framework, which delineates between desirable product attributes that firms may want to capitalize upon and undesirable attributes that they may need to remedy. Based on a large sample of reviews in the countertop appliances industry, we demonstrate the performance of our technique, which offers statistically significant improvements relative to existing methods. We validate the usefulness of our technique by asking senior managers at a large manufacturing firm to rate a selection of online reviews, and we show that the selected attribute types are more useful than alternative reviews. Our results offer insight in how firms may use online reviews to harness vital consumer feedback.},

	abstract = {Depression is a leading mental health problem affecting 300 million people globally. Recent studies show that social networks provide a tremendous potential for mental health professionals as a source of supplemental information about their patients. This study presents a methodological framework for clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) through analysis of social network data to distinguish the language usage of individuals with early signs of depression (i.e., contrast language analysis). By analyzing the contrast language patterns of different user groups, we are able to uncover constructive and actionable insights into the pain points and characteristics of users with signs of depression as decision support mechanisms for clinicians during intervention, (early) diagnosis and treatment plans. First, we discover terms that represent contrasting language by analyzing the percentage difference of terms in two user groups, labeled as''depressed'' and''non-depressed'' for ease of reference. Second, by building topic models based on social network contents, the topic-level contrast features are discovered. Finally, we consider the structure of the social network to discover the network-level contrast features. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we present a case study on early depression detection using a real-world dataset. The proposed framework has methodological contributions in enhancing the features and functionalities of CDSS for clinicians. It also contributes to evidence-based health research through cost-effective data and analytical insights that can supplement or improve the traditional survey and time-consuming interview methods.},

Even those who have not contracted the virus have experienced its far-reaching impacts, particularly on their mental health. The increased incidences of psychological problems, anxiety associated with the infection, social restrictions, economic downturn, etc., are likely to aggravate with the virus spread and leave a longer impact on humankind. These reasons in aggregation have raised concerns on mental health and created a need to identify novel precursors of depression and suicidal tendencies during COVID-19. Identifying factors affecting mental health and causing suicidal ideation is of paramount importance for timely intervention and suicide prevention. This study, thus, bridges this gap by utilizing computational intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to unveil the factors underlying mental health issues. We observed that the pandemic and subsequent lockdown anxiety emerged as significant factors leading to poor mental health outcomes after the onset of COVID-19. Consistent with previous works, we found that psychological disorders have remained pre-eminent. Interestingly, financial burden was found to cause suicidal ideation before the pandemic, while it led to higher odds of depressive (non-suicidal) thoughts for individuals who lost their jobs. This study offers significant implications for health policy makers, governments, psychiatric practitioners, and psychologists.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, platform-facilitated collaborative consumption has recently become attractive to consumers. A comparative study of consumers' online review behavior and its impact on overall satisfaction and demand in the accommodation-sharing economy and the hotel industry indicates that consumers' perceptions and behavior change gradually with changes in the level of sharing---from no sharing when staying in hotel rooms to intensive sharing when sharing rooms through collaborative consumption. Online consumer reviews focus on product and service attributes, and the influential factors of customer satisfaction and demand differ when consumers are at different accommodation-sharing levels. Not all attributes described in online reviews influence overall customer satisfaction. With a higher level of sharing, consumers' valuation changes from more to less tangible attributes. Consumers at a higher sharing level care more about social interaction and economic value than consumers at a lower sharing level. Transaction costs, particularly the information search and acquisition costs, play an important role in influencing customer purchase decisions in the sharing economy. Consumers refer to direct information for tangible attributes and to previous consumers' online reviews for intangible attributes to familiarize themselves with details before making purchase decisions. Our study provides implications that help platforms and hosts better target consumer segments with different sharing levels and more effectively utilize online reviews to generate positive electronic word of mouth to enhance consumer demand and the performance of platform economics.},

Using text-mining approaches, this study examines customers' online review-writing behavior and their overall satisfaction with restaurants in the context of on-demand food service. We use customers' overall ratings in their reviews to measure their overall satisfaction. We find that customers comment on the main service provider, the restaurants, and the auxiliary service providers, which include the drivers and on-demand service platform; in their online customer reviews, which are posted on the restaurants' web pages on the on-demand service platform. From text regressions, we found the determinants of customer satisfaction with the restaurants through their online reviews. There is a spillover effect from the performance of auxiliary providers on customer satisfaction with the main provider. That is, the performance of the drivers and the platform affects customers' overall satisfaction with the restaurants. In addition, we find that a higher cost of the order makes customers comment more on the attributes offered by the restaurants to show their overall satisfaction. Further, we find the type of listed merchants categorized by their properties (i.e., chain or independent) and participation in the platform programs affect the influence of the various attributes, offered by different providers, on customer satisfaction with the main provider. The findings shed light on the determinants of customers' overall satisfaction and urge improvement in collaboration and coordination between various participants in the on-demand service context.},

Then, a novel approximate dependence analysis is applied to further maintain complementarity while eliminating redundancy among the features selected by nonlinear orthogonal matching pursuit (NOMP). This can effectively prevent the significant bias caused by the pairwise correlation analysis for a large-scale feature set.

	abstract = {For narrative products such as movies, books, and TV shows, electronic word of mouth (eWOM) can be a double-edged sword. It provides consumers with useful information while potentially revealing the storyline, that is, spoiling the surprise of what will happen. Prior studies have focused on the impact of spoilers on consumers' experiences through psychological experiments. However, the relationship between spoilers and narrative product sales has rarely been empirically explored. To fill this gap, the current study explores the impact of spoilers on the movie box office revenue and how this impact evolves over time. We collected 279,433 reviews of 465 films on a leading community website in China and constructed a dynamic generalized method of moments (GMM) model with instrumental variables to empirically examine the spoiler effect in the movie market. Our findings indicate that spoilers have a negative influence on the movie box office revenue. However, this impact is limited to the first 6 days after the movie is released. We also discover that spoilers have a stronger negative effect on narrative-based movies than non-narrative-based movies. Furthermore, eWOM volume and eWOM variance negatively moderate the spoiler effect on the box office revenue, but the moderating effect of eWOM valence is not significant. These findings can deepen movie industry decision makers' and platform providers' understanding of spoilers, helping them devise more feasible eWOM operation strategies.},

	abstract = {The task of detecting fraudulent reviewers is of great importance to E-commerce platforms. Existing research has invested much effort into developing comprehensive features and advanced techniques to detect fraudulent reviewers. However, most of these studies have ignored the data imbalance problem inherent in fraudulent reviewer detection: non-fraudulent reviewers are the majority, while fraudulent reviewers are the minority in real practice. To fill this gap, we propose a novel approach called ImDetector to detect fraudulent reviewers while handling data imbalance based on weighted latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence. Specifically, we develop a weighted LDA model to extract the latent topics of reviewers distributed on the review features. Asymmetric KL divergence is adopted to make the similarity measure between reviewers biased toward the fraudulent minority when using the K-nearest-neighbor for classification. By mapping the reviewers to the latent topics of features derived from the weighted LDA model and measuring the similarities between reviewers using asymmetric KL divergence, the data imbalance problem in fraudulent reviewer detection is alleviated. Extensive experiments on the Yelp.com dataset demonstrate that the proposed ImDetector approach is superior to the state-of-the-art techniques used for fraudulent reviewer detection. We also explain the experimental results and present the managerial implications of this paper.},

Owing to the heterogeneity in information sources and consumers, it is necessary and meaningful to consider the potential synergy between visual and textual content as well as consumers' different cognitive styles. This paper proposes a multi-view model, namely, Deep Multi-view Information iNtEgration (Deep-MINE), to take multiple sources of content (i.e., product images, descriptions and review texts) into account and design an end-to-end recommendation model. In doing so, stacked auto-encoder networks are deployed to map multi-view information into a unified latent space, a cognition layer is added to depict consumers' heterogeneous cognition styles and an integration module is introduced to reflect the interaction of multi-view latent representations. Extensive experiments on real world data demonstrate that Deep-MINE achieves high accuracy in product ranking, especially in the cold-start case. In addition, Deep-MINE is able to boost overall model performance compared with models taking a single view, further verifying the proposed model's effectiveness on information integration.},

As the surge of social media is in vogue, social media data become an important information source for manufacturers to collect defect information. In this study, we propose a novel probabilistic graphic model to discover defects from social media data. We first use three filters, namely, sentiment filter, component-symptom filter and similarity filter, to select informative data. Second, we analyze the remaining data via the proposed probabilistic graphic model and identify defect-related data. Our method provides detailed defect information including defect types, defective components and defect symptoms which is omitted by previous research. A case study in the automobile industry validates the effectiveness and superior performance of our method compared to prior approaches.},

In contrast to traditional cooccurrence approaches, this paper proposes a novel method, namely, ICE (identifying comparable entities) for effectively identifying comparable entities from web search logs, which are online user-generated contents that reflect users' attention and preferences. ICE consists of two stages: the formulation of directly and indirectly associative relations, followed by a generative procedure that is designed for deriving a broad set of candidate entities that are indirectly associative with a specified focal entity; and a deep-learning-based semantic analysis with a word embedding procedure for measuring the similarities between entity profiles so as to target comparable entities from the candidate set. Extensive experiments show that ICE outperforms several baseline methods in the identification of accurate, broad and novel comparable entities with suitable rankings.},

	abstract = {In cross-language question retrieval (CLQR), users employ a new question in one language to search the community question answering (CQA) archives for similar questions in another language. In addition to the ranking problem in monolingual question retrieval, one needs to bridge the language gap in CLQR. The existing adversarial models for cross-language learning normally rely on a single adversarial component. Since natural languages consist of units of different abstract levels, we argue that crossing the language gap adaptatively on different levels with multiple adversarial components should lead to smoother text representation and better CLQR performance. To this end, we first encode questions into multi-layer representations of different abstract levels with a CNN based model which enhances conventional models with diverse kernel shapes and the corresponding pooling strategy so as to capture different aspects of a text segment. We then impose a set of adversarial components on different layers of question representation so as to decide the appropriate abstract levels and their role in performing cross-language mapping. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models for CLQR, which is on par with the strong machine translation baselines and most monolingual baselines.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical classification (HC) is effective when categories are organized hierarchically. However, the blocking problem makes the effect of hierarchical classification greatly reduced. Blocking means that samples are easily getting misclassified in high-level classifiers so that the samples are blocked at the high-level of the hierarchy. This issue is caused by the inconsistency between the artificially defined hierarchy and the actual hierarchy of the raw data. Another issue is that it is flippant to strictly process data following the hierarchy. Therefore, special treatment is required for some uncertain data. To address the first issue, we learn category relationships and modify the hierarchy. To address the second issue, we introduce three-way decisions (3WD) to targetedly deal with the ambiguous data. We extend original studies and propose two HC models based on 3WD, collectively referred to as TriHC, for carefully modifying the hierarchy to alleviate the blocking problem. The proposed TriHC model learns new category hierarchies by the following three steps: (1) mining category relations; (2) modifying category hierarchies according to the latent category relations; and (3) using 3WD to divide observed objects into three regions: positive region, boundary region, and negative region, and making decisions based on different strategies. Specifically, based on different category relation mining methods, there are two versions of TriHC, cross-level blocking priori knowledge based TriHC (CLPK-TriHC) and expert classifier based TriHC (EC-TriHC). The CLPK-TriHC model defines a cross-level blocking distribution matrix to mine the category relations between the higher and lower levels. To better exploit category hierarchical relations, the EC-TriHC model builds expert classifiers using topic model to learn latent category topics. Experimental results validate that the proposed methods can simultaneously reduce the blocking and improve the classification accuracy.},

	abstract = {Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE)-enhanced recommender systems are effective in providing accurate and personalized recommendations in diverse application scenarios. However, such techniques that exploit entire embedded Knowledge Graph (KG) without data relevance approval constraints fail to stop noise penetration into the data. Additionally, approaches that pay no heed to tackle semantic relations among entities remain unable to effectively capture semantical structure of Heterogeneous Information Graph (HIG). Therefore, in this paper, we propose Similarity Attributed Graph-embedding Enhancement (SAGE) approach to model similarity-aware semantic connections among entities according to their triplets' granularity. SAGE is a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding Enhancement (KGEE) method that constructs Entity-relevance-based Similarity-attributed Subgraph (ESS) to remove noise from the underlying data. It propagates interactions-enhanced knowledge over ESS to learn higher-order semantic connections among entities; and simultaneously utilizes feedbacks to enhance the interactions and regularize the model to highlight influential targets (nodes). Further, it samples influential targets in KG, independently move their preferences to the Local Central Nodes (LCN) of current influential areas, and streamline the collected information from all LCN to the main unit. Finally, a prediction module is used to determine generalized preferences for recommendation. We performed extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of SAGE where it outperformed the state-of-the-art methods with significant improvements in effectively providing the desired explainable recommendations.},

	abstract = {With the fast development of online E-commerce Websites and mobile applications, users' auxiliary information as well as products' textual information can be easily collected to form a vast amount of training data. Therefore, research efforts are urgently needed to make customized recommendations using such large but sparse data. Deep recommendation model is a natural choice for this research issue. However, most existing approaches try to investigate either user's auxiliary information such as age and zipcode, or item's textual information such as product descriptions, reviews or comments. Therefore, it is desired to see whether user's auxiliary information and item's textual information could be modeled simultaneously. This paper proposes a novel approach which is essentially a hybrid probabilistic matrix factorization model. Particularly, it has two sub components. One component tries to predict user's rating scores by capturing user's personal preferences extracted from auxiliary information. Another component tries to model item's textual attractiveness to different users via a proposed attention based convolutional neural network. We then propose a global objective function and optimize these two sub components under a unified framework. Extensive experiments are performed on five real-world datasets, i.e., ML-100K, ML-1M, ML-10M, AIV and Amazon sub dataset. The promising experimental results have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed approach when compared with both baseline models and state-of-the-art deep recommendation approaches, i.e., PMF, CDL, CTR, ConvMF, ConvMF+ and D-Attn with respect to RMSE criterion.},

As opposed to traditional single-view document modeling, which treats each document independently and learns each document as a single topic representation, the views of multi-view text documents have complicated correlation relationships that include both the global and local underlying topical information. In this study, we introduce a deep generative model for multi-view document modeling known as Hierarchical Variational Auto-Encoder (HVAE), which combines the advantages of the probability generative model for learning interpretable latent information and the deep neural network for efficient parameter inference. Specifically, a set of hierarchical topic representations is learned for each multi-view document to capture the document-level global topical information and view-level local topical information for each view. A two-level hierarchical topic inference network is investigated as the encoder network of HVAE, which is designed using an aligned variational auto-encoder, to learn the hierarchical topic representations. Subsequently, multi-view documents are generated through a two-layered generation network, considering both the view-level local and document-level global topic representations. Experiments on three real datasets of different scales for various tasks demonstrate the satisfactory results of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {With the developments of e-commerce websites, user textual review has become an important source of information for improving the performance of recommendation systems, as they contain fine-grained users' opinions that generally reflect their preference towards products. However, most of the classical recommender systems (RSs) often ignore such user opinions and therefore fail to precisely capture users' specific sentiments on products. Although a few of the approaches have attempted to utilize fine-grained users' opinions for enhancing the accuracy of recommendation systems to some extent, most of these methods basically rely on handcrafted and rule-based approaches that are generally known to be time-consuming and labour-intensive. As such, their application is limited in practice. Thus, to overcome the above problems, this paper proposes a recommendation system that utilizes aspect-based opinion mining (ABOM) based on the deep learning technique to improve the accuracy of the recommendation process. The proposed model consists of two parts: ABOM and rating prediction. In the first part, we use a multichannel deep convolutional neural network (MCNN) to better extract aspects and generate aspect-specific ratings by computing users' sentiment polarities on various aspects. In the second part, we integrate the aspect-specific ratings into a tensor factorization (TF) machine for the overall rating prediction. Experimental results using various datasets show that our proposed model achieves significant improvements compared with the baseline methods.},

	abstract = {Topic detection aims to discover valuable topics from the massive online news. It can help people to capture what is happening in real world and alleviate the burden of information overload. It also has great significance since the online news is experiencing an explosive growth. Topic detection is typically transformed into a document clustering problem, whose core idea is to cluster news documents that report on the same topic to the same group based on document similarity. Due to the complex structure and long length of news documents, the similarity measurement of news is very challenging. Existing term-based methods represent news documents based on a set of informative keywords in the document with a vector space model (VSM) and then the relationship between documents is calculated by cosine similarity. However, VSM ignores the relationship between words and has sparse semantics, which leads to low precision of topic detection. In recent years, the probabilistic methods and the graph analytical methods have been proposed for topic detection. However, both of them have high time complexity. To cope with these problems, we first present a novel document representation approach based on graphical decomposition, which decomposes each news document into different semantic units and then relationship between the semantic units is constructed to form a capsule semantic graph (CSG). The CSG can retain the relationship between words and alleviate the sparse semantics compared to VSM representation. We next introduce the graph kernel to measure the similarity between the CSGs based on their substructures. Finally, we use an incremental clustering method to cluster the news documents, in which the documents are represented by CSGs and the similarity between documents is calculated by graph kernel. The experiment results on three standard datasets show that our method obtains higher precision, recall and F1 score than several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the experiment results on a large news dataset show that our CSG-SM has lower time complexity than probabilistic methods and graph analytical methods.},

Although topic models have been verified as useful tools to facilitate the understanding of textual contents, they cannot be directly applied to accomplish this task because of two problems. The first problem is the severe data sparsity suffered by user comments because they are generally short. The second problem is the mixture of opinions from both user comments and the original documents the users commented on. To simultaneously solve the data sparsity problem and explore clean user preferences, we propose an author co-occurring topic model (AOTM) for normal documents and their short user comments. By considering authorship, AOTM allows each author of short texts to have a probability distribution over a set of topics represented only short texts. Accordingly, the individual user preferences can be investigated based on these author-level distributions. We verify the performance of AOTM using two news article datasets and one e-commerce dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the AOTM outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in topic learning and topic representation of documents. The potential usage of AOTM in exploring individual user preferences is further illustrated by drawing user portraits and predicting user posting behaviors.},

In this paper, we propose a framework for opinion subset selection. This framework can select a small set of instances from original data to convey a subjective representation for opinion classification and regression. Compared with our framework, the conventional submodular based subset selection approach cannot capture the fine-grained opinion features expressed in the corpus. Specifically, we propose a monotone non-decreasing score function and a framework based on topic modeling and submodular maximization for filtering irrelevant information and selecting the subsets. Our work further introduces an opinion-sensitive algorithm for optimizing the proposed function for opinion subset construction. We perform extensive experiments and comparative analysis of different subset selection methods in this work.

Specifically, the integration is enabled by a new generative model of text corpora. This explains topics, clusters and document content via a Bayesian generative process. In this process, documents include word vectors, to capture the (syntactic and semantic) regularities among words. Topics are multivariate Gaussian distributions on word vectors. Clusters are assigned corresponding topic distributions as their semantics. Content generation is ruled by text clusters and topics, which act as interacting latent factors. Documents are at first placed into respective clusters, then the semantics of these clusters is then repeatedly sampled to draw document topics, which are in turn sampled for word-vector generation. Under the proposed model, collapsed Gibbs sampling is derived mathematically and implemented algorithmically with parameter estimation for the simultaneous inference of text clusters and topics. A comparative assessment on real-world benchmark corpora demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in clustering texts and uncovering their semantics. Intrinsic and extrinsic criteria are adopted to investigate its topic modeling performance, whose results are shown through a case study. Time efficiency and scalability are also studied.},

The key techniques here are how to efficiently extract multi-grained aspects, identify associated opinions, and classify sentiment polarity. Although various topic models have been proposed to process some of these tasks in recent years, there was little work available for effective sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose a joint aspect based sentiment topic (JABST) model that jointly extracts multi-grained aspects and opinions through modeling aspects, opinions, sentiment polarities and granularities simultaneously. Moreover, by means of the supervised learning, we then propose a maximum entropy based JABST model (MaxEnt--JABST) to improve accuracy and performance in extracting opinions and aspects. Comprehensive evaluation results on real-world reviews for electronic devices and restaurants demonstrate that our JABST and MaxEnt--JABST models significantly outperform related proposals.},

Most existing methods for uncertain data clustering follow a partitional or a density-based clustering approach, whereas little research has been devoted to the hierarchical clustering paradigm. In this work, we push forward research in hierarchical clustering of uncertain data by introducing a well-founded solution to the problem via an information-theoretic approach, following the initial idea described in our earlier work [26]. We propose a prototype-based agglomerative hierarchical clustering method, dubbed U-AHC, which employs a new uncertain linkage criterion for cluster merging. This criterion enables the comparison of (sets of) uncertain objects based on information-theoretic as well as expected-distance measures. To assess our proposal, we have conducted a comparative evaluation with state-of-the-art algorithms for clustering uncertain objects, on both benchmark and real datasets. We also compare with two basic definitions of agglomerative hierarchical clustering that are treated as baseline methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency of the clustering results, respectively. Main experimental findings reveal that U-AHC generally outperforms competing methods in accuracy and, from an efficiency viewpoint, is comparable to the fastest baseline version of agglomerative hierarchical clustering.},

To solve the problem of product ranking based on online reviews, two important issues must be addressed: sentiment analysis and product ranking based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated MCDM method for product ranking through online reviews based on evidential reasoning (ER) theory and stochastic dominance (SD) rules. First, online reviews are preprocessed to obtain product attributes and weight values. Then, we use naive Bayes (NB), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM) for the sentiment analysis of online reviews, and the results of the three classifiers are aggregated using ER theory. In addition, according to the confidence distribution matrix of sentiment orientations, SD rules are used to determine the stochastic dominance relations between pairwise alternatives for each attribute. Furthermore, we use the stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA)-PROMETHEE method to obtain the final product ranking results and conduct sensitivity analysis. Finally, a case study on ranking computer products from JD Mall through online reviews is provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed method.},

These approaches are limited and inefficient because they provide no opportunity to change citizens' opinions once they have been formed. Furthermore, incorporating auxiliary information to enrich semantic representations is vital and challenging due to limited texts, and a lack of both semantic information and strict syntactic structure. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to extract and integrate multidimensional features from user-related and policy-related social media information and predict policy comment polarity in the policy release phase. First, we construct four machine learning models for model-induced features to capture topic-related and opinion-related features and identify the policy-opinion nexus. In addition, we integrate basic and behavioral user features. Then, we leverage multidimensional features to construct a stacked learning model for predicting the policy opinion. Finally, we conduct experiments on 20 policy comment datasets to demonstrate that our prediction framework can effectively predict public opinion about a policy once it is released. Our model provides key insights into policy opinions in advance and can enable policymakers to engage in better policy communication before opinion formation.},

	abstract = {Short texts are everywhere in the Web, including messages posted in social media, status messages and blog comments, and uncovering the topics of this type of messages is crucial to a wide range of applications, e.g., context analysis and user characterization. Extracting topics from short text is challenging because of the dependence of conventional methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in words co-occurrence, which in short text is rare and make these methods suffer from severe data sparsity. This paper proposes a general framework for topic modeling of short text by creating larger pseudo-document representations from the original documents. In the framework, document components (e.g., words or bigrams) are defined over a metric space, which provides information about the similarity between them. We present two simple, effective and efficient methods that specialize our general framework to create larger pseudo-documents. While the first method considers word co-occurrence to define the metric space, the second relies on distributed word vector representations. The pseudo-documents generated can be given as input to any topic modeling algorithm. Experiments run in seven datasets and compared against state-of-the-art methods for extracting topics by generating pseudo-documents or modifying current topic modeling methods for short text show the methods significantly improve results in terms of normalized pointwise mutual information. A classification task was also used to evaluate the quality of the topics in terms of document representation, where improvements in F1 varied from 1.5 to 15%.},

In this work, we are concerned specifically with complex text annotation crowdsourcing tasks, where each answer of a task is in the form of free text. We propose an error consistency-based approach to inferring a satisfying result from a set of open-ended answers. First, each answer is represented with two vectors that capture the local word collocation and the global sentence semantics respectively. Second, the true answer is approximated by the sum of the answer vectors weighted by the reciprocals of their respective errors. Third, an algorithm called AEC (Aggregation based on Error Consistency) is designed to infer the aggregated result by maximizing the consistency of the errors of an answer in two vector spaces. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

	abstract = {Text is one of the most common unstructured data, and usually, the most primary task in text mining is to transfer the text into a structured representation. However, the existing text representation models split the complete semantic unit and neglect the order of words, finally lead to understanding bias. In this paper, we propose a novel phrase-based text representation method that takes into account the integrity of semantic units and utilizes vectors to represent the similarity relationship between texts. First, we propose HPMBP (Hierarchical Phrase Mining Based on Parsing) which mines hierarchical phrases by parsing and uses BOP (Bag Of Phrases) to represent text. Then, we put forward three phrase embedding models, called Phrase2Vec, including Skip-Phrase, CBOP (Continuous Bag Of Phrases), and GloVeFP (Global Vectors For Phrase Representation). They learn the phrase vector with semantic similarity, further obtain the vector representation of the text. Based on Phrase2Vec, we propose PETC (Phrase Embedding based Text Classification) and PETCLU (Phrase Embedding based Text Clustering). PETC utilizes the phrase embedding to get the text vector, which is fed to a neural network for text classification. PETCLU gets the vectorization expression of text and cluster center by Phrase2Vec, furthermore extends the K-means model for text clustering. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that focuses on the phrase-based English text representation. Experiments show that the introduced Phrase2Vec outperforms state-of-the-art phrase embedding models in the similarity task and the analogical reasoning task on Enwiki, DBLP, and Yelp dataset. PETC is superior to the baseline text classification methods in the F1-value index by about 4%. PETCLU is also ahead of the prevalent text clustering methods in entropy and purity indicators. In summary, Phrase2Vec is a promising approach to text mining.},

	abstract = {Image classification refers to the task of automatically classifying the categories of images based on the contents. This task is typically solved using visual features with the histogram based classification scheme. Although effective, this strategy has two drawbacks. On one hand, histogram based representation often disregards the object layout which is very important for classification. On the other hand, visual features are unable to fully separate different images due to the semantic gap. To solve these two problems, in this paper, we propose a novel image classification method by explicitly and implicitly representing the images with searching strategy. First, to make use of object layouts, we randomly select a number of regions and then use these regions for image representations. Second, we generate the explicitly semantic representations using a number of pre-learned semantic models. Third, we measure the visual similarities with the Internet images and use the text information for implicitly semantic representations. Since Internet images are contaminated with noise, the resulting representations only implicitly reflect the contents of images. Finally, both the explicitly and implicitly semantic representations are jointly modeled for image classifications by training bi-linear classifiers. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed image classification by search with explicitly and implicitly semantic representations method (EISR) on the Scene-15 dataset, the MIT-Indoor dataset, the UIUC-Sports dataset and the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. The experimental results prove the usefulness of the proposed method.},

These learned representations can be used for subsequent applications, such as vertex classification and link prediction. Negative Sampling (NS) is the most widely used method for boosting the performance of NRL. However, most of the existing work only randomly draws negative samples based on vertex frequencies, i.e., the vertices with higher frequency are more likely to be drawn, which ignores the situation that the sampled one may not be a true negative sample, thus, lead to undesirable embeddings. In this paper, we propose a new negative sampling method, called Hierarchical Negative Sampling (HNS), which is able to model the latent structures of vertices and learn the relations among them. During sampling, HNS can draw more appropriate negative samples and thereby obtain better performance on network embeddings. Firstly, we theoretically demonstrate the superiority of HNS over NS. And then we use experimental results to show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on vertex classification tasks at different training scales in real-world networks.},

	abstract = {Exploring the demographic attributes and social networks of Internet users is widely employed by many applications, such as recommendation systems. The popularity of mobile devices (notably smartphones) and location-based Internet services (e.g., Google Maps) facilitates the collection of users' locations over time. There have been recent efforts to predict users' attributes (e.g., age and gender) from this data, and location-based social networks such as Foursquare and Gowalla are based on using the rich location context knowledge of points of interest (e.g., the name, type and description of restaurants and hotels) where users check-in online. However, little attention has been paid to inferring the attributes and social networks of mobile device users based on their spatiotemporal trajectories where there is little or no location context knowledge. In this paper, we collect logs of thousands of mobile devices' network connections to wireless access points (APs) of two campuses, and investigate whether one can infer mobile device users' demographic attributes and social networks solely from their spatiotemporal AP-trajectories. We develop a tensor factorization-based method Dinfer to infer mobile device users' attributes from their AP-trajectories by leveraging prior knowledge. Compared with our previous work, which only considered users' social networks, Dinfer further utilizes AP spatial information and achieves a 2% improvement. We also propose a novel method Sinfer to learn social networks between mobile device users by exploring patterns of their AP-trajectories, such as fine-grained co-occurrence events (e.g., co-coming, co-leaving, and co-presenting duration). Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.},

	abstract = {Multi-topic sentiment analysis, which aims to identify the topics and classify their corresponding sentiment, is of great value in understanding consumers' behaviour and improving services. Because of the high cost of manual annotation of the datasets, topic model-based approaches that model the joint distributions of both topics and sentiments have been studied previously. Some studies proposed models that leverage the prior knowledge derived from the pre-trained word embeddings and have proven effective. However, most of the existing models are based on the assumption that words and topics are conditionally independent, ignoring the dependency relations among them. Additionally, the fine-tuning of the pre-trained word embeddings to incorporate the contextual information is also neglected in these models. This could result in the ambiguous representations of topics. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised graph-based joint sentiment topic model (W-GJST) that integrates an edge-gated graph convolutional network (E-GCN) into a joint sentiment-topic model. An importance sampling-based training method is proposed to learn the contextual representations of topics and words efficiently. Additionally, a self-training multi-topic classifier is designed for the multi-label topic identification. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed W-GJST compared to the baseline models in terms of topic modelling, topic identification and topic-sentiment identification.},

To fulfill this type of classification, previous works have focused on leveraging task-specific features. However, they only notice part of the related features. Also, state-of-the-art methods based on neural networks often ignore traditional features. This paper proposes a novel text sentiment classification method that learns the representation of texts by hierarchically incorporating multiple features. More specifically, we design different representations for sentiment words according to the polarity of labeled texts and whether negation exists; we distinguish words with different part-of-speech tags; emoticons, if there are, are to optimize the word vectors obtained in the previous step; apart from word embeddings, character embeddings are also trained. We use a deep neural network to get a sentence-level representation from both word and character sequence. For documents with at least two sentences, we use a hierarchical structure and design a rule to give more weight to import sentences empirically to get a document-level representation. Experimental results on open datasets demonstrate that our method could effectively improve the sentiment classification performance compared with the basic models and state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Recommendation system (RS) is designed to provide personalized services based on the users' historical data. It has been applied in various fields and is expected to recommend the suitable services for the different kinds of users. Considering the importance of individual privacy, current users gradually tend not to expose personal information. This means RS may face the highly sparse datasets in the fields of cloud security. In general, the accuracy of recommendation will be improved with the growth of individual data, but the cold start problem is exactly in this contradictory phenomenon: this question evolves to produce sufficiently accurate recommendation result under the data scarcity problem. RS has to recommend services for the rarely historical data users and the latent users might drain along with the production of counter effects. To alleviate data scarcity problem in cloud security environment, this work is to introduce similar domain knowledge based on the transfer learning. Besides, the content and location based methods have been proved that these ideas work under this situation. So, this work also employs latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) to analysis the service descriptions and explore the relationship between the content and location information. In this framework, the suitable combination of LDA and word2vec models will balance the accuracy and speed which benefit service recommendation particularly. The related experiments demonstrate the effectiveness on the real word dataset. It can be found that the transfer learning based word2vec model shows the potentiality to explore the relationship between topic words, and improve the LDA algorithm from the content relationship. This proves that in both cold start environment and warm start environment, the proposed algorithm is more robust than other model-based state-of-art methods.},

Research in this line mostly exploits data co-occurrence and often overlooks the complex and ambiguous meanings of tags. Furthermore, there have been few comprehensive evaluation studies regarding the quality of the discovered knowledge. We propose a supervised learning method to discover subsumption relations from tags. The key to this method is quantifying the probabilistic association among tags to better characterise their relations. We further develop an algorithm to organise tags into hierarchies based on the learned relations. Experiments were conducted using a large, publicly available dataset, Bibsonomy, and three popular, human-engineered or data-driven knowledge bases: DBpedia, Microsoft Concept Graph, and ACM Computing Classification System. We performed a comprehensive evaluation using different strategies: relation-level, ontology-level, and knowledge base enrichment based evaluation. The results clearly show that the proposed method can extract knowledge of better quality than the existing methods against the gold standard knowledge bases. The proposed approach can also enrich knowledge bases with new subsumption relations, having the potential to significantly reduce time and human effort for knowledge base maintenance and ontology evolution.},

The existing recommender systems, however, recommend items based on the overall ratings or the click-through rate, and emotions expressed by users are neglected. Conversely, the cold-start problem and low model scalability are the two main problems with recommender systems. The cold-start problem is encountered when the system lacks initial rating. Low model scalability indicates that a model is incapable of coping with high-dimensional data. These two problems may mislead the recommender system, and thus, users will not be satisfied with the recommended items. A hybrid recommender system is proposed to mitigate the negative effects caused by these problems. Additionally, ontologies are applied to integrate the extracted features into topics to reduce dimensionality. Topics mentioned in the items are displayed in the form of a topic map, and users can refer to these similar items for further information.},

	abstract = {Extraneous growth of scientific information over the Internet makes the searching task non-trivial and as a consequence researchers are facing difficulties in finding relevant papers from the millions of research papers in digital repositories. The research paper recommendation systems have been advocated to address this problem. The existing research paper recommendation systems lack in exploiting prominent information of papers, such as relevancy with the current time, novelty, scientific contribution, writing complexity of the papers, etc. Further, the existing models emphasize only on user's preference rather than user's intention that may change with time. Furthermore, the existing models do not consider a sound ranking strategy to unleash the personalization aspect and relevancy of papers. This work aims to address the existing limitations and proposes a systematic hidden attribute-based recommendation engine (SHARE). SHARE utilizes a feature engineering technique to unfold valuable insights of papers through multiple hidden features. These features are used as a context for users as well as multiple criteria for ranking papers. Additionally, SHARE predicts a user's intention beyond the user's preference to capture the dynamic notion of a user. Finally, a novel ranking strategy is proposed to retrieve personalized and the most important papers. SHARE is flexible for recommending both old and new users. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of SHARE both user studies and system evaluations were performed. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the proposed approach and are comparable to the existing systems.},

Understanding what topics are important to users and the corresponding internal motivation is crucial for managers to successfully engage customers and promote business through social media. Assuming topic preference is the outcome of intrinsic factors such as gender, age and personality traits, this paper proposes an improved nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian topic (NHBT) model to investigate the multiple-to-multiple generative relationships from intrinsic factors to topic preferences. The proposed NHBT model employs a three-level generation framework based on Dirichlet process to study the impact of intrinsic factors on users topic preference. Our study of Facebook data shows that NHBT model is able to draw valuable latent topics (e.g. music band, chemical biology, cosplay) from the open social media environment, and reveal the internal motivation for users topic selection behaviors (e.g. users with low conscientiousness and high extraversion personality prefer topics about campus party). Our experiments also show that NHBT model can identify the intrinsic factors dominating topic preferences for individual users, and provide foundations to predict the intrinsic factors for new user generated contents.},

In social networks, while considering user content interests, first, a fusion user embedding method was developed by incorporating external knowledge semantics. Second, for a user pair, we calculate their direct similar relationship using fusion user embeddings. Additionally, based on intermediate neighbors, we compute their indirect similar relationship by using an attention mechanism, which explains neighbors' bootable and transitive influences for learning the social relationship of user pairs. Then, a hybrid personalized and neighbor attention model for friend link prediction was proposed by considering direct and indirect factors.

Analyzing these reports for crime type prediction helps the law enforcement agencies deal with crime prevention strategies. But it is quite a demanding and difficult task to consider these reports individually and determine their crime types. In the proposed work, an efficient classifier has been designed to analyze the crime reports which not only predict the crime types of the reports but at the same time upgrades itself with the help of new crime reports. Therefore, this task demands an incremental supervised learning technique that continuously learns the existing classifier based on the new set of reports and information already extracted from the old set of reports. Developing an incremental classifier infuses the knowledge that keep coming from the newly generated reports and help in increasing the report-discriminating power of the classifier. In this work, we have applied a Bi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization technique for generating an efficient incremental classifier for classifying and predicting the crime reports dynamically. Crime reports of different countries, such as India, the United States of America, and the United Arab Emirates, have been collected from online classified newspapers to measure the performance of the proposed as well as some state-of-the-art classifiers. Also, the method has been evaluated based on an unbiased police witness narrative crime reports and finally, a statistical test has been performed using all four considered datasets to measure the statistical significance of the proposed methodology.},

Focusing on rhythm, we formulate several classes of Bayesian Markov models of musical scores that describe repetitions indirectly using the sparse transition probabilities of notes or note patterns. This enables us to construct piece-specific models for unseen scores with an unfixed repetitive structure and to derive tractable inference algorithms. Moreover, to describe approximate repetitions, we explicitly incorporate a process for modifying the repeated notes/note patterns. We apply these models as prior musical score models for rhythm transcription, where piece-specific score models are inferred from performed MIDI data by Bayesian learning, in contrast to the conventional supervised construction of score models. Evaluations using the vocal melodies of popular music showed that the Bayesian models improved the transcription accuracy for most of the tested model types, indicating the universal efficacy of the proposed approach. Moreover, we found an effective data representation for modelling rhythms that maximizes the transcription accuracy and computational efficiency.},

Supervised cross-modal hashing methods leverage the labels of training data to improve the retrieval performance. However, most of these methods still assume that the semantic labels of training data are ideally complete and noise-free. This assumption is too optimistic for real multi-modal data, whose label annotations are, in essence, error-prone. To achieve effective cross-modal hashing on multi-modal data with noisy labels, we introduce an end-to-end solution called Noise-robust Deep Cross-modal Hashing (NrDCMH). NrDCMH contains two main components: a noise instance detection module and a hash code learning module. In the noise detection module, NrDCMH firstly detects noisy training instance pairs based on the margin between the label similarity and feature similarity, and specifies weights to pairs using the margin. In the hash learning module, NrDCMH incorporates the weights into a likelihood loss function to reduce the impact of instances with noisy labels and to learn compatible deep features by applying different neural networks on multi-modality data in a unified end-to-end framework. Experimental results on multi-modal benchmark datasets demonstrate that NrDCMH performs significantly better than competitive methods with noisy label annotations. NrDCMH also achieves competitive results in `noise-free' scenarios.},

	abstract = {As one of the prevalent topic mining methods, neural topic modeling has attracted a lot of interests due to the advantages of low training costs and strong generalisation abilities. However, the existing neural topic models may suffer from the feature sparsity problem when applied to short texts, due to the lack of context in each message. To alleviate this issue, we propose a Context Reinforced Neural Topic Model (CRNTM), whose characteristics can be summarized as follows. First, by assuming that each short text covers only a few salient topics, the proposed CRNTM infers the topic for each word in a narrow range. Second, our model exploits pre-trained word embeddings by treating topics as multivariate Gaussian distributions or Gaussian mixture distributions in the embedding space. Extensive experiments on two benchmark short corpora validate the effectiveness of the proposed model on both topic discovery and text classification.},

During the learning process, most of existing methods tend to treat all the words equally regardless of their possibly different intrinsic nature. We believe that for some types of documents (e.g., news articles), entity mentions are more informative than ordinary words and it can be beneficial for certain tasks if they are properly utilized. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning low-dimensional vector representations of documents. The learned representations captures information of not only the words in documents, but also the entity mentions in documents and the connections between different entities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is able to significantly improve text clustering, text classification performance and outperform previous studies on the TAC-KBP entity linking benchmark.},

The method allows us to handle temporal diversity of high-level activities. The framework consists of multi-temporal analysis, multi-temporal perception layers, and late fusion. We build two types of perception layers based on situation graph trees (SGT) and support vector machines (SVMs). The results obtained from the multi-temporal perception layers are fused into an activity score through a step of late fusion. To verify this approach, we apply the framework to violent events detection in visual surveillance and experiments are conducted by using three datasets: BEHAVE, NUS--HGA and some videos from YouTube that show real situations. We also compare the proposed framework with existing single-temporal frameworks. The experiments produced results with accuracy of 0.783 (SGT-based, BEHAVE), 0.702 (SVM-based, BEHAVE), 0.872 (SGT-based, NUS--HGA), and 0.699 (SGT-based, YouTube), thereby showing that using our multi-temporal approach has advantages over single-temporal methods.},

	abstract = {Question retrieval is an extremely important research field in Community Question Answering (CQA). Most existing question retrieval methods depend on semantic analysis of questions, whose effectiveness suffers from the short texts of the noise words in the question corpus. In order to recommend the questions with more advanced knowledge to users, the influence of the questions' popularity should be considered during retrieving questions. To make retrieved questions with both similar semantics and high popularity, we propose an Integrated Retrieval Framework for Similar Questions named Word-semantic Embedded Label Clustering -- LDA with Question Life Cycle (WELQLC-QR), consisting of Word-semantic Embedded Label Clustering -- LDA (WEL) and Question Life Cycle Optimization Similar Question List Strategy (QLC). Firstly, WEL is proposed for question retrieval from the perspective of semantic matching. It not only overcomes the problem of over-generalization of the semantic information extracted by topic models when facing short questions with multi-levels labels, but also avoids the influence of noise vocabularies during semantic extracting of the questions. Then, based on the internal factors (i.e., the number of comments and answers to the question) and external factors (i.e., programming language ranking information) of questions, QLC constructs a popularity-predicted model to optimize the similar question set searched by WEL, making the final retrieval results both semantically similar and popular. Finally, experiments are conducted on CQADupStack dataset, and results show that the MRR@N of WELQLC-QR model has an average increase of 8.99%, 8.3%, 4.74% and 3.56% compared with that of L-LDA, LC-LDA, BM25 and Word2vec, respectively.},

As such, finding a group of experts to collaboratively answer the questions is of paramount importance. To this end, we propose a novel approach to form teams of experts who can collectively answer new questions. The proposed approach, called team2box, learns neural embedding representations based on the content of the posted questions, experts' engagement with these questions, and past expert collaboration history in order to form a team to answer the posted question. It embeds experts and questions as points and existing teams as regions within the embedding space. Therefore, team2box forms a team whose members (1) collectively cover the knowledge required to answer a question, (2) have successful past experience in jointly answering similar questions, and (3) can work efficiently together to answer the question. Extensive experiments on real-life datasets from Stack Exchange show that team2box outperforms the state-of-the-art by discovering teams with on average 38.97% more covering the skills required to answer new questions and employing experts with collectively a high expertise level.},

Understanding the stances people take is beneficial and critical for many security and business related applications, such as policy design, emergency response and marketing management. Most previous work on stance detection focuses on identifying the supportive or unsupportive attitudes towards a specific target. However, another important type of stance detection, i.e. multiple standpoint detection, has been largely ignored. Multiple standpoint detection aims to identify the distinct standpoints people hold among multiple parties, which reflects people's intrinsic values and judgments. When expressing standpoints, people tend to discuss diverse topics, and the word usage in the topics of different standpoints often varies a lot. As topics can provide latent information for identifying various standpoints, in this paper, we propose a topic-based approach to detecting multiple standpoints in Web texts, by enhancing generative classification model as well as feature representation of texts. In addition, we develop an adaptive process to determine parameter values in our approach automatically. Experimental studies on several real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach in detecting multiple standpoints.},

In the social platforms, the text information can effectively reflect the user opinions or the public opinions for a certain entity, such as company, celebrity service, product and so on. Therefore, mining user opinions from social networks have become an imperative requirement for the service groups. In this paper, an opinion community detection method is proposed by considering the content similarity, the time similarity and the topology structure of users. The integrated similarity between two users, which includes the content similarity, the time similarity and the topology structure of users, is achieved. Then, based on the integrated similarities, the opinion communities are detected. Furthermore, in order to identify the opinion leader, an opinion leader detection method is proposed based on the user influence and emotional analysis. The users with the same topic form the opinion community. Meanwhile, a directed graph is created to formulate the interaction relationship between users in the opinion community. Then, the user influence model and emotional analysis model are presented. Moreover, the occurrence frequencies of the negative words are also considered in the emotional analysis model. Then, a model of influence value for each user in the opinion community is built. The user with the highest influence value is considered as the opinion leader. Finally, the performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated in a distributed computing environment. Meanwhile, the extensive experiments are conducted. The results indicate that our proposed opinion community detection algorithm can effectively detect the opinion communities. Also, the proposed opinion leader detection algorithm can significantly identify the opinion leader in the social networks.},

Given the importance of this task, various methods have already been proposed in the literature that focus on syntactic, semantic and neural representations of tables for determining table relevance. However, recent works have highlighted queries that are consistently difficult for baseline methods to satisfy, referred to as hard queries. For this reason, the objectives of this paper include: (1) effectively satisfying hard queries by proposing three classes of qualitative measures, namely coherence, interpretability and exactness, (2) offering a systematic approach to interpolate these three classes of measures with each other and with baseline table retrieval methods, and (3) performing extensive experiments using a range of baseline retrieval methods to show the feasibility of the proposed measures for hard queries. We demonstrate that the consideration of the proposed qualitative measures will lead to improved performance for hard queries on a range of state-of-the-art ad hoc table retrieval baselines. We further show that our proposed measures are synergistic and will lead to even higher performance improvements over the baselines when interpolated with each other. The improvements measure up to 22.94% on the Semantic Table Retrieval (STR) method with an NDCG@20 of 0.5, which is superior to the performance of any state-of-the-art baseline for hard queries in the ad hoc table retrieval task.},

Result diversification requires that image retrieval systems are made capable of handling semantic gaps between image visual features and semantic concepts, and providing both relevant and diversified image results. Context information, such as captions, descriptions, and tags, provides opportunities for image retrieval systems to improve their result diversification. This study explores a mechanism for improving result diversification using the semantic distance of image social tags. We design and compare nine strategies that combine three different semantic distance algorithms (WordNet, Google Distance, and Explicit Semantic Analysis) with three re-ranking algorithms (MMR, xQuAD, and Score Difference) for result diversification. In order to better prove the effectiveness of our strategy of applying semantic information, we also make use of visual features of images for result diversification experiment and make comparison. Our data for experimentation were extracted from 269,648 images selected from the NUS-WIDE datasets with manually annotated subtopics. Experimental results affirm the effectiveness of applying semantic information for improving result diversification in image retrieval. In particular, WordNet-based semantic distance combined with the Score Difference (WordNet-DivScore) outperformed other strategies in diversifying image retrieval results.},

	abstract = {Co-clustering aims to explore coherent patterns by simultaneously clustering samples and features of data. Several co-clustering methods have been proposed in the past decades. However, in real-world applications, datasets are often with multiple modalities or composed of multiple representations (i.e., views), which provide different yet complementary information. Hence, it is essential to develop multi-view co-clustering models to solve the multi-view application problems. In this paper, a novel multi-view co-clustering method based on bipartite graphs is proposed. To make use of the duality between samples and features of multi-view data, a bipartite graph for each view is constructed such that the co-occurring structure of data can be extracted. The key point of utilizing the bipartite graphs to deal with the multi-view co-clustering task is to reasonably integrate these bipartite graphs and obtain an optimal consensus one. As for this point, the proposed method can learn an optimal weight for each bipartite graph automatically without introducing an additive parameter as previous methods do. Furthermore, an efficient algorithm is proposed to optimize this model with theoretically guaranteed convergence. Extensive experimental results on both toy data and several benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

In this paper, we introduce the class of Constrained Relational Topic Models (CRTM), a semi-supervised extension of RTM that, apart from modeling the structure of the document network, explicitly models some available domain knowledge. We propose two instances of CRTM that incorporate prior knowledge in the form of document constraints. The models smooth the probability distribution of topics such that two constrained documents can either share the same topics or denote distinct themes. Experimental results on benchmark relational datasets show significant performances of CRTM on a semi-supervised document classification task.},

	abstract = {The purpose of document classification is to assign the most appropriate label to a specified document. The main challenges in document classification are insufficient label information and unstructured sparse format. A semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach could be an effective solution to the former problem, whereas the consideration of multiple document representation schemes can resolve the latter problem. Co-training is a popular SSL method that attempts to exploit various perspectives in terms of feature subsets for the same example. In this paper, we propose multi-co-training (MCT) for improving the performance of document classification. In order to increase the variety of feature sets for classification, we transform a document using three document representation methods: term frequency--inverse document frequency (TF--IDF) based on the bag-of-words scheme, topic distribution based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and neural-network-based document embedding known as document to vector (Doc2Vec). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MCT is robust to parameter changes and outperforms benchmark methods under various conditions.},

Currently, most of these are single-objective and search for items that fit the overall preference of a particular user. In real applications, such as restaurant recommendations, however, users often have multiple objectives such as group preferences and restaurant ambiance. This paper highlights the need for multi-objective recommendations and provides a solution using hypergraph ranking. A general User--Item--Attribute--Context data model is proposed to summarize different information resources and high-order relationships for the construction of a multipartite hypergraph. This study develops an improved balanced hypergraph ranking method to rank different types of objects in hypergraph data. An overall framework is then proposed as a guideline for the implementation of multi-objective recommender systems. Empirical experiments are conducted with the dataset from a review site Yelp.com, and the outcomes demonstrate that the proposed model performs very well for multi-objective recommendations. The experiments also demonstrate that this framework is still compatible for traditional single-objective recommendations and can improve accuracy significantly. In conclusion, the proposed multi-objective recommendation framework is able to handle complex and changing demands for e-commerce customers.},

This paper is focused on improving the aspect term extraction of topic models by incorporating product descriptions to the current state-of-the-art sentiment topic model, Aspect Sentiment Unification Model (ASUM). We present two models that extend from ASUM differently to leverage on the information found in the product description: Seller-aided Aspect-based Sentiment Model (SA-ASM) and Seller-aided Product-based Sentiment Model (SA-PSM). SA-ASM has its topic distribution inside the review while SA-PSM has its topic distribution inside the product description. Based on experiments conducted to reviews of laptops and mobile phones, results show that SA-ASM performs better in micro-level problems such as sentiment classification and aspect assignment and SA-PSM performs better in macro-level problems like aspect category detection.

	abstract = {With the advent of online social networks, people became more eager to express and share their opinions and sentiment about all kinds of targets. The overwhelming amount of opinion texts soon attracted the interest of many entities (industry, e-commerce, celebrities, etc.) that were interested in analyzing the sentiment people express about what they produce or communicate. This interest has led to the surge of the sentiment analysis (SA) field. One of the most studied subfields of SA is polarity detection, which is the problem of classifying a text as positive, negative, or neutral. This classification problem is difficult to solve automatically, and many hand-adjusted resources are needed to overcome the difficulties in detecting sentiment from text. These resources include hand-adjusted textual features as well as lexicons. Deciding which resource and which combination of resources are more appropriate to a given scenario is a time-consuming trial-and-error process. Thus, in this work, we propose the use of Genetic Programming (GP) as a tool for automatically choosing, combining, and classifying sentiment from text. We propose a series of functions that allow GP to deal with preprocessing tasks, handcrafted features, and automatic weighting of lexicons for a given training set. Our experiments show that our GP solution is competitive and sometimes better than SVM and superior to na{\"\i}ve Bayes, logistic regression, and stochastic gradient descent, which are methods used in SA competitions.},

	abstract = {With the development of social networking applications, microblog has turned to be an indispensable online communication network in our daily life. For microblog users, recommending high quality information is a demanding service. Some microblog services encourage users to annotate themselves with tags, which are used to describe their interests or attributes. However, few users are willing to create tags and available tags are not fully exploited for microblog recommendation. Besides, following/follower relationship in microblog is asymmetric, which can be used not only for communicating with friends or acquaintances but also for getting information on particular subjects. So far, there is no microblog recommendation algorithm which employs all the above mentioned information. This paper aims to investigate a joint framework to combine tag correlation and user social relation for microblog recommendation. Our approach identifies users' interests via their personal tags and social relations. More specifically, a user tag retrieval strategy is established to add tags for users without or with few tags, and the user-tag matrix is then built and user-tag weights are then obtained. In order to solve the problem of sparsity of the matrix, both inner and outer correlation between tags are investigated to update the user-tag matrix. Considering the significance of user social relation for microblog recommendation, a user--user social relation similarity matrix is constructed. Moreover, an iterative updating scheme is developed to get the final tag-user matrix for computing the similarities between microblogs and users. We illustrate the capability of our algorithm by making experiments on real microblog datasets. Experimental results show that the algorithm is effective for microblog recommendation.},

Clearly, the similarity matrix generated from the original dataset is susceptible to the noise features. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive discriminant analysis for semi-supervised feature selection, namely, SADA. Instead of computing a similarity matrix first, SADA simultaneously learns an adaptive similarity matrix S and a projection matrix W with an iterative process. Moreover. we introduce the ℓ2,p norm to control the sparsity of S by adjusting p. Experimental results show that S will become sparser with the decrease of p. The experimental results for synthetic datasets and nine benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of SADA, in comparison with 6 semi-supervised feature selection methods.},

Its main objective is to alleviate the major drawbacks of the state-of-the-art CLTC approaches -- typically based on the machine translation (MT) of documents, which are represented as bags of words (BoW). We propose a technique called cross-language concept matching (CLCM), to convert concept-based representations of documents from one language to another using Wikipedia correspondences between concepts in different languages and thus not relying on automated full-text translations. We describe two proposals: the first proposal consists in the use of the WikiBoC representation in conjunction with the CLCM technique (WikiBoC-CLCM) to classify documents written in a language L1 by using a SVM algorithm that was trained with documents written in another language L2; the second proposal consists of a hybrid model for representing documents that combines WikiBoC-CLCM with the classic BoW-MT approach. To evaluate the two proposals we conducted several experiments with three cross-lingual corpora: the JRC-Acquis corpus and two purpose-built corpora composed of Wikipedia articles. The first proposal outperforms state-of-the-art approaches when training sequences are short, achieving performance increases up to 233.33%. The second proposal outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in the whole range of training sequences, achieving performance increases up to 23.78%. Results obtained show the benefits of the WikiBoC-CLCM approach, since concepts extracted from documents add useful information to the classifier, thus improving its performance.},

To overcome the limitations of ERSs with the offline setting, we propose a novel online setting for ERSs and devise an effective model called O3ERS in this online setting, which can perform online learning with good scalability and rigorous theoretical guides for better online recommendations and online explanations. O3ERS also addresses two challenging problems in real scenarios, namely, the sparsity and delay of online explanations' feedback as well as the partialness and insufficiency of online recommendations' feedback. Specifically, O3ERS not only instantly leverages the knowledge learned from the recommendations' feedback to adjust the sparse and delayed explanations' feedback for better explanations but also utilizes a novel exploitation--exploration strategy that incorporates the explanations' feedback to adjust the partial and insufficient recommendations' feedback for better recommendations. Our theoretical analysis and empirical studies on one simulated and two real-world datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in online scenarios remarkably.},

	abstract = {Facing the increasingly fierce competition, app developers have to update features of their products continually. In this process, developers need to not only consider users' demands but also pay attention to what other similar apps do so that they can stay one step ahead in the competition. App stores provide large-scale useable data for achieving this goal while how to use them efficiently becomes a new challenge for developers. In this paper, we aim at helping developers make feature updating strategies of their apps by analyzing data of similar products in App stores. Firstly, we identify similar apps by using texts in app descriptions and UI. Then, we gain and integrate the information of updated features in these apps from their release texts. Furthermore, we match reviews with the related updated features, which helps developers predict the payback if they adopt a similar updating strategy. To validate the proposed approach, we conducted a series of experiments based on Google Play. The results show that our approach can analyze the data reasonably and provide useful information for developers making feature updating strategy in the evolution of their own products.},

	abstract = {Diabetes and its complications have been recognized worldwide as a major public health threat. Predicting diabetic complications is regarded as a highly effective technique for increasing the survival rate of diabetic patients. While many studies currently use medical images and structured medical records, very limited efforts have been dedicated to applying data mining techniques for unstructured textual medical records, such as admission and discharge records. Moreover, the similarities among medical records that are overlooked by existing approaches could potentially improve the accuracy of prediction models. In this paper, we propose an approach for diabetic complication prediction based on a similarity-enhanced latent Dirichlet allocation (seLDA) model. Specifically, we first estimate the similarity between textual medical records after data preprocessing, and then we perform seLDA-based diabetic complication topic mining based on similarity constraints. Finally, we construct a prediction model by solving a multilabel classification problem with support vector machines (SVMs). The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the conventional LDA-based approach in similarity indices by 22.49%. Additionally, our approach shows significant improvements in prediction accuracy over four other representative seLDA-based approaches, including random forests (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression (LR) and deep neural networks (DNNs).},

	abstract = {With the explosive growth of short documents generated from streaming textual sources (e.g., Twitter), latent topic discovery has become a critical task for short text stream clustering. However, most online clustering models determine the probability of producing a new topic by manually setting some hyper-parameter/threshold, which becomes barrier to achieve better topic discovery results. Moreover, topics generated by using existing models often involve a wide coverage of the vocabulary which is not suitable for online social media analysis. Therefore, we propose a nonparametric model (NPMM) which exploits auxiliary word embeddings to infer the topic number and employs a ``spike and slab'' function to alleviate the sparsity problem of topic-word distributions in online short text analyses. NPMM can automatically decide whether a given document belongs to existing topics, measured by the squared Mahalanobis distance. Hence, the proposed model is free from tuning the hyper-parameter to obtain the probability of generating new topics. Additionally, we propose a nonparametric sampling strategy to discover representative terms for each topic. To perform inference, we introduce a one-pass Gibbs sampling algorithm based on Cholesky decomposition of covariance matrices, which can further be sped up using a Metropolis-Hastings step. Our experiments demonstrate that NPMM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

This approach fails to capture semantic similarities between sentences when they express a similar information but have few words in common and are thus lexically dissimilar. To overcome this issue, we propose to extract semantic similarities based on topical representations of sentences. Inspired by the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, we propose a topic model to infer topic distributions of sentences. As each topic defines a semantic connection among sentences with a certain degree of membership for each sentence, we propose a fuzzy hypergraph model in which nodes are sentences and fuzzy hyperedges are topics. To produce an informative summary, we extract a set of sentences from the corpus by simultaneously maximizing their relevance to a user-defined query, their centrality in the fuzzy hypergraph and their coverage of topics present in the corpus. We formulate an algorithm building on the theory of submodular functions to solve the associated optimization problem. A thorough comparative analysis with other graph-based summarizers demonstrates the superiority of our method in terms of content coverage of the summaries.},

Experiments show that TE-GSDMM outperforms other topic models in generating high-quality service representation vectors for service clustering.

	abstract = {As high-resolution remote-sensing (HRRS) images have become increasingly widely available, scene classification focusing on the smart classification of land cover and land use has also attracted more attention. However, mainstream methods encounter a severe problem in that many annotation samples are required to obtain an ideal model for scene classification. In the remote sensing community, there is no dataset with a comparative scale to ImageNet (which contains over 14 million images) to meet the sample requirements of the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods. In addition, labeling new images is both labor intensive and time consuming. To address these problems, we present a new generative adversarial network (GAN)-based remote-sensing image generation method (GAN-RSIGM) that can be applied to create high-resolution annotated samples for scene classification. In GAN-RSIGM, the Wasserstein distance is used to measure the difference between the generator distribution and the real data distribution. This addresses the problem of the gradient disappearing during sample generation, and distinctly promotes a generator distribution close to the real data distribution. An auxiliary classifier is added to the discriminator, guiding the generator to produce consistent and distinct images. With regard to the network structure, the discriminator and the generator are implemented by stacking residual blocks, which further stabilize the training process of the GAN-RSIGM. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed method with two public HRRS datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method could achieve satisfactory performance for high-quality annotation sample generation, scene classification, and data augmentation.},

The query set is generalized by ``lifting'' it to one or more ``head subjects'' in the higher ranks of the taxonomy. The head subjects should cover the query set, with the possible addition of some ``gaps'', taxonomy nodes covered by the head subject but irrelevant to the query set. To decrease the numbers of gaps, we admit some ``offshoots'', nodes belonging to the query set but not covered by a head subject. The method globally minimizes the total number of head subjects, gaps and offshoots, each suitably weighted. Our algorithm is applied to the structural analysis and description of a collection of 17,685 abstracts of research papers published in 17 Springer journals related to Data Science for the 20-year period 1998--2017. Our taxonomy of Data Science (TDS) is extracted from the Association for Computing Machinery Computing Classification System 2012 (ACM-CCS), a six-level hierarchical taxonomy manually developed by a team of ACM experts. The TDS also includes a number of additional leaves that we added to cater for recent developments not represented in the ACM-CCS taxonomy. We find fuzzy clusters of leaf topics over the text collection, using specially developed machinery. Three of the clusters are indeed thematic, relating to the Data Science sub-areas of (a) learning, (b) information retrieval, and (c) clustering. These three clusters are then lifted in the TDS using ParGenFS, which allows us to draw some conclusions about tendencies in developments in these areas.},

Genetic algorithms were used to optimise models through feature selection and hyperparameter optimisation. A variety of features was found to be informative, including token and character ngram bags-of-words, presence of salient suicide-related terms and features based on LSA topic models and polarity lexicons. The results indicate that text classification is a viable and promising strategy for detecting suicide-related and alarming messages, with F-scores comparable to human annotators (93% for relevant messages, 70% for severe messages). Both types of messages can be detected with high precision and minimal noise, even on large high-skew corpora. This suggests that they would be fit for use in a real-world prevention setting.},

	abstract = {Sentence representation approaches have been widely used and proven to be effective in many text modeling tasks and downstream applications. Many recent proposals are available on learning sentence representations based on deep neural frameworks. However, these methods are pre-trained in open domains and depend on the availability of large-scale data for model fitting. As a result, they may fail in some special scenarios, where data are sparse and embedding interpretations are required, such as legal, medical, or technical fields. In this paper, we present an unsupervised learning method to exploit representations of sentences for some closed domains via topic modeling. We reformulate the inference process of the sentences with the corresponding contextual sentences and the associated words, and propose an effective context-enhanced process called the bi-Directional Context-enhanced Sentence Representation Learning (bi-DCSR). This method takes advantage of the semantic distributions of the nearby contextual sentences and the associated words to form a context-enhanced sentence representation. To support the bi-DCSR, we develop a novel Bayesian topic model to embed sentences and words into the same latent interpretable topic space called the Hybrid Priors Topic Model (HPTM). Based on the defined topic space by the HPTM, the bi-DCSR method learns the embedding of a sentence by the two-directional contextual sentences and the words in it, which allows us to efficiently learn high-quality sentence representations in such closed domains. In addition to an open-domain dataset from Wikipedia, our method is validated using three closed-domain datasets from legal cases, electronic medical records, and technical reports. Our experiments indicate that the HPTM significantly outperforms on language modeling and topic coherence, compared with the existing topic models. Meanwhile, the bi-DCSR method does not only outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods on closed domain sentence classification tasks, but also yields competitive performance compared to these established approaches on the open domain. Additionally, the visualizations of the semantics of sentences and words demonstrate the interpretable capacity of our model.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the amount of user-generated contents (UGCs) or texts has surged exponentially. Therefore, recognizing emotions from these texts can bring about lots of advantages. In this paper, we have proposed a novel model named Deep Rolling to predict emotion for target participant in a multi-participant communication context. First, the proposed method converts a text collection into a set of n-dimension vectors for emotion representation and re-organizes texts into a sequence in time order. Then, Deep Rolling can predict the emotion of target participant corresponding to a future time point. Second, apart from simply taking in texts posted by target participant via LSTM, the proposed method has also incorporated texts posted by other participants at every time step by CNN. In this way, Deep Rolling can predict target participant's emotion by processing emotions from both the target and all the other participants in an ensemble way. Finally, data factorization has also been introduced into Deep Rolling to enhance the overall prediction efficiency. According to experimental results, compared with the state-of-art methods, our proposed model has achieved the best prediction precision on different target participants. At the same time, Deep Rolling has also maintained the prediction efficiency at an acceptable level.},

	abstract = {To solve the big topic modeling problem, we need to reduce both the time and space complexities of batch latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithms. Although parallel LDA algorithms on multi-processor architectures have low time and space complexities, their communication costs among processors often scale linearly with the vocabulary size and the number of topics, leading to a serious scalability problem. To reduce the communication complexity among processors to achieve improved scalability, we propose a novel communication-efficient parallel topic modeling architecture based on a power law, which consumes orders of magnitude less communication time when the number of topics is large. We combine the proposed communication-efficient parallel architecture with the online belief propagation (OBP) algorithm, referred to as POBP, for big topic modeling tasks. Extensive empirical results confirm that POBP has the following advantages for solving the big topic modeling problem when compared with recent state-of-the-art parallel LDA algorithms on multi-processor architectures: (1) high accuracy, (2) high communication efficiency, (3) high speed, and (4) constant memory usage.},

A large number of conventional approaches, which have exploited handcrafted features with traditional classifiers, cannot learn high-level spatiotemporal features to precisely recognize complex human actions. In this paper, we introduce a novel encoding technique, namely Pose-Transition Feature to Image (PoT2I), to transform skeleton information to image-based representation for deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The spatial joint correlations and temporal pose dynamics of an action are exhaustively depicted by an encoded color image. For learning action models, we fine-tune end-to-end a pre-trained network to thoroughly capture multiple high-level features at multi-scale action representation. The proposed method is benchmarked on several challenging 3D action recognition datasets (e.g., UTKinect-Action3D, SBU-Kinect Interaction, and NTU RGB+D) with different parameter configurations for performance analysis. Outstanding experimental results with the highest accuracy of 90.33% on the most challenging NTU RGB+D dataset demonstrate that our action recognition method with PoT2I outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important application field of evolutionary algorithm. Unlike traditionly anomaly detection, group anomaly detection aims to discover the anomalous aggregate behaviors in data points. Over past decades, a large number of promising methods have been successfully applied for group anomaly detection. However, they inherently neglect the correlations among groups in data points, limiting their abilities. This paper presents a correlated hierarchical generative model, which can model the intricate correlations hidden in groups by introducing a logistic normal distribution to capture the correlations among groups. With the proposed model, we construct a full variational Bayesian framework, which can data-adaptively optimize the model parameters of the proposed model. The model is designed and trained using Genetic Algorithm (GA), which helps automating the use of generative model. Further, a new score function is proposed as an anomaly criterion to estimate final anomaly groups in data points. Several experiments on synthetic data and real astronomical star data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method compared with the-state-of-art methods, in terms of average accurac (AP) and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC) curve(AUC).},

By analyzing user behavior, we discover the differences between driving factors and quantify their driving strength. First, four factors that influence the user's behavior are proposed, including explicit links (E), implicit links (I), personal interest (P), and a random factor (R). In particular, based on a cloud model, an implicit link creation method is designed. This method can quantify the driving strength of the implicit relation between users, and avoid the multiple attribute weighting defects in subjective and objective aspects. Next, considering the maximum likelihood estimation theory, a user behavior influence model (EIPR) of a hotspot topic is proposed to measure the causes of user behavior behind the social hotspots. Experimental results show that the model can be used to find different dynamic factors of user behavior in social hot topics. Among these external factors, the implicit link plays an significantly important role in driving user behavior.},

Recently, attackers have initiated increasingly coordinated attack activities commonly pertaining to botnets. However, how to effectively detect the botnet based on attacker activities is proven challenging. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-based method for modeling attacker activities based on the following intuitive observations: attackers in the same botnet tend to launch temporally close attacks. We then directly model attack temporal patterns using a special class of point process called Multivariate Hawkes Process. Intuitively, Multivariate Hawkes Process identifies the latent influences between attackers by utilizing the mutually exciting properties. We then cluster the attacker activities based on the inferred weighted influence matrix with resort to the graph-based clustering approach. To evaluate the applicability of our method, we deployed 10 honeypots in a real-world environment, and conduct experiments on the collected dataset. The results show that we can identify the activity pattern and the structure of botnets effectively.},

Modeling activity events and their rich relations using high-level human understandable activity models such as semantic-based knowledge base hold promise. However, formulas in current semantic-based approaches are generally manually encoded, which is rather unrealistic in situations where event relations are intricate. Moreover, current approaches for learning event relations often lack the capability to handle uncertainties. To address these issues, we present a framework to learn an event knowledge base (EKB) of probabilistic interval-based event relations and use them to infer varied semantic-level queries about activity occurrences under uncertainty. Specifically, we formalize an activity model to represent eight temporal and hierarchical event relations and four commonly performed queries. We leverage pattern mining techniques to learn an EKB associated with these relations and queries in a unified way. Experimental results show that the proposed framework with the learned EKB involving temporal and hierarchical dependencies leads to a significant performance improvement on activity recognition, particularly in the presence of incomplete or incorrect observations.},

In this research, we develop a hierarchical interest overlapping community (HIOC) detection method and present a personalized recommendation model. First, content interest closeness and semantic interest closeness between user profiles are computed to measure multi-granularity subject similarity of users. Then, using the multi-granularity subject similarity and follow similarity of users, a heterogeneous hypergraph is constructed to represent an interest network. By application of the interest density peaks mechanism, the HIOC detection method is adopted for identifying communities of interest. Further, personalized interest prediction is implemented by consideration of the memberships of a user in a community and a subject distributed in a community. Finally, we verify the performance of the HIOC detection algorithm on several real networks and validate the effectiveness of the proposed recommendation approach.

	abstract = {Many real-world networks contain multiple types of interactions and relations. Link prediction in such multi-relational networks has become an important area in network analysis. For link prediction in multi-relational networks, we should consider the similarity and influence between different types of relations. In this paper, we propose a link prediction algorithm in multi-relational networks based on relational similarity. In the algorithm, a belief propagation method is presented to calculate the belief of each node and to construct the belief vector for each type of link. We use the similarity between belief vectors to measure the influence between different types of relations. Based on the influence between different relations, we present a nonnegative matrix factorization -based method for link prediction in multi-relational networks. The convergence and correctness of the presented method are proved. Our experimental results show that our method can achieve higher-quality prediction results than other similar algorithms.},

	abstract = {Traditional topic classification usually adopts the closed-world assumption that all the test topics have been seen in training. However, in open dynamic environments, the potential new topics may appear in testing due to the evolution of text data over time. Considering the uncertainty and multi-granularity of dynamic text data, such open topic classification needs to detect unseen topics by mining the boundary region continually, and incrementally update the previous models by knowledge accumulation. To address these challenge issues, this paper introduces a unified framework of three-way multi-granularity learning to open topic classification based on the fusion of three-way decision and granular computing. First, we propose the multilevel granular structure of tasks from the temporal-spatial multi-granularity perspective. Then, we construct an adaptive decision boundary and use the centroids and the corresponding radius to discover unknowns by the reject option. Subsequently, we further explore the unknown topics by three-way enhanced clustering and the uncertain instances will be re-investigated in the next stage. Besides, we design a built-in knowledge base represented as the centroid of each topic to store the topic knowledge. Finally, the experiments are conducted to compare the performances of proposed models and the efficiency of knowledge accumulation with classic models.},

	abstract = {Link prediction is one of the core problems in social network analysis. Considering the complexity of features in social networks, we propose a link prediction method based on feature representation and fusion. Firstly, based on the sparseness and high-dimensionality of network structure, network embedding is applied to represent the network structure as low-dimensional vectors, which identifies the spatial relationships and discovers the relevance among users. Second, owing to the diversity and complexity of text semantics, the user text is converted into vectors by word embedding models. As user behaviors can reflect the dynamic change of links, a time decay function is introduced to process the text vector to quantify the impact of user text on link establishment. Meanwhile, to simplify the complexity, we choose the top-k relevant users for each user. Finally, due to the attention mechanism can improve the expression of user's interests in text information, a link prediction method with attention-based convolutional neural network is proposed. By fusing and mining structural and text features, the purpose of synthetically predict link is finally achieved. Experimental results show that the proposed model can effectively improve the performance of link prediction.},

Traditional expert finding methods mainly exploit topic analysis and authority calculation methods to identify high-quality experts in certain fields. To avoid recommending questions to those experts who do not display the willingness or ability to provide high-quality answers, user interest drift and user quality should be considered. This study proposes a novel method named high-quality domain expert finding in CQA based on multi-granularity semantic analysis and interest drift (HQExpert). Firstly, HQExpert considers different semantic granularities by employing two models, a coarse-grained topic model LC-LDA and a fine-grained model (BERT), to capture the domain information of questions and users more accurately. Secondly, to address the diverse interests of the users, a user interest drift model in HQExpert is developed to dynamically represent the changes in the interests of the users at different periods. In addition, a user quality model is developed to further optimize the professional level of the user, finding experts who can provide high-quality answers and are interested in the current question. Finally, extensive experiments on two datasets from different domains demonstrate that the proposed HQExpert model can significantly improve the accuracy of finding high-quality experts.},

	abstract = {Traffic classification has been widely used in networking and security issues. Previous works have involved many different techniques for mapping traffic to the application. However, little attention has been paid to traffic classification for dynamic network stream. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Multiple Traffic Classification System (DMTCS). We first introduce the time-based distribution of the traffic protocol information to the traffic classification problem, as the traffic data is a data stream with time continuity. The packets are treated as documents and protocols are seen as topics. Thus, we can apply topic models to cluster packets. In our system, after initialization, packets arrived at a time point are classified as of some protocols. Then, these packets are assembled to clusters according to the protocol distribution at the last time point. Finally, we use these clusters to classify packets arrived at the next time point. Our method has several advantages: 1) does not require the prior knowledge of target applications; 2) tolerant with both TCP and UDP protocols; 3) support multiple classification; 4) preserve high accuracy for the traffic stream with dynamic and imbalanced traffic distribution. Evaluations on DMTCS are carried on two different datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that DMTCS has an impressive performance in classification on the real-world network stream and the dynamic simulation stream. Whats more, DMTCS outperforms other state-of-the-art models in our experiment.},

	abstract = {The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, which is a document-level probabilistic model, has been widely used in topic modeling. However, an essential issue of the LDA is its shortage in identifying co-occurrence relationships (e.g., aspect-aspect, aspect-opinion, etc.) in sentences. To address the problem, we propose an association constrained LDA (AC-LDA) for effectively capturing the co-occurrence relationships. Specifically, based on the basic features of the syntactic structure in product reviews, we formalize three major types of word association combinations and then carefully design corresponding identifications. For reducing the influence of global aspect words on the local distribution, we apply an important constraint on global aspects. Finally, the constraint and related association combinations are merged into the LDA to guide the topic-words allocation in the learning process. Based on the experiments on real-world product review data, we demonstrate that our model can effectively capture the relationships hidden in local sentences and further increase the extraction rate of fine-grained aspects and opinion words. Our results confirm the superiority of the AC-LDA over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the extraction accuracy. We also verify the strength of our method in identifying irregularly appeared terms, such as non-aspect opinions, low-frequency words, and secondary aspects.},

It detects opinions from structured, semi-structured, and unstructured social media contents at different levels, such as the document, word, sentence, and aspect levels. In all these levels except aspect, opinion mining identifies the overall subjectivity or sentiment polarities. An aspect level is described as a part or an attribute of an entity. It exactly describes people's likes and dislikes in social media contents. In this paper, we propose a new framework for ranking products based on aspects. First, the system identifies the aspects of products. Second, the aspects and their opinion words are identified and visualized from the products' reviews using a Harel--Koren fast multiscale layout. Third, the network visualization is constructed and modeled, and a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient based opinion ranking method is applied to rank the products based on positive and negative ranks. Fourth, the supervised learning methods (Na{\"\i}ve Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machine) are employed for the aspect-based sentiment classification task.

Traditional techniques have generally relied on references and other metadata, while text mining approaches based on title and abstract text have appeared more frequently in recent years. In principle, topic models have great potential in this domain. But, in practice, they are often difficult to employ successfully, and are notoriously inconsistent as latent space dimension grows. In this manuscript we identify the three properties all usable topic models should have: robustness, descriptive power and reflection of reality. We develop a novel method for evaluating the robustness of topic models and suggest a metric to assess and benchmark descriptive power as number of topics scale. Employing that procedure, we find that the neural-network-based paragraph embedding approach seems capable of providing statistically robust estimates of the document--document similarities, even for topic spaces far larger than what is usually considered prudent for the most common topic model approaches.},

However, raw publication counts and raw citation count-based scholar performance assessment indicators, such as H-index or author citations, have shortcomings; for example, they ignore the impact of different citation patterns under different research topics, leading to authorship credit inflation due to full citation allocation to each author in multi-author publications. This study proposes a new scholar performance assessment indicator called the normalized scholar academic productivity (NSAP) indicator, which overcomes the issues posed by raw citation counts and publication counts-related scholar performance indicators by considering diverse aspects of scholar research achievements. The NSAP indicator considers the research topic, author sequence and author role in the author list, field-normalized journal impact when allocating citation counts to scholars, and published time. The research topic is generated by the co-keyword embedding and semantic relatedness of each keyword in order to make NSAP topic-dependent; the author sequence and role affect authorship credit allocation strategy; and field-normalized journal impact was used to assign different weights on raw publication counts and citation counts. Finally, awardees of the Derek de Solla Price Memorial Medal and the Association for Information Science and Technology's awards were used to evaluate the validity of NSAP for calculating scholar performance assessment. Results reveal outstanding topic-related scholar performance assessment properties compared to raw citation count indicators, such as H-index, author citations, and cited-by counts (i.e., total number of citing authors).},

	abstract = {In the modern world, science and technology jointly determine the evolutionary path of scientific innovation, with an increasingly close relationship between them. Therefore, it is important to study the identification method of the innovation path, based on the linkage of topics in science and technology. This study focuses on connected topics utilizing bibliometric analysis, thereby exploring the identification method for innovation paths based on the linkage of scientific and technological topics. The internal mechanism of knowledge dissemination and the relationship between science and technology are revealed and described in detail by measuring the linkage of knowledge units. For practical bibliometric analyses, research papers and patent literature were used to characterize scientific research and technological research to reveal the innovation path for the interaction of science and technology quantitatively, automatically, and visually. Experimental study shows that analysis of the topic-linked path of science and technology, along with the integration of multi-relationships, can effectively identify important science- and technology-related topics in a field in the evolution process, and help grasp the key points of basic research and applied research.},

However, most researches on book assessment focus on measuring academic value of books (e.g. citations analysis) or identifying attitudes of readers (e.g. book review mining), depth and breadth reflected by book contents is neglected. Therefore, in this paper, we measure books' depth and breadth by mining books' tables of contents, so as to enrich resources and methods for book assessment research, help users understand book contents quickly and improve efficiency of book selection. Specifically, we measured books' depth and breadth based on books' tables of contents via two levels: topic level and feature level. Firstly, we obtained topic-level metrics by identifying topics expressed in tables of contents and calculating topic distributions. Then, we got feature-level results via feature extraction and feature distribution calculation. Finally, we compared depth and breadth metrics and other book assessment metrics. Experimental results reveal that, books' depth and breadth at two levels are different, and substantial differences between disciplines and book types are obvious. In addition, books' depth and breadth can provide alternative and supplementary information for assessing multi-dimensional values of books.},

	abstract = {This study aims at representing research patterns of bibliographic entities (e.g., scholars, papers, and venues) with a fixed-length vector. Bibliographic network structures rooted in the entities are incredibly diverse, and this diversity increases in the outstanding entities. Thus, despite their significant volume, the outstanding entities obtain minimal learning opportunities, whereas low-performance entities are over-represented. This study solves the problem by representing the patterns of the entities rather than depicting individual entities in a precise manner. First, we describe structures rooted in the entities using the Weisfeiler--Lehman (WL) relabeling process. Each subgraph generated by the relabeling process provides information on the scholars, kinds of papers they published, standards of venues in which the papers were published, and types of their collaborators. We assume that a subgraph depicts the research patterns of bibliographic entities, such as the preference of a scholar in choosing either a few highly impactful papers or numerous papers of moderate impact. Then, we simplify the subgraphs according to multiple levels of detailedness. Original subgraphs represent the individuality of the entities, and simplified subgraphs represent the entities sharing the same research patterns. In addition, simplified subgraphs balance the learning opportunities of high- and low-performance entities by co-occurring with both types of entities. We embed the subgraphs using the Skip-Gram method. If the results of the embedding represent the research patterns of the entities, the obtained vectors should be able to represent various aspects of the research performance in both the short-term and long-term durations regardless of the performances of the entities. Therefore, we conducted experiments for predicting 23 performance indicators during four time periods for four performance groups (top 1%, 5%, 10%, and all entities) using only the vector representations. The proposed model outperformed the existing network embedding methods in terms of both accuracy and variance.},

@article{AMON2022101284,
	abstract = {In competitive research environments, scholars have a natural interest to maximize the prestige associated with their scientific work. In order to identify factors that might help them address this goal more effectively, the scientometric literature has tried to link linguistic and meta characteristics of academic papers to the associated degree of scientific prestige, conceptualized as cumulative citation counts. In this paper, we take an alternative approach that instead understands scientific prestige in terms of the rankings of the journals that the articles appeared in, as such rankings are routinely used as surrogate research quality indicators. For the purpose of determining the most important drivers of suchlike prestige, we use state-of-the-art text mining tools to extract 344 interpretable features from a large corpus of over 200,000 journal articles in economics. We then estimate beta regression models to investigate the relationship between these predictors and a cross-sectionally standardized version of SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) in multiple topically homogeneous clusters. In so doing, we also reinvestigate the bafflegab theory, according to which more prestigious research papers tend to be less readable, in a methodologically novel way. Our results show the consistently most informative predictors to be associated with the length of the paper, the span of coreference chains in its full text, the deployment of a personal and moderately informal writing style, the ``density'' of the article in terms of sentences per page, international and institutional collaboration in research teams and the references cited in the paper. Moreover, we identify various linguistic intricacies that matter in the association between readability and scientific prestige, which suggest this relationship to be more complicated than previously assumed.},

To address this need, our study developed a robust supervised machine learning approach in combination with graph community detection methods to disambiguate author names in the Web of Science publication database. We used the unique author identifier Researcher ID to retrieve true authorship data of 1,904 scientists and trained a random forest and a logistic regression classifier on 1.2 million corresponding publication pairs with authors that share the same last name and first name initial. To do this, we reviewed a vast set of paper and author characteristics and randomly included missing data to make our machine learning robust to quality changes of new publication data. In the application on an unseen test set, we achieved F1 scores of 0.82 in the random forest and 0.75 in the logistic regression model. Subsequently, we evaluate feature performance and apply the infomap graph community detection algorithm to identify all publications belonging to an author. The community detection results in reasonable cluster metrics (Mean K-Metric in logistic regression-based model = 0.78 and = 0.81 in random forest-based model). Finally, we test our algorithm on a large surname-initial block (``Muller, M.'') and demonstrate speed and predictive performance.},

	abstract = {The effective representation of the relationship between the documents and their contents is crucial to increase classification performance of text documents in the text classification. Term weighting is a preprocess aiming to represent text documents better in Vector Space by assigning proper weights to terms. Since the calculation of the appropriate weight values directly affects performance of the text classification, in the literature, term weighting is still one of the important sub-research areas of text classification. In this study, we propose a novel term weighting (MONO) strategy which can use the non-occurrence information of terms more effectively than existing term weighting approaches in the literature. The proposed weighting strategy also performs intra-class document scaling to supply better representations of distinguishing capabilities of terms occurring in the different quantity of documents in the same quantity of class. Based on the MONO weighting strategy, two novel supervised term weighting schemes called TF-MONO and SRTF-MONO were proposed for text classification. The proposed schemes were tested with two different classifiers such as SVM and KNN on 3 different datasets named Reuters-21578, 20-Newsgroups, and WebKB. The classification performances of the proposed schemes were compared with 5 different existing term weighting schemes in the literature named TF-IDF, TF-IDF-ICF, TF-RF, TF-IDF-ICSDF, and TF-IGM. The results obtained from 7 different schemes show that SRTF-MONO generally outperformed other schemes for all three datasets. Moreover, TF-MONO has promised both Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 results compared to other five benchmark term weighting methods especially on the Reuters-21578 and 20-Newsgroups datasets.},

	abstract = {Policy documents have become increasingly valuable in the field of bibliometrics because they contain important information such as the intentions and behaviors of policymakers. Policy instruments are the central elements of policy documents; therefore, identifying core policy instruments can help researchers in the field better understand the important methodological measures taken by government organizations to achieve specific economic or social goals. However, existing identification methods often focus on the effectiveness of a policy instrument along one dimension (e.g., economic indicators), while ignoring the relationship between individual policy instruments. This paper attempts to fill this gap by designing a network-based framework incorporating structural holes theory to identify the core policy instruments implied in the policy documents. We first identify ``policy target-policy instrument'' patterns in relevant policy documents and then establish a ``policy target-policy instrument'' network that maps onto real-world policy systems. Finally, using structural holes theory, we identify core policy instruments and analyze the policy mix system upon this basis. We use China's nuclear energy policy as a case study to evaluate the proposed approach. Our proposed method is useful for quantitatively analyzing complex policy systems and for identifying core policy instruments and targets within them.},

Conventional citation analysis does not consider the context of citations, which limits the understanding of interdisciplinary knowledge integration. This study introduces a novel analytical framework to characterize interdisciplinary knowledge integration by both the content, i.e., integrated knowledge phrases (IKPs), and location of citances (i.e., citing sentences) in addition to citations. Seven knowledge categories are used to classify IKPs, including Research Subject, Theory, Research Methodology, Technology, Human Entity, Data, and Others. The eHealth field is explored as an exemplar interdisciplinary field in the case study. The result reveals that the ranks of source disciplines quantified by the integrated knowledge phrases are different from those by citations, especially in terms of average knowledge integration density. The distributions of the IKPs over the knowledge categories differ among source disciplines, indicating their different contributions to knowledge integration of eHealth field. The knowledge from adjacent disciplines is integrated into the field faster than that from other disciplines. Knowledge distributions over sections of articles are also different among source disciplines, and a correlation between knowledge categories and the sections they were used is observed. The analytical framework offers a way to better understand an interdisciplinary field by disclosing the characteristics of interdisciplinary knowledge integration from the perspective of knowledge content and usage.},

Large investments in research can yield a tremendous outcome in terms of a country's overall wealth and strength. However, public financial resources of countries are often limited which calls for a wise and targeted investment. Scientific publications are considered as one of the main outputs of research investment. Although the general trend of scientific publications is increasing, a detailed analysis is required to monitor the research trends and assess whether they are in line with the top research priorities of the country. Such focused monitoring can shed light on scientific activities evolution as well as the formation of new research areas, thus helping governments to adjust priorities, if required. But monitoring the output of the funded research manually is not only very expensive and difficult, it is also subjective. Using structural topic models, in this paper we evaluated the trends in academic research performed by federally funded Canadian researchers during the time-frame of 2000--2018, covering more than 140,000 research publications. The proposed approach makes it possible to objectively and systematically monitor research projects, or any other set of documents related to research activities such as funding proposals, at large-scale. Our results confirm the accordance between the performed federally funded research projects and the top research priorities of Canada.},

Previous empirical explorations of these questions have examined the evolution of co-authorship networks associated with several fields of science, each noting a characteristic shift in network structure as fields develop. Historically, however, such studies have tended to rely on manually annotated datasets and therefore only consider a handful of disciplines, calling into question the universality of the observed structural signature. To overcome this limitation and test the robustness of this phenomenon, we use a comprehensive dataset of over 189,000 scientific articles and develop a framework for partitioning articles and their authors into coherent, semantically related groups representing scientific fields of varying size and specificity. We then use the resulting population of fields to study the structure of evolving co-authorship networks. Consistent with earlier findings, we observe a global topological transition as the co-authorship networks coalesce from a disjointed aggregate into a dense giant connected component that dominates the network. We validate these results using a separate, complimentary corpus of scientific articles, and, overall, we find that the previously reported characteristic structural evolution of a scientific field's associated co-authorship network is robust across a large number of scientific fields of varying size, scope, and specificity. Additionally, the framework developed in this study may be used in other scientometric contexts in order to extend studies to compare across a larger range of scientific disciplines.},

Thus, this study proposes an inventor profile mining approach for identifying such human resources. The proposed approach is as follows: 1) collecting patent data related to a target firm and preprocessing candidate inventors' patents; 2) identifying the inventors' technology fields and measuring their invention performance and career; 3) generating performance-career portfolio maps for invention fields to identify prospective inventors aligned with the target firm's technology development directions. We show that this approach can identify prospective inventors through a case study and statistical validation. This approach is expected to be used as a human resources management tool by technology-based firms to help them identify and scout young and talented human resources the most suitable for technology strategies.},

	abstract = {Although the gender gap in academia has narrowed, females are underrepresented within some fields in the USA. Prior research suggests that the imbalances between science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields may be partly due to greater male interest in things and greater female interest in people, or to off-putting masculine cultures in some disciplines. To seek more detailed insights across all subjects, this article compares practising US male and female researchers between and within 285 narrow Scopus fields inside 26 broad fields from their first-authored articles published in 2017. The comparison is based on publishing fields and the words used in article titles, abstracts, and keywords. The results cannot be fully explained by the people/thing dimensions. Exceptions include greater female interest in veterinary science and cell biology and greater male interest in abstraction, patients, and power/control fields, such as politics and law. These may be due to other factors, such as the ability of a career to provide status or social impact or the availability of alternative careers. As a possible side effect of the partial people/thing relationship, females are more likely to use exploratory and qualitative methods and males are more likely to use quantitative methods.

	abstract = {Topic emergence detection aids in pinpointing prominent topics within a given domain, providing practical insights into all interested parties on where to focus the limited resources. This paper employs the network-based topic evolution approach to overcome limitations in text-based topic evolution, providing prospective topic emergence prediction capabilities by representing emergent topics by their ancestors. A descendant-aware clustering algorithm is proposed to generate non-exhaustive and overlapping clusters, utilizing the pace of collaborations and structural similarities between topics with iterative edge removal and addition processes. Over 100 datasets specific to a research topic were extracted from the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset for the experiments, where the proposed algorithm consistently outperformed existing clustering algorithms in generating clusters with a higher likelihood of being ancestors to an emergent topic up to three years in the future. Regression-based cluster filtering using five structural cluster features and topic cluster qualities showed that the prediction performance can be enhanced by automatically classifying undesirable clusters from previously known data. The results showed that the proposed algorithm can enhance topic emergence predictions on a wide range of research domains regardless of their maturities, popularities, and magnitudes without having access to the data in the predicted year, paving a road to prospective predictions on emergent topics.},

This paper proposes a novel kernel k-means clustering method incorporated with a word embedding model to create a solution that effectively extracts topics from bibliometric data. The experimental results of a comparison of this method with four clustering baselines (i.e., k-means, fuzzy c-means, principal component analysis, and topic models) on two bibliometric datasets demonstrate its effectiveness across either a relatively broad range of disciplines or a given domain. An empirical study on bibliometric topic extraction from articles published by three top-tier bibliometric journals between 2000 and 2017, supported by expert knowledge-based evaluations, provides supplemental evidence of the method's ability on topic extraction. Additionally, this empirical analysis reveals insights into both overlapping and diverse research interests among the three journals that would benefit journal publishers, editorial boards, and research communities.},

The authors propose an alternative topic modeling method conscious of the topical correlation in the academic domain by introducing the notion of the common interest authors (CIA11CIA: Common Interest Authors), defining a topic as a set of shared common research interests of a researcher group. Publication records related to the Human Computer Interaction field were extracted from the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset, with virtual reality as the target field of research. The result showed that the proposed alternative topic modeling is capable of successfully model coherent topics regardless of the topic size with only the meta-data of the document set, indicating that the alternative approach is not only capable of allowing topic correlation analysis during the topic evolution but also able to generate coherent topics at the same time.},

	abstract = {Main Path Analysis (MPA) is widely used to trace the developmental trajectory of a technological field through a citation network. The citation-based traversal weight is usually utilized to cherry-pick the most significant path. However, the theme of documents along a main path may not be so coherent, and it is very possible to miss the main paths of significant sub-fields overall in a domain. Furthermore, the global path search algorithm in conventional MPA also suffers from high space complexity due to the exhaustive strategy. To address these limitations, a new method, named as semantic MPA (sMPA), is proposed by leveraging semantic information in two steps of candidate path generation and main path selection. In the meanwhile, the resulting source code can be freely accessed. To demonstrate the advantages of our method, extensive experiments are conducted on a patent dataset pertaining to lithium-ion battery in electric vehicle. Experimental results show that our sMPA is capable of discovering more knowledge flows from important sub-fields, and improving the topical coherence of candidate paths as well.},

To address the issue, this study suggests taking the level of relevance among documents into consideration. For demonstration purposes, the level of relevance is determined by similarity in both citation structure and key phrases among documents. The approach not only achieves convergence of development trajectories, but also helps frame the topics on the main paths to a specific concept from a wide range of research domains.

We consider three main aspects of trajectory analysis when analyzing the represented documents through the extracted paths: emergence, authority, and topic dynamics. For path extraction, we adopt the longest path algorithm that consists of the following three steps: 1) topological sort, 2) edge relaxation, and 3) multiple path extraction. For topic integration into multiple paths, we employ latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) by utilizing the topic-document matrix that LDA derives to select an article's topic from the citation network, where each article is labeled with the topic that is assigned with the highest topical probability for that article.

	abstract = {Author cocitation analysis (ACA) is a branch of bibliometrics and knowledge representation that aims to map knowledge domains. However, ACA has been criticized because count-based measurement is too simple, and resulting maps are insufficiently informative. Since different scholarly relationships, e.g., coauthorship and author bibliographic coupling relationships, can extract out different relationships among authors in various perspectives, combining them with ACA for constructing knowledge domain mappings is our major purpose. The proposed method constructs the hybrid matrix from all relationships in four steps: relationship normalization, calculating the similarity between scholarly relationships, calculating adjustment parameters, and constructing hybrid relationships. The important parameters for integrating these matrices are calculated according to the distance in the hyperspace transformed from the similarity among the scholarly relationships by exploratory factor analysis. Compared with ACA, the results of the proposed method show: (1) More sub-fields in the given discipline can be identified when combining other scholarly relationships; (2) The more scholarly relationships added into ACA, the more details in terms of research area the method will find; (3) Good visualization in clustering is depicted when we combine other scholarly relationships. As a result, the proposed method offers a good choice to understand researchers and to map knowledge domains in a study field for integrating more scholarly relationships at the same time.},

Topic modeling uncovered 15 dominant research topics in the literacy field, as well as their up-and-down trends from 2000 to 2021. For each topic, keywords were then replaced with disciplines, and interdisciplinarity was measured using four indices: variety, balance, disparity, and diversity. Finally, the interdisciplinarity of each topic, connectivity between topics, and topic trends were comprehensively analyzed on the keyword co-occurrence network. Our methodology reaches beyond connectivity limited to a few disciplines and provides insight into the direction of collaboration between disciplines centered on a research domain. Moreover, the study's deep keyword generation model has methodological implications for forming a corpus spanning numerous disciplines as a bottom-up approach.},

However, traditional methods assume that the disciplinary structure is flat with only one-layer topics, rather than a tree-like structure with hierarchical topics, which leads to the inability of existing methods to effectively examine the details of the evolution, such as the interactions between different research directions. In this paper, we take artificial intelligence (AI) as a case in which we study its hierarchical structural evolution, more precisely inspecting disciplinary development, by analyzing 65,887 AI-related research papers published during a 10-year period from 2009 to 2018. From a hierarchical topic model that can construct a topic-tree with multi-layer organizations, we design a visual analysis model for the topic-tree to systematically and visually investigate how knowledge transfers along the topic-tree and how the topic-tree changes over time. Moreover, some assistant indicators are employed to help in the exploration of the complicated structural evolution. Then, we discover the latent relationship between the sub-structures within a topic as well as the triggering reason for the knowledge migration. Based on these results, we conclude that different topics have different development patterns and that the recent artificial intelligence revolution stems from the interactions among the different topics.},

	abstract = {As the Internet confronts the multimedia explosion, it becomes urgent to investigate personalized recommendation for alleviating information overload and improving users' experience. Most personalized recommendation approaches pay their attention to collaborative filtering over users' interactions, which suffers greatly from the highly sparse interactions. In image recommendation, visual correlations among images that users consumed provide a piece of intrinsic evidence to reveal users' interests. It inspires us to investigate image recommendation over the dense visual graph of images instead of the sparse user interaction graph. In this paper, we propose a semantic manifold modularization-based ranking (MMR) for image recommendation. MMR leverages the dense visual manifold to propagate users' historical records and infer user-image correlations for image recommendation. Especially, it constrains interest propagation within semantic visual compact groups by manifold modularization to make a tradeoff between users' personality and graph smoothness in propagation. Experimental results demonstrate that user-consumed visual correlations play actively to capture users' interests, and the proposed MMR can infer user-image correlations via visual manifold propagation for image recommendation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a feature description method called semantic descriptor with objectness (SDO) for scene recognition. Most existing scene representation methods exploit the characteristics of constituent objects in scenes with inter-class independence, which ignore the negative effects caused by the common objects among different scenes. The generic characteristics of the common objects cause some generality among different scenes, which weakens the discriminative characteristics among scenes. To address this problem, we exploit the correlations of object configurations among different scenes by the co-occurrence pattern of all objects across scenes to choose representative and discriminative objects which enhances the inter-class discriminability. Specifically, we capture the statistic information of objects appearing in each scene to compute the distribution of each object across scenes, which obtains the co-occurrence pattern of objects. Moreover, we represent the image descriptors with the occurrence probabilities of discriminative objects in image patches to eliminate the negative effects of common objects. To make image descriptors more discriminative, we discard the patches with non-discriminative objects to enhance the intra-class generalized characteristics. Experimental results on three widely used scene recognition datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

Then, these features are organized in temporal-semantic documents to later be embedded into a topic models space. Finally, Dynamic-Time-Warping and Spectral-Clustering methods are used for final day routine/non-routine discrimination. Moreover, we introduce a new EgoRoutine-dataset, a collection of 104 egocentric days with more than 100.000 images recorded by 7 users.

Solving this task requires reasoning and understanding of visual modality, language modality, and common sense knowledge to answer. Various architectures have been proposed to solve this task by variants of multi-modal deep learning techniques that combine visual and language representations. However, we believe that it is crucial to understand and analyze the sources of uncertainty for solving this task. Our approach allows for estimating uncertainty and also aids a diverse generation of answers. The proposed approach is obtained through a probabilistic representation module that provides us with representations for image, question and conversation history, a module that ensures that diverse latent representations for candidate answers are obtained given the probabilistic representations and an uncertainty representation module that chooses the appropriate answer that minimizes uncertainty. We thoroughly evaluate the model with a detailed ablation analysis, comparison with state of the art and visualization of the uncertainty that aids in the understanding of the method. Using the proposed probabilistic framework, we thus obtain an improved visual dialog system that is also more explainable.},

	abstract = {The recent proliferation of advertising (ad) videos has driven the research in multiple applications, ranging from video analysis to video indexing and retrieval. Among them, classifying ad video is a key task because it allows automatic organization of videos according to categories or genres, and this further enables ad video indexing and retrieval. However, classifying ad video is challenging compared to other types of video classification because of its unconstrained content. While many studies focus on embedding ads relevant to videos, to our knowledge, few focus on ad video classification. In order to classify ad video, this paper proposes a novel ad video representation that aims to sufficiently capture the latent semantics of video content from multiple views in an unsupervised manner. In particular, we represent ad videos from four views, including bag-of-feature (BOF), vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD), fisher vector (FV) and object bank (OB). We then devise a multi-layer multi-view topic model, mlmv_LDA, which models the topics of videos from different views. A topical representation for video, supporting category-related task, is finally achieved by the proposed method. Our empirical classification results on 10,111 real-world ad videos demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively differentiate ad videos.},

In this study, we propose a new concept decomposition method that creates concept vectors by identifying semantic word communities from a weighted word co-occurrence network extracted from a short text corpus or a subset thereof. The cluster memberships of short texts are then estimated by mapping the original short texts to the learned semantic concept vectors. The proposed method is not only robust to the sparsity of short text corpora but also overcomes the curse of dimensionality, scaling to a large number of short text inputs due to the concept vectors being obtained from term-term instead of document-term space. Experimental tests have shown that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.},

A three-layer example is the author-paper-word structure in which authors are linked by co-author relation, papers are linked by citation relation, and words are linked by semantic relation. Network embedding, which aims to project the nodes in the network into a relatively low-dimensional space for latent factor analysis, has recently emerged as an effective method for a variety of network-based tasks, such as collaborative filtering and link prediction. However, existing studies of network embedding both focus on the single-layer network and overlook the structural properties of the network, e.g., the degree distribution and communities, which are significant for node characterization, such as the preferences of users in a social network. In this paper, we propose four multilayer network embedding algorithms based on Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with consideration given to four structural properties: whole network (NNMF), community (CNMF), degree distribution (DNMF), and max spanning tree (TNMF). Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed algorithms are able to preserve the desired structural properties as designed. Experiments on real-world data show that multilayer network embedding improves the accuracy of document clustering and recommendation, and the four embedding algorithms corresponding to the four structural properties demonstrate the differences in performance on these two tasks. These results can be directly used in document clustering and recommendation systems.},

	abstract = {Solving a supervised learning problem requires to label a training set. This task is traditionally performed by an expert, who provides a label for each sample. The proliferation of social web services (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) has introduced an alternative crowdsourcing approach. Anybody with a computer can register in one of these services and label, either partially or completely, a dataset. The effort of labeling is then shared between a great number of annotators. However, this approach introduces scientifically challenging problems such as combining the unknown expertise of the annotators, handling disagreements on the annotated samples, or detecting the existence of spammer and adversarial annotators. All these problems require probabilistic sound solutions which go beyond the naive use of majority voting plus classical classification methods. In this work we introduce a new crowdsourcing model and inference procedure which trains a Gaussian Process classifier using the noisy labels provided by the annotators. Variational Bayes inference is used to estimate all unknowns. The proposed model can predict the class of new samples and assess the expertise of the involved annotators. Moreover, the Bayesian treatment allows for a solid uncertainty quantification. Since when predicting the class of a new sample we might have access to some annotations for it, we also show how our method can naturally incorporate this additional information. A comprehensive experimental section evaluates the proposed method with synthetic and real experiments, showing that it consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art crowdsourcing approaches.},

	abstract = {Human activity recognition has been actively studied in the last three decades. Compared to human action performed by a single person, human interaction is more complex due to the involvement of more subjects and the interdependence between them. Recently, motivated by the remarkable success of deep learning techniques, many learning-based feature representations have been developed for activity recognition. This paper provides a comprehensive review of human action and interaction recognition methods, covering both hand-crafted features and learning-based features, with a special focus on data captured by RGB-D sensors. Furthermore, this review reveals practical challenges in human activity analysis along with their promising solutions and potential future directions.},

	abstract = {Node clustering aims to partition the vertices in a graph into multiple groups or communities. Existing studies have mostly focused on developing deep learning approaches to learn a latent representation of nodes, based on which simple clustering methods like k-means are applied. These two-step frameworks for node clustering are difficult to manipulate and usually lead to suboptimal performance, mainly because the graph embedding is not goal-directed, i.e., designed for the specific clustering task. In this paper, we propose a clustering-directed deep learning approach, Deep Neighbor-aware Embedded Node Clustering (DNENC for short) for clustering graph data. Our method focuses on attributed graphs to sufficiently explore the two sides of information in graphs. It encodes the topological structure and node content in a graph into a compact representation via a neighbor-aware graph autoencoder, which progressively absorbs information from neighbors via a convolutional or attentional encoder. Multiple neighbor-aware encoders are stacked to build a deep architecture followed by an inner-product decoder for reconstructing the graph structure. Furthermore, soft labels are generated to supervise a self-training process, which iteratively refines the node clustering results. The self-training process is jointly learned and optimized with the graph embedding in a unified framework, to benefit both components mutually. Experimental results compared with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the good performance of our framework.},

	abstract = {Graph clustering based on embedding aims to divide nodes with higher similarity into several mutually disjoint groups, but it is not a trivial task to maximumly embed the graph structure and node attributes into the low dimensional feature space. Furthermore, most of the current advanced methods of graph nodes clustering adopt the strategy of separating graph embedding technology and clustering algorithm, and ignore the potential relationship between them. Therefore, we propose an innovative end-to-end graph clustering framework with joint strategy to handle the complex problem in a non-Euclidean space. In terms of learning the graph embedding, we propose a new variational graph auto-encoder algorithm based on the Graph Convolution Network (GCN), which takes into account the boosting influence of joint generative model of graph structure and node attributes on the embedding output. On the basis of embedding representation, we implement a self-training mechanism through the construction of auxiliary distribution to further enhance the prediction of node categories, thereby realizing the unsupervised clustering mode. In addition, the loss contribution of each cluster is normalized to prevent large clusters from distorting the embedding space. Extensive experiments on real-world graph datasets validate our design and demonstrate that our algorithm has highly competitive in graph clustering over state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Topic modeling is a powerful approach for modeling data represented as high-dimensional histograms. While the high dimensionality of such input data is extremely beneficial in unsupervised applications including language modeling and text data exploration, it introduces difficulties in cases where class information is available to boost up prediction performance. Feeding such input directly to a classifier suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Performing dimensionality reduction and classification disjointly, on the other hand, cannot enjoy optimal performance due to information loss in the gap between these two steps unaware of each other. Existing supervised topic models introduced as a remedy to such scenarios have thus far incorporated only linear classifiers in order to keep inference tractable, causing a dramatical sacrifice from expressive power. In this paper, we propose the first Bayesian construction to perform topic modeling and non-linear classification jointly. We use the well-known Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and sparse Gaussian processes for non-linear classification. We combine these two components by a latent variable encoding the empirical topic distribution of each document in the corpus. We achieve a novel variational inference scheme by adapting ideas from the newly emerging deep Gaussian processes into the realm of topic modeling. We demonstrate that our model outperforms other existing approaches such as: (i) disjoint LDA and non-linear classification, (ii) joint LDA and linear classification, (iii) joint non-LDA linear subspace modeling and linear classification, and (iv) non-linear classification without topic modeling, in three benchmark data sets from two real-world applications: text categorization and image tagging.},

A key step in an organizations business intelligence process is to cluster users with similar interests into social audiences and discover the roles they play within a business network. In this article, we propose a novel machine-learning approach, called CBIN, that co-clusters business information networks to discover and understand these audiences. The CBIN framework is based on co-factorization. The audience clusters are discovered from a combination of network structures and rich contextual information, such as node interactions and node-content correlations. Since what defines an audience cluster is data-driven, plus they often overlap, pre-determining the number of clusters is usually very difficult. Therefore, we have based CBIN on an overlapping clustering paradigm with a hold-out strategy to discover the optimal number of clusters given the underlying data. Experiments validate an outstanding performance by CBIN compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms on 13 real-world enterprise datasets.},

	abstract = {Soft computing provides the framework for dealing with the uncertainty and imprecision inherent in real-life applications. Soft computing has become a long-standing notable paradigm for medical image processing. A typical fuzzy clustering uses the fuzzy membership function. Nevertheless, there is an alternative membership representation, known as typicality or possibilistic membership. Unlike fuzzy membership that is probabilistic in nature, typicality represents an absolute membership and it is the degree of belonging of an object to a class that does not depend on its distances from the other classes. However, both fuzzy membership and typicality play important role in assigning membership to an object. This study proposes a novel clustering model that creates a vague environment enriched with the concept of fuzzy membership and typicality, while the use of type-reduction plays an essential role in capturing all the vagueness present in the data set. The proposed model is called type-reduced vague possibilistic fuzzy clustering (TVPFC), and we use MRI images to demonstrate its superior robustness over that of FCM (fuzzy c-means), PCM (possibilistic c-means), VCM (vague c-means) and IPFCM (interval-valued possibilistic fuzzy c-means).},

One key challenge of cross-modal retrieval is narrowing the heterogeneous gap across diverse modalities. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel method termed as Cross-modal discriminant Adversarial Network (CAN). Taking bi-modal data as a showcase, CAN consists of two parallel modality-specific generators, two modality-specific discriminators, and a Cross-modal Discriminant Mechanism (CDM). To be specific, the generators project diverse modalities into a latent cross-modal discriminant space. Meanwhile, the discriminators compete against the generators to alleviate the heterogeneous discrepancy in this space, i.e., the generators try to generate unified features to confuse the discriminators, and the discriminators aim to classify the generated results. To further remove the redundancy and preserve the discrimination, we propose CDM to project the generated results into a single common space, accompanying with a novel eigenvalue-based loss. Thanks to the eigenvalue-based loss, CDM could push as much discriminative power as possible into all latent directions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our CAN, comprehensive experiments are conducted on four multimedia datasets comparing with 15 state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Action recognition is a challenging task in the field of computer vision. The deficiency in training samples is a bottleneck problem in the current action recognition research. With the explosive growth of Internet data, some researchers try to use prior knowledge learned from various video sources to assist in recognizing the action video of the target domain, which is called knowledge adaptation. Based on this idea, we propose a novel framework for action recognition, called Semantic Adaptation based on the Vector of Locally Max Pooled deep learned Features (SA-VLMPF). The proposed framework consists of three parts: Two-Stream Fusion Network (TSFN), Vector of Locally Max-Pooled deep learned Features (VLMPF) and Semantic Adaptation Model (SAM). TSFN adopts a cascaded convolution fusion strategy to combine the convolutional features extracted from two-stream network. VLMPF retains the long-term information in videos and removes the irrelevant information by capturing multiple local features and extracting the features with the highest response to action category. SAM first maps the data of the auxiliary domain and the target domain into the high-level semantic representation through the deep network. Then the obtained high-level semantic representations from auxiliary domain are adapted into target domain in order to optimize the target classifier. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed methods can utilize the advantages of deep learning methods in obtaining the high-level semantic information to improve the performance of knowledge adaptation. At the same time, SA-VLMPF can make full use of the auxiliary data to make up for the insufficiency of training samples. Multiple experiments are conducted on several couples of datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed SA-VLMPF outperforms the state-of-the-art knowledge adaptation methods.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) is a popular data analysis method with the objective to discover the underlying semantic structure of input data. In this work, we describe a method for probabilistic topic analysis in image and text based on a new representation of graph-regularized PLSA (GPLSA). In GPLSA, data entities are mapped to an undirected graph, where similarities between topic compositions on the graph are measured by the divergence between discrete probabilities. Such divergence is essentially incorporated as a graph-regularizer that augments the original PLSA algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the GPLSA algorithms to multiple data modalities based on the connections between data entities of each modality. We propose efficient multiplicative iterative algorithms for GPLSA with three popular regularizers, namely ℓ1, ℓ2 and symmetric KL divergences. In each case, we derive simple efficient numerical solutions that require only matrix arithmetic operations during the optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of GPLSA over state-of-the-art methods.},

Besides, existing learn-to-rank methods cannot explicitly predict the purchase possibility for a specific user-item pair. In this paper, we propose a two-step graph-based model, where the graph model is applied in the first step to learn representations of both users and items over click-through data, and the second step is a classifier incorporating the price information of each transaction record. To evaluate the model performance, we propose a transaction-based framework focusing on the purchased items and their context clicks, which contain items that a user is interested in but fails to choose after comparison. Our experiments show that exploiting the price and discount information can significantly enhance prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {Person re-identification problem is targeting to match people in the views of non-overlapped camera networks. It is an important task in the fields of computer vision and video surveillance. It shows great value in applications like surveillance and action recognition. Existing metric learning based methods measure the similarity of sample pairs by learning a metric space in which the positive pairs are closer than negative pairs. However, the appearance features undergo with drastic variation. Person re-identification is a typical small sample problem. It is hard to learn a robust projection of metric subspace that takes all the situations into consideration. The learned metric subspace is usually over-fitting to training dataset due to the strict metric learning constraint. And the hard pairs in training dataset will weaken the discrimination of matching pairs' similarity. To address these problems, a feedback mechanism based iterative metric learning method is proposed. The proposed method introduces a mean distance of multi-metric subspace to deal with the over-fitting problem. The joint discriminant optimal model on feedback top ranks matching pairs will enhance the discrimination of matching pairs' similarity. It is a robust and discriminative distance metric which measures the matching pairs similarity with distances of multiple metric projections learned by a set of training datasets. Aiming to learn the multi-metric subspace, the proposed method gives a feedback mechanism based approach which back propagates the top ranks identification results as pseudo training datasets. The effectiveness of proposed mean distance of multi-metric projection is analyzed and proved theoretically. And extensive experiments on three challenging datasets, VIPeR, GRID and CUHK01 are conducted. The results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance and improves the state-of-the-art rank-1 identification rates by 18.48%, 2.00% and 5.41% on three datasets respectively.},

	abstract = {Datasets are often collected from different resources or comprised of multiple representations (i.e., views). Multi-view clustering aims to analyze the multi-view data in an unsupervised way. Owing to the efficiency of uncovering the hidden structures of data, graph-based approaches have been investigated widely for various multi-view learning tasks. However, similarity measurement in these methods is challenging since the construction of similarity graph is impacted by several factors such as the scale of data, neighborhood size, choice of similarity metric, noise and outliers. Moreover, nonlinear relationships usually exist in real-world datasets, which have not been considered by most existing methods. In order to address these challenges, a novel model which simultaneously performs multi-view clustering task and learns similarity relationships in kernel spaces is proposed in this paper. The target optimal graph can be directly partitioned into exact c connected components if there are c clusters. Furthermore, our model can assign ideal weight for each view automatically without additional parameters as previous methods do. Since the performance is often sensitive to the input kernel matrix, the proposed model is further extended with multiple kernel learning ability. With the proposed joint model, three subtasks including construct the most accurate similarity graph, automatically allocate optimal weight for each view and find the cluster indicator matrix can be simultaneously accomplished. By this joint learning, each subtask can be mutually enhanced. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-view clustering algorithms.},

The lexicon is composed of a set of semantic poses, a set of visual poses and a probabilistic mapping between the visual and semantic poses. Specially, an action can be represented by a sequence of semantic poses extracted from an associated textual instruction. Visual frames of the action are considered to be generated from a sequence of hidden visual poses. To learn the lexicon, a visual pose model is learned from training samples by a Gaussian Mixture model to characterize the likelihood of an observed visual frame being generated by a visual pose. A pose lexicon model is also learned by an extended hidden Markov alignment model to encode the probabilistic mapping between hidden visual poses and semantic poses sequences. With the lexicon, action classification is formulated as a problem of finding the maximum posterior probability of a given sequence of visual frames that fits to a given sequence of semantic poses through the most likely visual pose and alignment sequences. The efficacy of the proposed method was evaluated on MSRC-12, WorkoutSU-10, WorkoutUOW-18, Combined-15 and Combined-17 action datasets using cross-subject, cross-dataset and zero-shot protocols.},

	abstract = {Multimodal hashing methods have gained considerable attention in recent years due to their effectiveness and efficiency for cross-modal similarity searches. Existing multimodal hashing methods either learn unified hash codes for different modalities or learn individual hash codes for each modality and then explore cross-correlations between them. Generally, learning unified hash codes tends to preserve the shared properties of multimodal data and learning individual hash codes tends to preserve the specific properties of each modality. There remains a crucial bottleneck regarding how to learn hash codes that simultaneously preserve the shared properties and specific properties of multimodal data. Therefore, we present a joint and individual matrix factorization hashing (JIMFH) method, which not only learns unified hash codes for multimodal data to preserve their common properties but also learns individual hash codes for each modality to retain its specific properties. The proposed JIMFH learns unified hash codes by joint matrix factorization, which jointly factorizes all modalities into a shared latent semantic space. In addition, JIMFH learns individual hash codes by individual matrix factorization, which separately factorizes each modality into a modal-specific latent semantic space. Finally, unified hash codes and individual hash codes are combined to obtain the final hash codes. In this way, hash codes learned by JIMFH can preserve both the shared properties and specific properties of multimodal data, and therefore the retrieval performance is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed JIMFH performs much better than many state-of-the-art methods on cross-modal retrieval applications.},

Visual ambiguities caused by variations in view angle, lighting, and occlusions make the re-identification problem extremely challenging. To overcome the ambiguities, most previous approaches often extract robust feature representations or learn a sophisticated feature transformation. However, most of these approaches ignore the effect of the impostors arising from annotation or tracking process. In this case, impostors are regarded as genuine and applied in training process, leading to the model drift problem. In order to reduce the risk of model drifting, we propose to automatically discover impostors in a multiple instance metric learning framework. Specifically, we propose a kNN based confidence score to evaluate how much an impostor invades the interested target and utilize it as a prior in the framework. In the meanwhile, we integrate an impostor rejection mechanism in the multiple instance metric learning framework to automatically discover impostors, and learn the semantical similarity metrics with the refined training set. Experiments show that the proposed system performs favorably against the state-of-the-art algorithms on two challenging datasets (iLIDS-VID and PRID 2011).

Existing studies mainly focus on modeling the content of multi-modal documents, whilst the links amongst documents are commonly ignored. However, link information has shown being of key importance in many applications, such as document navigation, classification, and clustering. In this paper, we present a non-probabilistic formulation of Relational Topic Model (RTM), i.e., Sparse Relational Multi-Modal Topical Coding (SRMMTC), to model both multi-modal documents and the corresponding link information. SRMMTC has the following three appealing properties: i) It can effectively produce sparse latent representations via directly imposing sparsity-inducing regularizers. ii) It handles the imbalance issues on multi-modal data collections by introducing regularization parameters for positive and negative links, respectively; iii) It can be solved by an efficient coordinate descent algorithm. We also explore a generalized version of SRMMTC to find pairwise interactions amongst topics. Our methods are also capable of performing link prediction for documents, as well as the prediction of annotation words for attendant images in documents. Empirical studies on a set of benchmark datasets show that our proposed models significantly outperform many state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {In the era of User Generated Content (UGC), authors (IDs) of texts widely exist and play a key role in determining the topic categories of texts. Existing text clustering efforts are mainly attributed to utilizing textual information, but the effect of authors on text clustering remains largely underexplored. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel Contrastive Author-aware Text clustering approach, dubbed as CAT. CAT injects author information not only in characterizing texts through representations but also in pushing or pulling text representations of different authors through contrastive learning, which is rarely adopted by text clustering. Specifically, the developed contrastive learning method conducts both cluster-instance contrast by the text representation augmentation and instance-instance contrast by the multi-view representations. We perform comprehensive experiments on three public datasets, demonstrating that CAT largely outperforms strong competitive text clustering baselines and validating the effectiveness of the CAT's main components.},

	abstract = {Owing to advances in information technology, online communications between people living in different parts of the world have considerably increased. The subsequent emergence of social networks helped this kind of communications to be further organized. One of the most important issues considered when analyzing these kinds of networks is community detection, in which a majority of studies tend to detect disjoint communities through analyzing linkages of networks. What this paper aims to achieve is to obtain overlapping communities in which the members have the same topics of interest, and where the strengths of connections between them are the consequence of their communications' content analysis. Consequently, we have hereby proposed a generic framework for overlapping community detection in social networks with special focus on rating-based social networks. This framework considers the information shared by the users (ratings), as well as their topics of interest, for the sake of finding meaningful communities. This will lead us to topical communities in which members are interested in the same topics, and the strengths of their relationships are directly based on the rate of their viewpoints' unity. Quantitative evaluations also reveal that the framework presented in this study achieves favorable results which are quite superior to the results of 3 other relevant frameworks in the literature.},

	abstract = {Online activity recognition which aims to detect and recognize activity instantly from a continuous video stream is a key technology in human-robot interaction. However, the partial activity observation problem, mainly due to the incomplete sequence acquisition, makes it greatly challenging. This paper proposes a novel approach, named Multi-stage Adaptive Regression (MAR), for online activity recognition with the main focus on addressing the partial observation problem. Specifically, the MAR framework delicately assembles overlapped activity observations to improve its robustness against arbitrary activity segments. Then multiple score functions corresponding to each specific performance stage are collaboratively learned via a adaptive label strategy to enhance its power of discriminating similar partial activities. Moreover, the Online Human Interaction (OHI) database is constructed to evaluate the online activity recognition in human interaction scenarios. Extensive experimental evaluations on the Multi-Modal Action Detection (MAD) database and the OHI database show that the MAR method achieves an outstanding performance over the state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {In recent years, image annotation has attracted extensive attention due to the explosive growth of image data. With the capability of describing images at the semantic level, image annotation has many applications not only in image analysis and understanding but also in some relative disciplines, such as urban management and biomedical engineering. Because of the inherent weaknesses of manual image annotation, Automatic Image Annotation (AIA) has been raised since the late 1990s. In this paper, a deep review of state-of-the-art AIA methods is presented by synthesizing 138 literatures published during the past two decades. We classify AIA methods into five categories: 1) Generative model-based image annotation, 2) Nearest neighbor-based image annotation, 3) Discriminative model-based image annotation, and 4) Tag completion-based image annotation, 5) Deep Learning-based image annotation. Comparisons of the five types of AIA methods are made on the basis of the underlying idea, main contribution, model framework, computational complexity, computation time, and annotation accuracy. We also give an overview of five publicly available image datasets and four standard evaluation metrics commonly used as benchmarks for evaluating AIA methods. Then the performance of some typical or well-behaved models is assessed based on benchmark dataset and standard evaluation metrics. Finally, we share our viewpoints on the open issues and challenges in AIA as well as research trends in the future.},

	abstract = {Graph convolutional network (GCN) is an effective neural network model for graph representation learning. However, standard GCN suffers from three main limitations: (1) most real-world graphs have no regular connectivity and node degrees can range from one to hundreds or thousands, (2) neighboring nodes are aggregated with fixed weights, and (3) node features within a node feature vector are considered equally important. Several extensions have been proposed to tackle the limitations respectively. This paper focuses on tackling all the proposed limitations. Specifically, we propose a new node-feature convolutional (NFC) layer for GCN. The NFC layer first constructs a feature map using features selected and ordered from a fixed number of neighbors. It then performs a convolution operation on this feature map to learn the node representation. In this way, we can learn the usefulness of both individual nodes and individual features from a fixed-size neighborhood. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that NFC-GCN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification.},

	abstract = {In large-scale visual recognition tasks, researchers are usually faced with some challenging problems, such as the extreme imbalance in the number of training data between classes or the lack of annotated data for some classes. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture that automatically synthesizes pseudo feature representations for the classes in lack of annotated images. With the supply of semantic attributes for classes, the proposed Attribute-Based Synthetic Network (ABS-Net) can be applied to zero-shot learning (ZSL) scenario and conventional supervised learning (CSL) scenario as well. For ZSL tasks, the pseudo feature representations can be viewed as annotated feature-level instances for novel concepts, which facilitates the construction of unseen class predictor. For CSL tasks, the pseudo feature representations can be viewed as products of data augmentation on training set, which enriches the interpretation capacity of CSL systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ABS-Net in ZSL and CSL settings on a synthetic colored MNIST dataset (C-MNIST). For several popular ZSL benchmark datasets, our architecture also shows competitive results on zero-shot recognition task, especially leading to tremendous improvement to state-of-the-art mAP on zero-shot retrieval task.},

	abstract = {Sequence labeling is a fundamental task in natural language processing and has been widely studied. Recently, RNN-based sequence labeling models have increasingly gained attentions. Despite superior performance achieved by learning the long short-term (i.e., successive) dependencies, the way of sequentially processing inputs might limit the ability to capture the non-continuous relations over tokens within a sentence. To tackle the problem, we focus on how to effectively model successive and discrete dependencies of each token for enhancing the sequence labeling performance. Specifically, we propose an innovative attention-based model (called position-aware self-attention, i.e., PSA) as well as a well-designed self-attentional context fusion layer within a neural network architecture, to explore the positional information of an input sequence for capturing the latent relations among tokens. Extensive experiments on three classical tasks in sequence labeling domain, i.e.,  part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition (NER) and phrase chunking, demonstrate our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-arts without any external knowledge, in terms of various metrics.},
