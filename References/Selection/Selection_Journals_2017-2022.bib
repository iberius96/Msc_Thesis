@article{chen_2020_a_topic_sensitive_trust_evaluation_approach_for_users_in_online_communities,
	abstract = {In order to facilitate human decision making, trust evaluation has received widespread attention in many fields, especially for online services. Most of the existing methods consider trust in a person as a value which does not vary across different scenarios without any attention to the distinction of domains or communities where trust is derived. However, the notion of context is a significant and indispensable factor for trust evaluation in practice. Due to the lack of the consideration of context, traditional methods cannot resolve the issue that arises when a highly trustworthy person in one domain is likely to dominate the results of trust assessment in others where the person is in fact less authoritative. To solve this problem, in this paper, we develop a general approach to accomplish topic-sensitive trust evaluation by considering the context of trust. We first propose a general framework which presents the well-organized architecture of topic-sensitive trust evaluation in online communities. Then, a user-topic model is proposed to automatically extract topic data from user-generated content based on the Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LLDA) model. To compare the topic differences between users, we design a topic coverage function for revealing their trust relationships in diverse topics. Moreover, we employ two traditional methods and extend them to accomplish trust prediction for people with multiple domain knowledge. Experiments based on a real-world dataset show that extended topic-sensitive approaches are more adaptive and accurate than those topic-free trust evaluation approaches, especially when the trust application scenario features multiple topics.},

@article{zhang_2017_detecting_and_predicting_the_topic_change_of_knowledge_based_systems_a_topic_based_bibliometric_analysis_from_1991_to_2016,
	abstract = {The journal Knowledge-based Systems (KnoSys) has been published for over 25 years, during which time its main foci have been extended to a broad range of studies in computer science and artificial intelligence. Answering the questions: ``What is the KnoSys community interested in?'' and ``How does such interest change over time?'' are important to both the editorial board and audience of KnoSys. This paper conducts a topic-based bibliometric study to detect and predict the topic changes of KnoSys from 1991 to 2016. A Latent Dirichlet Allocation model is used to profile the hotspots of KnoSys and predict possible future trends from a probabilistic perspective. A model of scientific evolutionary pathways applies a learning-based process to detect the topic changes of KnoSys in sequential time slices. Six main research areas of KnoSys are identified, i.e., expert systems, machine learning, data mining, decision making, optimization, and fuzzy, and the results also indicate that the interest of KnoSys communities in the area of computational intelligence is raised, and the ability to construct practical systems through knowledge use and accurate prediction models is highly emphasized. Such empirical insights can be used as a guide for KnoSys submissions.},

@article{chen_2019_experimental_explorations_on_short_text_topic_mining_between_lda_and_nmf_based_schemes,
	abstract = {Learning topics from short texts has become a critical and fundamental task for understanding the widely-spread streaming social messages, e.g., tweets, snippets and questions/answers. Up to date, there are two distinctive topic learning schemes: generative probabilistic graphical models and geometrically linear algebra approaches, with LDA and NMF being the representative works, respectively. Since these two methods both could uncover the latent topics hidden in the unstructured short texts, some interesting doubts are coming to our minds that which one is better and why? Are there any other more effective extensions? In order to explore valuable insights between LDA and NMF based learning schemes, we comprehensively conduct a series of experiments into two parts. Specifically, the basic LDA and NMF are compared with different experimental settings on several public short text datasets in the first part which would exhibit that NMF tends to perform better than LDA; in the second part, we propose a novel model called ``Knowledge-guided Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Better Short Text Topic Mining'' (abbreviated as KGNMF), which leverages external knowledge as a semantic regulator with low-rank formalizations, yielding up a time-efficient algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on three representative corpora with currently typical short text topic models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed KGNMF. Overall, learning with NMF-based schemes is another effective manner in short text topic mining in addition to the popular LDA-based paradigms.},

@article{alp_2018_identifying_topical_influencers_on_twitter_based_on_user_behavior_and_network_topology,
	abstract = {Social media web sites have become major media platforms to share personal information, news, photos, videos and more. Users can even share live streams whenever they want to reach out to many other. This prevalent usage of social media attracted companies, data scientists, and researchers who are trying to infer meaningful information from this vast amount of data. Information diffusion and maximizing the spread of words is one of the most important focus for researchers working on social media. This information can serve many purposes such as; user or content recommendation, viral marketing, and user modeling. In this research, finding topical influential/authority users on Twitter is addressed. Since Twitter is a good platform to spread knowledge as a word of mouth approach and it has many more public profiles than protected ones, it is a target media for marketers. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology, called Personalized PageRank, that integrates both the information obtained from network topology and the information obtained from user actions and activities in Twitter. The proposed approach aims to determine the topical influencers who are experts on a specific topic. Experimental results on a large dataset consisting of Turkish tweets show that using user specific features like topical focus rate, activeness, authenticity and speed of getting reaction on specific topics positively affects identifying influencers and lead to higher information diffusion. Algorithms are implemented on a distributed computing environment which makes high-cost graph processing more efficient.},

@article{alp_2019_influence_factorization_for_identifying_authorities_in_twitter,
	abstract = {Prevalent usage of social media attracted companies and researchers to analyze its dynamics and effects on user behavior. One of the most intriguing aspects of social networks is to identify influencers who are experts on a specific topic. With the identification of these users within the network, many applications can be built for user recommendation, information diffusion modeling, viral marketing, user modeling and many more. In this paper, we aim to identify topic-based experts using a large dataset collected from Twitter. Our proposed approach has three phases: (1) identification of topics on social media posts (more specifically, tweets), (2) user modeling, based on a group of user specific features, and (3) Influence Factorization to identify topical influencers. The main advantage of the proposed method is to identify future influencers as well as current ones on Twitter. Moreover, it is an easy to implement algorithm using Spark MLlib, which can be easily extended to include other user specific features, and compare with other methodologies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on a large dataset that contains tweets of 180K user over 70 day period. The experimental results show that our proposed method identifies influencers successfully when used with a hybrid user specific feature that contains follower count and authenticity information, and is a highly scalable and extensible algorithm.},

@article{zhang_2019_learning_document_representation_via_topic_enhanced_lstm_model,
	abstract = {Document representation plays an important role in the fields of text mining, natural language processing, and information retrieval. Traditional approaches to document representation may suffer from the disregard of the correlations or order of words in a document, due to unrealistic assumption of word independence or exchangeability. Recently, long--short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural networks have been shown effective in preserving local contextual sequential patterns of words in a document, but using the LSTM model alone may not be adequate to capture global topical semantics for learning document representation. In this work, we propose a new topic-enhanced LSTM model to deal with the document representation problem. We first employ an attention-based LSTM model to generate hidden representation of word sequence in a given document. Then, we introduce a latent topic modeling layer with similarity constraint on the local hidden representation, and build a tree-structured LSTM on top of the topic layer for generating semantic representation of the document. We evaluate our model in typical text mining applications, i.e., document classification, topic detection, information retrieval, and document clustering. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the benefit of our innovations over state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

@article{ebadi_2020_application_of_machine_learning_techniques_to_assess_the_trends_and_alignment_of_the_funded_research_output,
	abstract = {Research and development activities are regarded as one of the most influencing factors of the future of a country. Large investments in research can yield a tremendous outcome in terms of a country's overall wealth and strength. However, public financial resources of countries are often limited which calls for a wise and targeted investment. Scientific publications are considered as one of the main outputs of research investment. Although the general trend of scientific publications is increasing, a detailed analysis is required to monitor the research trends and assess whether they are in line with the top research priorities of the country. Such focused monitoring can shed light on scientific activities evolution as well as the formation of new research areas, thus helping governments to adjust priorities, if required. But monitoring the output of the funded research manually is not only very expensive and difficult, it is also subjective. Using structural topic models, in this paper we evaluated the trends in academic research performed by federally funded Canadian researchers during the time-frame of 2000--2018, covering more than 140,000 research publications. The proposed approach makes it possible to objectively and systematically monitor research projects, or any other set of documents related to research activities such as funding proposals, at large-scale. Our results confirm the accordance between the performed federally funded research projects and the top research priorities of Canada.},

A text corpus of keywords was generated through a deep keyword generation model from abstracts of 346,387 articles published in 296 disciplines from 1917 to 2021. Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression topic modeling, interdisciplinarity indices, and network analysis were employed to analyze the collected corpus. Topic modeling uncovered 15 dominant research topics in the literacy field, as well as their up-and-down trends from 2000 to 2021. For each topic, keywords were then replaced with disciplines, and interdisciplinarity was measured using four indices: variety, balance, disparity, and diversity. Finally, the interdisciplinarity of each topic, connectivity between topics, and topic trends were comprehensively analyzed on the keyword co-occurrence network. Our methodology reaches beyond connectivity limited to a few disciplines and provides insight into the direction of collaboration between disciplines centered on a research domain. Moreover, the study's deep keyword generation model has methodological implications for forming a corpus spanning numerous disciplines as a bottom-up approach.},

This paper proposes a novel kernel k-means clustering method incorporated with a word embedding model to create a solution that effectively extracts topics from bibliometric data. The experimental results of a comparison of this method with four clustering baselines (i.e., k-means, fuzzy c-means, principal component analysis, and topic models) on two bibliometric datasets demonstrate its effectiveness across either a relatively broad range of disciplines or a given domain. An empirical study on bibliometric topic extraction from articles published by three top-tier bibliometric journals between 2000 and 2017, supported by expert knowledge-based evaluations, provides supplemental evidence of the method's ability on topic extraction. Additionally, this empirical analysis reveals insights into both overlapping and diverse research interests among the three journals that would benefit journal publishers, editorial boards, and research communities.},

For topic integration into multiple paths, we employ latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) by utilizing the topic-document matrix that LDA derives to select an article's topic from the citation network, where each article is labeled with the topic that is assigned with the highest topical probability for that article.

In this paper, we present an exploratory investigation of science supply and societal needs on the grand challenge of obesity -- an emerging health problem with enormous social costs. We illustrate a potential approach that uses topic modelling to explore: (a) how scientific publications can be used to describe existing priorities in science production; (b) how policy records (in this case here questions posed in the European parliament) can be used as an instance of mapping discourse of social needs; (c) how the comparison between the two may show (mis)alignments between societal concerns and scientific outputs. While this is a technical exercise, we propose that this type of mapping methods can be useful to domain experts for informing strategic planning and evaluation in funding agencies.},

@article{amon_2022_is_it_all_bafflegab____linguistic_and_meta_characteristics_of_research_articles_in_prestigious_economics_journals,
	abstract = {In competitive research environments, scholars have a natural interest to maximize the prestige associated with their scientific work. In order to identify factors that might help them address this goal more effectively, the scientometric literature has tried to link linguistic and meta characteristics of academic papers to the associated degree of scientific prestige, conceptualized as cumulative citation counts. In this paper, we take an alternative approach that instead understands scientific prestige in terms of the rankings of the journals that the articles appeared in, as such rankings are routinely used as surrogate research quality indicators. For the purpose of determining the most important drivers of suchlike prestige, we use state-of-the-art text mining tools to extract 344 interpretable features from a large corpus of over 200,000 journal articles in economics. We then estimate beta regression models to investigate the relationship between these predictors and a cross-sectionally standardized version of SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) in multiple topically homogeneous clusters. In so doing, we also reinvestigate the bafflegab theory, according to which more prestigious research papers tend to be less readable, in a methodologically novel way. Our results show the consistently most informative predictors to be associated with the length of the paper, the span of coreference chains in its full text, the deployment of a personal and moderately informal writing style, the ``density'' of the article in terms of sentences per page, international and institutional collaboration in research teams and the references cited in the paper. Moreover, we identify various linguistic intricacies that matter in the association between readability and scientific prestige, which suggest this relationship to be more complicated than previously assumed.},

@article{xu_2020_topic_linked_innovation_paths_in_science_and_technology,
	abstract = {In the modern world, science and technology jointly determine the evolutionary path of scientific innovation, with an increasingly close relationship between them. Therefore, it is important to study the identification method of the innovation path, based on the linkage of topics in science and technology. This study focuses on connected topics utilizing bibliometric analysis, thereby exploring the identification method for innovation paths based on the linkage of scientific and technological topics. The internal mechanism of knowledge dissemination and the relationship between science and technology are revealed and described in detail by measuring the linkage of knowledge units. For practical bibliometric analyses, research papers and patent literature were used to characterize scientific research and technological research to reveal the innovation path for the interaction of science and technology quantitatively, automatically, and visually. Experimental study shows that analysis of the topic-linked path of science and technology, along with the integration of multi-relationships, can effectively identify important science- and technology-related topics in a field in the evolution process, and help grasp the key points of basic research and applied research.},

@article{zhou_2022_a_weakly_supervised_graph_based_joint_sentiment_topic_model_for_multi_topic_sentiment_analysis,
	abstract = {Multi-topic sentiment analysis, which aims to identify the topics and classify their corresponding sentiment, is of great value in understanding consumers' behaviour and improving services. Because of the high cost of manual annotation of the datasets, topic model-based approaches that model the joint distributions of both topics and sentiments have been studied previously. Some studies proposed models that leverage the prior knowledge derived from the pre-trained word embeddings and have proven effective. However, most of the existing models are based on the assumption that words and topics are conditionally independent, ignoring the dependency relations among them. Additionally, the fine-tuning of the pre-trained word embeddings to incorporate the contextual information is also neglected in these models. This could result in the ambiguous representations of topics. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised graph-based joint sentiment topic model (W-GJST) that integrates an edge-gated graph convolutional network (E-GCN) into a joint sentiment-topic model. An importance sampling-based training method is proposed to learn the contextual representations of topics and words efficiently. Additionally, a self-training multi-topic classifier is designed for the multi-label topic identification. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed W-GJST compared to the baseline models in terms of topic modelling, topic identification and topic-sentiment identification.},

@article{yang_2021_author_topic_model_for_co_occurring_normal_documents_and_short_texts_to_explore_individual_user_preferences,
	abstract = {The investigation of user preferences through user comments has attracted significant attention. Although topic models have been verified as useful tools to facilitate the understanding of textual contents, they cannot be directly applied to accomplish this task because of two problems. The first problem is the severe data sparsity suffered by user comments because they are generally short. The second problem is the mixture of opinions from both user comments and the original documents the users commented on. To simultaneously solve the data sparsity problem and explore clean user preferences, we propose an author co-occurring topic model (AOTM) for normal documents and their short user comments. By considering authorship, AOTM allows each author of short texts to have a probability distribution over a set of topics represented only short texts. Accordingly, the individual user preferences can be investigated based on these author-level distributions. We verify the performance of AOTM using two news article datasets and one e-commerce dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the AOTM outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in topic learning and topic representation of documents. The potential usage of AOTM in exploring individual user preferences is further illustrated by drawing user portraits and predicting user posting behaviors.},

	abstract = {Social media offers a new communication channel for users and affords an interactive opportunity between users and the firms about the products and the brands. Understanding what topics are important to users and the corresponding internal motivation is crucial for managers to successfully engage customers and promote business through social media. Assuming topic preference is the outcome of intrinsic factors such as gender, age and personality traits, this paper proposes an improved nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian topic (NHBT) model to investigate the multiple-to-multiple generative relationships from intrinsic factors to topic preferences. The proposed NHBT model employs a three-level generation framework based on Dirichlet process to study the impact of intrinsic factors on users topic preference. Our study of Facebook data shows that NHBT model is able to draw valuable latent topics (e.g. music band, chemical biology, cosplay) from the open social media environment, and reveal the internal motivation for users topic selection behaviors (e.g. users with low conscientiousness and high extraversion personality prefer topics about campus party). Our experiments also show that NHBT model can identify the intrinsic factors dominating topic preferences for individual users, and provide foundations to predict the intrinsic factors for new user generated contents.},

However, as the quality of the topics induced by topic models greatly varies, much research effort has been devoted to their automated evaluation. Recent research has focused on topic coherence as a measure of a topic's quality. Existing topic coherence measures work by considering the semantic similarity of topic words. This makes them unfit to detect the coherence of transient topics with semantically unrelated topic words, which abound in news media texts. In this paper, we introduce the notion of document-based topic coherence and propose novel topic coherence measures that estimate topic coherence based on topic documents rather than topic words. We evaluate the proposed measures on two datasets containing topics manually labeled for document-based coherence, on which the proposed measures outperform a strong baseline as well as word-based coherence measures. We also demonstrate the usefulness of document-based coherence measures for automated topic discovery from news media texts.},

During recent years, Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) providers, such as Coursera or edX, are reporting millions of new users signing up on their platforms. Though online review systems are standard among many verticals, no standardized or fully decentralized review systems exist in the MOOC ecosystem. In this vein, we believe that there is an opportunity to leverage available open MOOC reviews in order to build simpler and more transparent reviewing systems, allowing users to really identify the best courses out there. Specifically, in our research we analyze 2.4 million reviews (which is the largest MOOC reviews dataset used until now) from five different platforms in order to determine the following: (1) if the numeric ratings provide discriminant information to learners, (2) if NLP-driven sentiment analysis on textual reviews could provide valuable information to learners, (3) if we can leverage NLP-driven topic finding techniques to infer themes that could be important for learners, and (4) if we can use these models to effectively characterize MOOCs based on the open reviews. Results show that numeric ratings are clearly biased (63% of them are 5-star ratings), and the topic modeling reveals some interesting topics related with course advertisements, the real applicability, or the difficulty of the different courses.},

Every complaint narrative provides insight into problems that consumers are experiencing. With increasing number of the CFPB complaint narratives, manual review of these documents by human experts is not feasible. This requires an intelligent system to analyze narratives automatically and provide insightful knowledge to the experts. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to analyze the CFPB consumer complaints. The proposed approach aims to extract latent topics in the CFPB complaint narratives, and explores their associated trends over time. The time trends will then be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the CFPB regulations and expectations on financial institutions in creating a consumer oriented culture. The technology-human partnership between the proposed approach and the CFPB experts could certainly improve consumer experience by providing more efficient and effective investigations of consumer complaint narratives.},

Extant literature in the expert and intelligent systems examines this issue by relying mainly on such constrained information sets. In this study, we utilize online reviews to show the information gains from the consideration of factors identified from topic modeling of unstructured data which provide a flexible extension to numerical scores to understand customer satisfaction and subsequently service quality. When numerical and textual features are combined, the explained variation in overall satisfaction improves significantly. We further present how such information can be of value for firms for corporate strategy decision-making when incorporated in an expert system that acts as a tool to perform market analysis and assess their competitive performance. We apply our methodology on airline passengers' online reviews using Structural Topic Models (STM), a recent probabilistic extension to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) that allows the incorporation of document level covariates. This innovation allows us to capture dominant drivers of satisfaction along with their dynamics and interdependencies. Results unveil the orthogonality of the low-cost aspect of airline competition when all other service quality dimensions are considered, thus explaining the success of low-cost carriers in the airline market.},

	abstract = {In this work, we cope with the classification of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in Spanish according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). We employ Topic Models representing each document as a probabilistic distribution over topics, offering a low-dimensional representation of documents. The trend is to turn to an embedding text representation, but these approaches require large amounts of textual data. We found Topic Models as a suitable alternative approach to deal with the few resources available for Spanish clinical text mining. Besides, they are interpretable and aid the explainability in artificial intelligence (XAI). We explored two different methods, known as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Partially Labelled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (PLDA), the supervised approach of the former. We assessed the results attained in Spanish with an analogous task in English as a reference. Evaluation methods were applied directly to the representation, with metrics to determine topic coherence and the relationship between topics and ICD labels. We learned that PLDA was able to discover topics associated with the ICD. This finding means that this representation itself can reveal ICD codes previous to classification. Also, this representation was used as predictive features to feed a conventional classifier to show their competence in a downstream task. We conclude that in a context with a lack of big data availability, PLDA emerges as a versatile candidate, able to offer a competitive representation of EHRs. While other works are primarily concerned with supervised categorization and do not pay attention to the representation, LDA and PLDA offer an interpretable approach that can be associated with ICDs. Moreover, compared with those that employ LDA, we demonstrate how its' supervised version, PLDA, can be more intuitive as it shows a closer relation with the ICDs.},

	abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have been widely disseminated due to the arrival of Web 2.0. However, the growth of MOOCs brings some difficulties for students in choosing suitable courses in these ecosystems. In recent years, some recommendation systems emerged to solve this problem but remain limited since they do not identify the student's prior knowledge broadly or the student's goals. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes the Fragmented Recommendation for MOOCs Ecosystems (FReME), a recommendation system to suggest parts of courses from multiple providers (i.e., Khan Academy, Udemy, and edX). FReME is based on the student profile and on the MOOCs ecosystems perspective to balance the ecological environment and strengthen interactions. Moreover, we differ from the current recommendation systems since our method identifies and reduces the students' knowledge gap optimizing the learning process. Experimental results conducted with a dataset integrating 3 MOOCs providers and 19 students demonstrated that the implemented techniques are more consistent than other approaches. Finally, it was verified through precision, utility, novelty, and confidence that our recommendations are 62,24% accurate, 68.89% useful, 72.81% reliable, and present new content in 99.12% of cases. These results validate that FReME supports students in reducing their knowledge gap.},

Although recognition works on mathematical expressions have been explored for four decades, the current literature and trends are varied and frequently influenced by distinct emerging methods and technology. This situation instigates the necessity of an organized review to provide heedful insight into research trends and patterns currently prevailing in the domain of mathematical expression recognition (MER).
Objective
To identify and associate (semantic mapping) the leading research zones, core research areas, and research trends steering in the MER domain. Identifying prominent recognition models based on extracted research areas. To develop the development chart from extracted research trends for directing the future works in this direction.
Method
A manual and automatic search has been performed across the reputed digital libraries for corpus formation. The formulated corpus is used for topic modeling, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation is deployed for information modeling for achieving defined objectives.
Result
The corpus of 325 research papers published from 1967 to 2021 has been processed using LDA. The five major research areas and ten research trends are identified. Leading research area is ``Segmentation and Classification Procedures'', and the trend with the highest related publications is ``Contextual and Graph-based recognition''. ``Attention and Deep Networks'' has emerged as the newborn trend, and the identified newborn, young, and matured trends impetrate more exploration from the MER research community.},

@article{altinel_2022_social_media_analysis_by_innovative_hybrid_algorithms_with_label_propagation,
	abstract = {Due to the huge size of the data accumulated on microblogging sites, recently, two fundamental questions have become very popular: 1) What percentage of this accumulated data has positive or negative sentiment polarity? 2) How is the distribution of this accumulated data on different topics? Inspired by these motivated necessities, this paper presents several different algorithms which are based on the Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) in order to handle previously mentioned two fundamentals tasks: sentiment polarity detection task and topic-based text classification task. These algorithms are the Label Propagated- Relevance Frequency Classifier (LP-RFC) and LP-Abstract Frequency Classifier (LP-AFC). These algorithms can be defined as new semantic smoothing classifiers, which take advantage of the semantic connections among terms in the label propagation phase of the LPA. Additionally, another classifier, namely LP-ComRFC+AFC, was built. LP-ComRFC+AFC is actually a weighted summation classifier of the individual LP-RFC and LP-AFC. Furthermore, considering the shortage of labeled data in real-world scenarios, a semi-supervised version of LP-RFC and LP-AFC, namely ``Merging Unlabeled and Labeled Instances with Semantic Values of Terms'' (MULIS), was designed and implemented. For the experiments of the sentiment polarity detection task, three different datasets were use and for the experiments of topic-based text classification task, a self-collected tweet dataset was use. According to the experimental results, the suggested algorithms, and their composite form, LP-ComRFC+AFC, generated higher F1 scores than all of the baseline algorithms at nearly all of the training splits on the datasets.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a machine learning approach involving tourists' electronic word of mouth (eWOM) to support destination marketing campaigns. This approach enhances optimisation of a critical aspect of marketing campaigns, that is, the communication of the right content to the right consumers. The proposed method further considers aggregate cultural and economic-related information of the tourists' country of origin with topic modelling and Decision Tree (DT) models. Each DT addresses different dimensions of culture and purchasing power and the way these dimensions are associated with the topics discussed in eWOM, thus revealing patterns relating tourists' experiences with potential explanations for their dissatisfaction/satisfaction. The method is implemented in a case study in the context of tourism in Cyprus focusing on two hotel groups (2/3 and 4/5 stars) to account for their differences. Patterns emerged from the extraction of rules from DTs illuminate combinations of variables associated with tourist experience (negative or positive) for each of the two hotel categories and verify the asymmetric relationship between service performance and satisfaction. The approach can be used by management during marketing campaigns to design messages to better address the desires and needs of tourists from different cultural and economic backgrounds, as these emerge from the data analysis.},

	abstract = {The abundant use of social media impacts every aspect of life, including crisis management. Disaster management needs real-time data to be used in machine learning and deep learning models to aid their decision making. Mostly the data that is newly generated from social media is unstructured and unlabeled. Current text classification models based on supervised deep learning models heavily rely on human-labeled data that very small size and imbalanced in the context of disasters, ultimately affecting the generalization of models. In this study, we propose Topic2labels (T2L) framework which provides an automated way of labeling the data through LDA (latent dirichlet allocation) topic modeling approach and utilize Bert (the bidirectional encoder representation from transformer) embeddings for construction of feature vector to be employed to classify the data contextually. Our framework consists of three layers. In the first layer, we adopt LDA to generate the topics from the data, and develop a new algorithm to rank the topics, and map the highest ranked dominant topic into label to annotate the data. In the second layer, we transform the labeled text into feature representation through Bert embeddings and in the third layer we leveraged deep learning models as classifiers to classify the textual data into multiple categories. Experimental results on crisis-related datasets show that our framework performs better in terms of classification performance and yields improvement as compared to other baseline approaches.},

Supervised approaches for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis achieve good results for the domain and language they are trained on, but manually labelling data to train supervised systems for all domains and languages is very costly and time consuming. In this work, we describe W2VLDA, an almost unsupervised system based on topic modelling that, combined with some other unsupervised methods and a minimal configuration step, performs aspect category classification, aspect-term and opinion-word separation and sentiment polarity classification for any given domain and language. We evaluate its domain aspect and sentiment classification performance in the multilingual SemEval 2016 task 5 (ABSA) dataset. We show competitive results for several domains (hotels, restaurants, electronic devices) and languages (English, Spanish, French and Dutch).},

	abstract = {Blockchain has become one of the core technologies in Industry 4.0. To help decision-makers establish action plans based on blockchain, it is an urgent task to analyze trends in blockchain technology. However, most of existing studies on blockchain trend analysis are based on effort demanding full-text investigation or traditional bibliometric methods whose study scope is limited to a frequency-based statistical analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new topic modeling method called Word2vec-based Latent Semantic Analysis (W2V-LSA), which is based on Word2vec and Spherical k-means clustering to better capture and represent the context of a corpus. We then used W2V-LSA to perform an annual trend analysis of blockchain research by country and time for 231 abstracts of blockchain-related papers published over the past five years. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to Probabilistic LSA, one of the common topic modeling techniques. The experimental results confirmed the usefulness of W2V-LSA in terms of the accuracy and diversity of topics by quantitative and qualitative evaluation. The proposed method can be a competitive alternative for better topic modeling to provide direction for future research in technology trend analysis and it is applicable to various expert systems related to text mining.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to identify the customers' primary topics of concern regarding online retail brands that are shared among Twitter users. This study collects tweets associated with five leading UK online retailers covering the period from Black Friday to Christmas and New Year's sales. We use a combination of text analytical approaches including topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and network analysis to analyse the tweets. Through the analysis, we identify that delivery, product and customer service are among the most-discussed topics on Twitter. We also highlight the areas that receive the most negative customer sentiments such as delivery and customer service. Interestingly, we also identify emerging topics such as online engagement and in-store experience that are not captured by the existing literature on online retailing. Through a network analysis, we underscore the relationships among those important topics. This study derives insights on how well the leading online retail brands are performing and how their products and services are perceived by their customers. These insights can help businesses understand customers better and enable them to convert the information into meaningful knowledge to improve their business performance. The study offers a novel approach of transforming social media data into useful knowledge about online retailing. The incorporation of three analytical approaches offers insights for researchers to understand the hidden content behind the large collections of unstructured bodies of text, and this information can be used to improve online retailing services and reach out to customers.},

	abstract = {Other than banks, non-financial companies also continuously monitor and analyze their credit risk exposure to avoid possible counterparty defaults. Credit default swaps are commonly used financial instruments that provide information on a counterparty's creditworthiness. Although this metric can provide crucial insights, the underlying price dynamics often remain unknown and require further explanation. Data-driven decision-making is a key concept for identifying these reasons and supporting and justifying decisions. In this paper, we provide such justifications by applying sentiment and topic analysis to company-related financial analyst reports. While the contents of financial news have been analyzed in the past, analyst reports can offer additional insights, as seasoned analysts use them to disseminate in-depth research to experienced investors. This analysis examines 3386 analyst reports covering constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index in the period from 2009 to 2020. The results suggest that even when established credit risk indicators and financial news are considered, the sentiment and a subset of topics are correlated with changes in the credit default swap spread, indicating a fundamental relationship between quantitative risk metric and analyst reports. We find that analyst reports contain information related to the change in credit default swap spreads, an insight that helps to improve our understanding of existing risk assessments. The outcome indicates that banks or corporate risk managers can benefit from complementing established financial metrics and even financial news data with new insights derived from analyst reports.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, platform-facilitated collaborative consumption has recently become attractive to consumers. A comparative study of consumers' online review behavior and its impact on overall satisfaction and demand in the accommodation-sharing economy and the hotel industry indicates that consumers' perceptions and behavior change gradually with changes in the level of sharing---from no sharing when staying in hotel rooms to intensive sharing when sharing rooms through collaborative consumption. Online consumer reviews focus on product and service attributes, and the influential factors of customer satisfaction and demand differ when consumers are at different accommodation-sharing levels. Not all attributes described in online reviews influence overall customer satisfaction. With a higher level of sharing, consumers' valuation changes from more to less tangible attributes. Consumers at a higher sharing level care more about social interaction and economic value than consumers at a lower sharing level. Transaction costs, particularly the information search and acquisition costs, play an important role in influencing customer purchase decisions in the sharing economy. Consumers refer to direct information for tangible attributes and to previous consumers' online reviews for intangible attributes to familiarize themselves with details before making purchase decisions. Our study provides implications that help platforms and hosts better target consumer segments with different sharing levels and more effectively utilize online reviews to generate positive electronic word of mouth to enhance consumer demand and the performance of platform economics.},

In this study, we use text mining tools to propose a method for rapid prioritization of online reviews, differentiating the reviews pertaining to innovation opportunities that are most useful for firms. We draw from the innovation and entrepreneurship literature and provide an empirical basis for the widely accepted attribute mapping framework, which delineates between desirable product attributes that firms may want to capitalize upon and undesirable attributes that they may need to remedy. Based on a large sample of reviews in the countertop appliances industry, we demonstrate the performance of our technique, which offers statistically significant improvements relative to existing methods. We validate the usefulness of our technique by asking senior managers at a large manufacturing firm to rate a selection of online reviews, and we show that the selected attribute types are more useful than alternative reviews. Our results offer insight in how firms may use online reviews to harness vital consumer feedback.},
