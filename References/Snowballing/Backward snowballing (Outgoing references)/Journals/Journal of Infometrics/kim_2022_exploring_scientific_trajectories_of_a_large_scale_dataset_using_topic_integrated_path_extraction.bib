@article{lathabai_2018_an_integrated_approach_to_path_analysis_for_weighted_citation_networks,
	abstract = {Profuse growth of scientometrics as a research field owes a discernible attribution to the introduction of citation networks and other scientograms. Centrality analysis, path analysis and cluster analysis are three major network analysis tools. Hummon and Doreian's introduction of path retrieval methods based on (1) traversal count as weight assignment (for arcs) method and (2) search methods such as local (forward) search and global search, marked the commencement of path analysis. Original Hummon--Doreian traversal count based weight assignment methods such as Search Path Link Count and Search Path Node Pair were computationally complex. Along with the computational improvement of these weights, Batagelj added another computationally efficient traversal count method to the path analysis literature known as Search Path Count. A major development in search methods was seen recently with the introduction of innovative search methods such as backward (local) search and key-route (local and global) search by Liu and Lu. They also powered the available and new local search methods with a parameter to control the search. Major advantage of Liu--Lu methods lies in the fact that these can reveal more paths or more papers that are usually missed out in classical methods. All these contributions considered unweighted citation networks as the object of analysis. Despite being a tool of tremendous potential, path analysis is much underexplored relative to other network analysis tools. Inspired by these, we generalise Liu--Lu integrated approach, the present state-of-art in path analysis to an integrated approach for weighted networks. We demonstrate a manifold improvement in analysis opportunities with the generalized integrated approach using FV gradient weights for weight assignment, on a case study of the field `IT for engineering'. Integrated approach for weighted networks do not need additional implementation effort in PAJEK and this will be beneficial for a multitude of analysts and decision makers.},

@article{liu_2019_a_few_notes_on_main_path_analysis,
	abstract = {The last few years have seen a growing interest in main path analysis among scholars across a wide spectrum of disciplines. Hummon and Doreian first introduced this method, and it has since become an effective technique for mapping technological trajectories, exploring scientific knowledge flows, and conducting literature reviews. Nevertheless, there are issues not broadly discussed in applying the method, including the handling of citation data, choosing a proper traversal weight scheme, search options, and interpretation of the resulting paths. This note aims to deepen the discussions and concludes with several suggestions and strategies in applying main path analysis.},

@article{blair_2020_aggregated_topic_models_for_increasing_social_media_topic_coherence,
	abstract = {This research presents a novel aggregating method for constructing an aggregated topic model that is composed of the topics with greater coherence than individual models. When generating a topic model, a number of parameters have to be specified. The resulting topics can be very general or very specific, which depend on the chosen parameters. In this study we investigate the process of aggregating multiple topic models generated using different parameters with a focus on whether combining the general and specific topics is able to increase topic coherence. We employ cosine similarity and Jensen-Shannon divergence to compute the similarity among topics and combine them into an aggregated model when their similarity scores exceed a predefined threshold. The model is evaluated against the standard topics models generated by the latent Dirichlet allocation and Non-negative Matrix Factorisation. Specifically we use the coherence of topics to compare the individual models that create aggregated models against those of the aggregated model and models generated by Non-negative Matrix Factorisation, respectively. The results demonstrate that the aggregated model outperforms those topic models at a statistically significant level in terms of topic coherence over an external corpus. We also make use of the aggregated topic model on social media data to validate the method in a realistic scenario and find that again it outperforms individual topic models.},

@article{evans_2020_the_longest_path_in_the_price_model,
	abstract = {The Price model, the directed version of the Barab{\'a}si--Albert model, produces a growing directed acyclic graph. We look at variants of the model in which directed edges are added to the new vertex in one of two ways: using cumulative advantage (preferential attachment) choosing vertices in proportion to their degree, or with random attachment in which vertices are chosen uniformly at random. In such networks, the longest path is well defined and in some cases is known to be a better approximation to geodesics than the shortest path. We define a reverse greedy path and show both analytically and numerically that this scales with the logarithm of the size of the network with a coefficient given by the number of edges added using random attachment. This is a lower bound on the length of the longest path to any given vertex and we show numerically that the longest path also scales with the logarithm of the size of the network but with a larger coefficient that has some weak dependence on the parameters of the model.},

@article{yu_2020_knowledge_diffusion_paths_of_blockchain_domain_the_main_path_analysis,
	abstract = {Blockchain technology, as a disruptive technology, has received widespread attention in the past few years from all over the world, leading to rapid growth in research outputs. This paper adopts a quantitative method, the main path analysis, to comprehensively and systematically investigate the development trajectories of blockchain. Four different main paths, the global main path, the forward local main path, the backward local main path and the key-route main path are conducted simultaneously. By analyzing these various paths, on the one hand, this paper finds that papers on paths focus on two aspects, cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based applications. On the other hand, this paper discovers several major research areas of blockchain, including internet of things (IoT), healthcare, energy industry, voting, insurance and supply chain management. At the same time, this paper further analyzes the research hotspots, as well as the development trajectories of blockchain in the areas of IoT, healthcare and supply chain management by using the key-route main path analysis. This paper is conductive for both the new and experienced researchers to identify some influential papers and grasp the knowledge diffusion paths in these domains.},
