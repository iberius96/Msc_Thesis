@article{ozyurt_2021_a_new_topic_modeling_based_approach_for_aspect_extraction_in_aspect_based_sentiment_analysis_ss_lda,
	abstract = {With the widespread use of social networks, blogs, forums and e-commerce web sites, the volume of user generated textual data is growing exponentially. User opinions in product reviews or in other textual data are crucial for manufacturers, retailers and providers of the products and services. Therefore, sentiment analysis and opinion mining have become important research areas. In user reviews mining, topic modeling based approaches and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are significant methods that are used in extracting product aspects in aspect based sentiment analysis. However, LDA cannot be directly applied on user reviews and on other short texts because of data sparsity problem and lack of co-occurrence patterns. Several studies have been published for the adaptation of LDA for short texts. In this study, a novel method for aspect based sentiment analysis, Sentence Segment LDA (SS-LDA) is proposed. SS-LDA is a novel adaptation of LDA algorithm for product aspect extraction. The experimental results reveal that SS-LDA is quite competitive in extracting products aspects.},

@article{girgin_2021_ranking_influencers_of_social_networks_by_semantic_kernels_and_sentiment_information,
	abstract = {Inspired by the importance of social media, a Social Network Opinion Leaders (SNOL) system has been proposed in this paper. The purpose of this system is to identify topic-based opinion leaders of social media. In order to accomplish this goal, several steps have been taken, such as data collection, data processing, data analysis, data classification, ranking of topic-based opinion leaders, and evaluation. The SNOL system has two main parts. In the first part, collected tweets are classified by semantic kernels for topic-based analysis. In the second part, leadership scores are given to each user in the network according to topic modeling and user modeling results. Leadership scores are then calculated with the formula generated and opinion leaders are determined for each category. Experiments are performed on data gathered from Twitter including 17,234,924 tweets from 38,727 users. The evaluation of opinion leader detection is a difficult job since there is no standard method for identifying opinion leaders. Therefore, the evaluation of the results of this study has been done using two different methods, retweet count and spread score, to prove that the suggested methodology outperforms the PageRank algorithm. The results have also been evaluated considering the user-topic sentiment correlation of the retrieved lists. Furthermore, SNOL has been compared against some opinion leader detection methods previously presented in the literature. The experimental results show that SNOL generates remarkably higher performance than the PageRank algorithm and other existing algorithms in the literature for nearly all topics and all selected top N opinion leaders.},

@article{altinel_2018_semantic_text_classification_a_survey_of_past_and_recent_advances,
	abstract = {Automatic text classification is the task of organizing documents into pre-determined classes, generally using machine learning algorithms. Generally speaking, it is one of the most important methods to organize and make use of the gigantic amounts of information that exist in unstructured textual format. Text classification is a widely studied research area of language processing and text mining. In traditional text classification, a document is represented as a bag of words where the words in other words terms are cut from their finer context i.e. their location in a sentence or in a document. Only the broader context of document is used with some type of term frequency information in the vector space. Consequently, semantics of words that can be inferred from the finer context of its location in a sentence and its relations with neighboring words are usually ignored. However, meaning of words, semantic connections between words, documents and even classes are obviously important since methods that capture semantics generally reach better classification performances. Several surveys have been published to analyze diverse approaches for the traditional text classification methods. Most of these surveys cover application of different semantic term relatedness methods in text classification up to a certain degree. However, they do not specifically target semantic text classification algorithms and their advantages over the traditional text classification. In order to fill this gap, we undertake a comprehensive discussion of semantic text classification vs. traditional text classification. This survey explores the past and recent advancements in semantic text classification and attempts to organize existing approaches under five fundamental categories; domain knowledge-based approaches, corpus-based approaches, deep learning based approaches, word/character sequence enhanced approaches and linguistic enriched approaches. Furthermore, this survey highlights the advantages of semantic text classification algorithms over the traditional text classification algorithms.},

@article{altinel_2017_instance_labeling_in_semi_supervised_learning_with_meaning_values_of_words,
	abstract = {In supervised learning systems; only labeled samples are used for building a classifier that is then used to predict the class labels of the unlabeled samples. However, obtaining labeled data is very expensive, time consuming and difficult in real-life practical situations as labeling a data set requires the effort of a human expert. On the other side, unlabeled data are often plentiful which makes it relatively inexpensive and easier to obtain. Semi-Supervised Learning methods strive to utilize this plentiful source of unlabeled examples to increase the learning capacity of the classifier particularly when amount of labeled examples are restricted. Since SSL techniques usually reach higher accuracy and require less human effort, they attract a substantial amount of attention both in practical applications and theoretical research. A novel semi-supervised methodology is offered in this study. This algorithm utilizes a new method to predict the class labels of unlabeled examples in a corpus and incorporate them into the training set to build a better classifier. The approach presented here depends on a meaning calculation, which computes the words' meaning scores in the scope of classes. Meaning computation is constructed on the Helmholtz principle and utilized to various applications in the field of text mining like feature extraction, information retrieval and document summarization. Nevertheless, according to the literature, ILBOM is the first work which uses meaning calculation in a semi-supervised way to construct a semantic smoothing kernel for Support Vector Machines (SVM). Evaluation of the proposed methodology is done by performing various experiments on standard textual datasets. ILBOM's experimental results are compared with three baseline algorithms including SVM using linear kernel which is one of the most frequently used algorithms in text classification field. Experimental results show that labeling unlabeled instances based on meaning scores of words to augment the training set is valuable, and increases the classification accuracy on previously unseen test instances significantly.},
