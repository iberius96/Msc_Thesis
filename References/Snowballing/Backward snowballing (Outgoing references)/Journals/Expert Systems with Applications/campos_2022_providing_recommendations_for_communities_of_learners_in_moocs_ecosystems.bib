@article{zhang_2021_the_learning_behaviours_of_dropouts_in_moocs_a_collective_attention_network_perspective,
	abstract = {Understanding the dropout phenomenon has advanced from viewing it as a sign of deficient quality to viewing it as an explicit sign of individual choice, which highlights the importance of investigating how dropouts learn in massive open online courses (MOOCs). Nevertheless, the short, limited and heterogeneous behaviours of individual dropouts create challenges for understanding how dropouts learn over time. Taking a systematic network perspective, this study used clickstream data to build a flow network model of collective attention to investigate how dropouts learn in XuetangX's Introduction to Psychology (2018 autumn). The results showed that the quantification of behavioural data presented a stereotypical image of dropouts, but the network analytics presented a rather different picture of how dropouts learn. Recognising the distinct roles of introductory learning resources could prevent dropping out and improve the accuracy of prediction models. Interestingly, the assessments embedded in the MOOCs performed a scaffolding role in guiding dropouts to learn. Thus, redesigning quizzes or examinations in open and flexible learning environments to construct a minimum cost network of collective attention is vital to making this online space cost effective for learners at risk.},

@article{symeonidis_2019_multi_modal_matrix_factorization_with_side_information_for_recommending_massive_open_online_courses,
	abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have recently gained a huge users' attention on the Web. They are considered as a highly promising form of teaching from leading universities such as Stanford and Berkeley. However, users confront the problem of choosing among thousands of offered MOOCs. In such a scenario of severe ``information overload'', recommender systems can be very useful to recommend the right course to a user, since they base their operation on past user's log history. For example, Coursera recommends courses to users so that, they can acquire those skills, that are expected from their ideal job. These user's preferences are not expected to be independent from others choices, as users follow trends of similar behaviour. In this paper, we propose, xSVD++, where the ``x'' means that it is a multi-dimensional Matrix Factorization (MMF) model combined with Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithm, which exploits information from external resources (i.e., users' skills, courses' characteristics, etc.) to predict course trends and to perform rating predictions according to them. Our experimental results indicate that xSVD++ is superior over classic and non-negative matrix factorization algorithms and the state-of-the-art CMF, and SVD++ algorithms.},

@article{shu_2018_a_content_based_recommendation_algorithm_for_learning_resources,
	abstract = {Automatic multimedia learning resources recommendation has become an increasingly relevant problem: it allows students to discover new learning resources that match their tastes, and enables the e-learning system to target the learning resources to the right students. In this paper, we propose a content-based recommendation algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN can be used to predict the latent factors from the text information of the multimedia resources. To train the CNN, its input and output should first be solved. For its input, the language model is used. For its output, we propose the latent factor model, which is regularized by L1-norm. Furthermore, the split Bregman iteration method is introduced to solve the model. The major novelty of the proposed recommendation algorithm is that the text information is used directly to make the content-based recommendation without tagging. Experimental results on public databases in terms of quantitative assessment show significant improvements over conventional methods. In addition, the split Bregman iteration method which is introduced to solve the model can greatly improve the training efficiency.},

@article{li_2021_carm_confidence_aware_recommender_model_via_review_representation_learning_and_historical_rating_behavior_in_the_online_platforms,
	abstract = {The recommendation systems in the online platforms often suffer from the rating data sparseness and information overload issues. Previous studies on this topic often leverage review information to construct an accurate user/item latent factor. To address this issue, we propose a novel confidence-aware recommender model via review representation learning and historical rating behavior in this article. It is motived that ratings are consistent with reviews in terms of user preferences, and reviews often contain misleading comments (e.g., fake good reviews, fake bad reviews). To this end, the interaction latent factor of user and item in the framework is constructed by exploiting review information interactivity. Then, the confidence matrix, which measures the relationship between the rating outliers and misleading reviews, is employed to further improve the model accuracy and reduce the impact of misleading reviews on the model. Furthermore, the loss function is constructed by maximum a posteriori estimation theory. Finally, the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm is introduced to optimize the loss function. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets empirically demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method also further promotes the application in learning resource adaptation. The source Python code will be available upon request.},

	abstract = {The growing popularity of massively accessed Web applications that store and analyze large amounts of data, being Facebook, Twitter and Google Search some prominent examples of such applications, have posed new requirements that greatly challenge traditional RDBMS. In response to this reality, a new way of creating and manipulating data stores, known as NoSQL databases, has arisen. This paper reviews implementations of NoSQL databases in order to provide an understanding of current tools and their uses. First, NoSQL databases are compared with traditional RDBMS and important concepts are explained. Only databases allowing to persist data and distribute them along different computing nodes are within the scope of this review. Moreover, NoSQL databases are divided into different types: Key-Value, Wide-Column, Document-oriented and Graph-oriented. In each case, a comparison of available databases is carried out based on their most important features.},

@proceedings{bhatt_2018_seqsense_video_recommendation_using_topic_sequence_mining,
	abstract = {This paper examines content-based recommendation in domains exhibiting sequential topical structure. An example is educational video, including Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in which knowledge builds within and across courses. Conventional content-based or collaborative filtering recommendation methods do not exploit courses'sequential nature. We describe a system for video recommendation that combines topic-based video representation with sequential pattern mining of inter-topic relationships. Unsupervised topic modeling provides a scalable and domain-independent representation. We mine inter-topic relationships from manually constructed syllabi that instructors provide to guide students through their courses. This approach also allows the inclusion of multi-video sequences among the recommendation results. Integrating the resulting sequential information with content-level similarity provides relevant as well as diversified recommendations. Quantitative evaluation indicates that the proposed system, SeqSense, recommends fewer redundant videos than baseline methods, and instead emphasizes results consistent with mined topic transitions.},

However, the relatively low completion rates of MOOC participants has been a central criticism in the popular discourse. Some studies point to up to 90{\%} evasion in some courses. The lack of knowledge in relation to course prerequisites (background gaps) is one of the reasons that reduce the completion rate. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes the use of a Linked Courses structure to provide support to students. In this proposal, before starting a course, the background gaps of each student are identified and a personalized set of support courses is recommended to help him. Results obtained so far indicate the effectiveness of this approach.},

@inproceedings{campos_2020_a_recommendation_system_based_on_knowledge_gap_identification_in_moocs_ecosystems,
	abstract = {The consolidation of recommendation systems in a big data era brings opportunities in different scenarios to customize methods that recommend data. In the scenarios of the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) ecosystems, these recommenders mainly support students in choosing the best courses from the platforms. However, the expansion of course platforms and the scarcity of student data increases the difficulty in finding courses, or even part of courses, that fill a given knowledge gap. In this paper, we propose a recommendation system to support students in finding the best modules or courses in these ecosystems. First, topic modeling techniques were implemented with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to find similarities between multiple MOOCs providers. Then, a content-based recommendation provides recommendations to a user interested in acquiring new knowledge, based on a history extraction on those platforms. We evaluate our approach through an experiment with real data collected in multiple MOOCs providers. In addition, by comparing the NMF approach with a baseline Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique, we verify the model effectiveness and show that our system is useful to this context.},

@inproceedings{jing_2017_guess_you_like_course_recommendation_in_moocs,
	abstract = {Recommending courses to online students is a fundamental and also challenging issue in MOOCs. Not exactly like recommendation in traditional online systems, students who enrolled the same course may have very different purposes and with very different backgrounds. For example, one may want to study "data mining" after studying the course of "big data analytics" because the former is a prerequisite course of the latter, while some other may choose "data mining" simply because of curiosity.Employing the complete data from XuetangX1, one of the largest MOOCs in China, we conduct a systematic investigation on the problem of student behavior modeling for course recommendation. We design a content-aware algorithm framework using content based users' access behaviors to extract user-specific latent information to represent students' interest profile. We also leverage the demographics and course prerequisite relation to better reveal users' potential choice. Finally, we develop a course recommendation algorithm based on the user interest, demographic profiles and course prerequisite relation using collaborative filtering strategy. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs much better than several baselines (over 2X by MRR). We have deployed the recommendation algorithm onto the platform XuetangX as a new feature, which significantly helps improve the course recommendation performance (+24.6\% by click rate) comparing with the recommendation strategy previously used in the system.},
