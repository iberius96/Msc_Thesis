@inproceedings{burel_2017_on_semantics_and_deep_learning_for_event_detection_in_crisis_situations,
	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce Dual-CNN, a semantically-enhanced deep learning model to target the problem of event detection in crisis situations from social media data. A layer of semantics is added to a traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to capture the contextual information that is generally scarce in short, ill-formed social media messages. Our results show that our methods are able to successfully identify the existence of events, and event types (hurricane, floods, etc.) accurately ({\ensuremath{>}} 79\% F-measure), but the performance of the model significantly drops (61\% F-measure) when identifying fine-grained event-related information (affected individuals, damaged infrastructures, etc.). These results are competitive with more traditional Machine Learning models, such as SVM.},

SemEval-2017 Task 4 continues with a rerun of the subtasks of SemEval-2016 Task 4, which include identifying the overall sentiment of the tweet, sentiment towards a topic with classification on a two-point and on a five-point ordinal scale, and quantification of the distribution of sentiment towards a topic across a number of tweets: again on a two-point and on a five-point ordinal scale. Compared to 2016, we made two changes: (i) we introduced a new language, Arabic, for all subtasks, and (ii) we made available information from the profiles of the Twitter users who posted the target tweets. The task continues to be very popular, with a total of 48 teams participating this year.},

	abstract = {Understanding emotions is one of the most important aspects of personal development and growth and, as such, it is a key tile for the emulation of human intelligence. Besides being a important for the advancement of AI, emotion processing is also important for the closely related task of polarity detection. The opportunity automatically to capture the sentiments of the general public about social events, political movements, marketing campaigns, and product preferences, in fact, has raised increasing interest both in the scientific community, for the exciting open challenges, and in the business world, for the remarkable fallouts in marketing and financial market prediction. This has led to the emerging fields of affective computing and sentiment analysis, which leverage on human-computer interaction, information retrieval, and multimodal signal processing for distilling people's sentiments from the ever-growing amount of online social data.},

@inproceedings{cavallari_2017_learning_community_embedding_with_community_detection_and_node_embedding_on_graphs,
	abstract = {In this paper, we study an important yet largely under-explored setting of graph embedding, i.e., embedding communities instead of each individual nodes. We find that community embedding is not only useful for community-level applications such as graph visualization, but also beneficial to both community detection and node classification. To learn such embedding, our insight hinges upon a closed loop among community embedding, community detection and node embedding. On the one hand, node embedding can help improve community detection, which outputs good communities for fitting better community embedding. On the other hand, community embedding can be used to optimize the node embedding by introducing a community-aware high-order proximity. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel community embedding framework that jointly solves the three tasks together. We evaluate such a framework on multiple real-world datasets, and show that it improves graph visualization and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various application tasks, e.g., community detection and node classification.},

@article{rawashdeh_2017_mining_tag_clouds_to_improve_social_media_recommendation,
	abstract = {Massive amounts of data are available on social websites, therefore finding the suitable item is a challenging issue. According to recent social statistics, we have more than 930 million people are using WhatsApp with more than 340 million active daily users and 955 million people who access Facebook daily with an average daily photo uploads up to 325 million. The approach presented in this paper employs the collaborative tagging accumulated by huge number of users to improve social media recommendation. Our approach has two phases, in the first phase, we compute the tag-item weight model and in the second phase, we compute the user-tag preference model. After that we employ the two models to find the suitable items tailored to the user's preferences and recommend the items with the highest score. Also our model can compute the tag score and suggest the tags with the highest weight to the user according to their preferences. The experiment results performed on Flicker and MovieLens prove that our approach is capable to improve the social media recommendation.},
