@article{yang_2019_in_airbnb_we_trust_understanding_consumers_trust_attachment_building_mechanisms_in_the_sharing_economy,
	abstract = {The sharing norm has enabled many of unused resources revamped and returned with some value to both travelers and local communities in the sharing economy. Airbnb requires remarkable trust that goes beyond the level where both user and host take risks from a sharing transaction. This paper suggests an empirical research model developed based on the trust building model and attachment theory explaining how users develop their trust and further attachment through two major routes. The results indicate that the cognitive trust-identity attachment building mechanism is more effective than affective trust-bond attachment depending on the emotional distance between the users and hosts. Finally, this paper provides scholars with theoretical enhancement on the trust and attachment literature and recommends managers of the sharing businesses to enrich users' trust-attachment toward the firm and the service provider that has a strong influence on users' behavioral intention to use.},

@article{xu_2017_the_influence_of_e_services_on_customer_online_purchasing_behavior_toward_remanufactured_products,
	abstract = {Remarketing and reselling remanufactured electronic products is one of the effective and sustainable approaches to deal with the rapidly increasing e-waste. Studying customer purchasing intention and behavior toward remanufactured products can help businesses better understand customers' needs and improve closed-loop supply chain performance. Via an empirical study based on new, manufacturer remanufactured, seller remanufactured, and used products transaction data from eBay, one of the most popular online markets, this paper investigates the impact of e-service offerings in four online transaction phases (i.e., information, agreement, fulfillment, and after-sales phase) on customer purchasing intention toward remanufactured products in both auctions and fixed price transactions. The results indicate that e-service offerings in the information phase are most influential on customers' willingness to pay (WTP) in both types of transactions. In addition, we find e-services in auctions has higher positive influence on customers' WTP compared to fixed price transactions, as demonstrated by the results that e-services in all four online transaction phases significantly influence customers' WTP in auctions, but not in fixed price transactions. The results also show that in both types of transactions, customers are willing to pay a premium for seller remanufactured products, and even more for manufacturer remanufactured products and new products, compared with used products. Furthermore, we discuss the managerial implications on customer online purchasing intention toward remanufactured products and online sellers' sales strategies.},

@article{xu_2018_does_traveler_satisfaction_differ_in_various_travel_group_compositions,
	abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate the online customer review behavior and determinants of overall satisfaction with hotels of travelers in various travel group compositions. Design/methodology/approach The author collected data from online reviews of travelers in various travel group compositions from 600 hotels in 100 of the largest cities in the USA from Booking.com and used latent semantic analysis (LSA) to identify the positive and negative factors from online reviews of travelers in various travel group compositions. Then, text regression was used to determine the influential factors of overall satisfaction of travelers in various travel group compositions. Findings It was found in this study that not all the positive and negative textual factors mined from travelers'online reviews significantly influenced their overall satisfaction. In addition, the determinants of traveler satisfaction were different when travelers were in different travel group compositions. Research limitations/implications The author found similar online review behavior, but different basic, excitement and performance factors of travelers in different travel group compositions. Practical implications This study helps hoteliers understand customers'perception of the specific attributes of their products and services, which provides a guideline for businesses to design the priority rule to improve these corresponding attributes and use market segmentation strategy when dealing with customers in different travel group compositions. Originality/value The author examined and compared the online review behavior and determinants of satisfaction using the factors mined from online reviews between travelers in various travel group compositions. This study combined customer ratings with textual reviews and predicted customer ratings from the factors extracted from textual reviews using LSA and text regression.},

	abstract = {Do customer online reviews truly reflect the determinants of customer overall satisfaction with hotels? Using a text mining approach: latent semantic analysis and a text regression approach, this study compared the product and service attributes contributing to customer perception on editor-recommended and -nonrecommended hotels at various star levels. This study found that positive and negative attributes contributing to customer perception differ; even for the same attribute, its importance level for customer perception differs between different types of hotels. This study found an asymmetric effect of the focus of online reviews and determinants of customer satisfaction: not all positive/negative textual factors mined from online customer reviews significantly influence their overall satisfaction, and the emphasis level of a certain attribute in customer reviews differs from the relative importance level of the influence of the attribute on customer overall satisfaction. This shows the different psychological mechanisms of customers writing online reviews and their overall satisfaction generation.},

@article{sutherland_2018_the_sharing_economy_and_digital_platforms_a_review_and_research_agenda,
	abstract = {Over the last few years the sharing economy has been changing the way that people share and conduct transactions in digital spaces. This research phenomenon has drawn scholars from a large number of disparate fields and disciplines into an emerging research area. Given the variety of perspectives represented, there is a great need to collect and connect what has been done, and to identify some common themes, which will serve as a basis for future discussions on the crucial roles played by digital platforms in the sharing economy. Drawing on a collection of 435 publications on the sharing economy and related terms, we identify some trends in the literature and underlying research interests. Specifically, we organize the literature around the concept of platform mediation, and draw a set of essential affordances of sharing economy technologies from the reviewed literature. We present the notion of platform centralization/decentralization as an effective organizing principle for the variety of perspectives on the sharing economy, and also evaluate scholars' treatment of technology itself. Finally, we identify important gaps in the existing literature on the relationship between digital platforms and sharing economy, and provide directions for future investigations.},

@article{so_2018_motivations_and_constraints_of_airbnb_consumers_findings_from_a_mixed_methods_approach,
	abstract = {Airbnb is widely recognized as a disruptive innovation in the tourism industry. While separate studies have examined various factors affecting consumers' adoption of Airbnb, the literature has largely focused on a handful of factors in isolation. Adopting a sequential mixed-methods approach, this study proposes a comprehensive conceptual model integrating the literature and findings of a qualitative study and subsequently tests the model via a national survey. The results suggest that, for motivations, price value, enjoyment, and home benefits significantly explain overall attitude toward Airbnb. As for constraints, distrust is the only factor that significantly predicts overall attitude, while insecurity is directly related to behavioral intentions. Overall attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms, such as social influence and trend affinity, predict behavioral intentions. This study contributes to the literature by simultaneously examining the predictive power of both motivations and constraints of Airbnb consumers in explaining overall attitude and purchase behavior.},

@article{siering_2018_disentangling_consumer_recommendations_explaining_and_predicting_airline_recommendations_based_on_online_reviews,
	abstract = {Consumer recommendations of products and services are important performance indicators for organizations to gain feedback on their offerings. Furthermore, they are important for prospective customers to learn from prior consumer experiences. In this study, we focus on user-generated content, in particular online reviews, to investigate which service aspects are evaluated by consumers and how these factors explain a consumer's recommendation. Further, we investigate how recommendations can be predicted automatically based on such user-driven responses. We disentangle the recommendation decision by performing explanatory and predictive analyses focusing on a sample of airline reviews. We identify core and augmented service aspects expressed in the online review. We then show that service aspect-specific sentiment indicators drive the decision to recommend an airline and that these factors can be incorporated in a predictive model using data mining techniques. We also find that the business model of an airline being reviewed, whether low cost or full service, is also an applicable consideration. Our results are highly relevant for practitioners to analyze and act on consumer feedback in a prompt manner, along with the ability of gaining a deeper understanding of the service from multiple aspects. Also, potential travelers can benefit from this approach by getting an aggregated view on service quality.},

@article{roma_2019_sharing_economy_and_incumbents_pricing_strategy_the_impact_of_airbnb_on_the_hospitality_industry,
	abstract = {In this paper, we examine how the emergence of sharing economy platforms influences incumbents' price responses. Grounding on the literature on price reactions to new entrants and on the unique characteristics of the sharing economy, we argue that the effect of the penetration of the sharing economy on incumbents' prices is not straightforward, and actually depends on the type of incumbents as well as certain product/service offer characteristics. Indeed, relying on a large sample of hotel price offerings from the Italian market, we find that the effect of the growing relevance of the sharing economy (exemplified by Airbnb) on incumbents' prices depends on the type of incumbents (low/medium-end versus high-end hotels) as well as on the accommodation period (weekend versus weekdays), and thus on the type of consumers looking for accommodation. Specifically, low/medium-end incumbents set lower prices in geographical areas where sharing economy has a higher penetration, but this occurs only for weekend accommodation search. In contrast, high-end incumbents tend to set higher prices in geographical areas where sharing economy has a higher penetration, irrespective of the accommodation period. We discuss the important implications of our findings for incumbents, sharing economy platforms, consumers, and policy makers.},

	abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to investigate customers'perceptions of the service quality facets of Airbnb accommodation using social exchange theory as a suitable conceptual framework to explain aspects of interactivity between guests and hosts. Design/methodology/approach A self-administered questionnaire consisting of 25 accommodation-specific service quality attributes, structured according to Akbaba's (2006) measurement scale and based on the service quality hierarchical conceptualization described by Brady and Cronin (2001) and Cronin and Taylor (1992), was distributed to Airbnb international guests visiting Phuket, Thailand. The sample was chosen through a two-stage sampling process and the PLS-SEM technique was used for data analysis. Findings The results showed that convenience and assurance are critical contributors to the measurement of service quality in remote Airbnb lodgings. The findings further revealed that Airbnb guests are mainly interested in lodgings which have access to certain tourist sights, and in easily accessible information and efficient resolution of problems during their stay. The authors also found that guests greatly value the convenience and flexibility offered by Airbnb, and that they particularly appreciate the warm hospitality provided by the hosts. Finally, Airbnb guests have very low expectations of the amenities and services available at the lodgings. Research limitations/implications Airbnb is one of the most well-known examples of hospitality in the sharing economy, and results cannot be generalized to similar accommodation providers in sharing economies. Despite the appropriateness of using the measurement tool provided by Akbaba (2006), it is only one option among others for measuring service quality. Practical implications The current study can assist hosts in gaining better knowledge of guests'decision-making processes and in designing effective marketing strategies by focusing on guests'requirements in terms of service quality. The effective use of competitive strengths and the prioritization of business resources would potentially enhance guests'positive experiences at the accommodation and at the destination. Originality/value Limited numbers of studies have focused on the sharing economy and hospitality and in particular on Airbnb, and this is the first study with a focus on service quality issues in terms of Airbnb accommodation.},

The findings reveal three sufficient configurations that are able to influence the overall experience: (i) the price-quality nexus, (ii) risk perspective, and (iii) social interaction. The research also compares nonlinear analysis with the dominant parametric methods in tourism and hospitality research (regression; Cramer's V), highlighting the suitability of the former for complexity examination.

Given the divide that exists, this paper proposes a phenomenographic approach to the study of destination competitiveness. Specifically, the paper argues that efforts to advance destination competitiveness should be preceded by a better understanding of how destination stakeholders is conceptualize the term. This paper explores how destination stakeholders understand destination competitiveness. The findings reveal three distinct conceptions of destination competitiveness which are hierarchically related: destination competitiveness as perception of a destination, destination competitiveness as performance, and destination competitiveness as a long-term process. Additional features of destination competitiveness are discussed including the relationship between competitiveness and attractiveness, and the dynamic nature of the competitor set. This paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for advancing the destination competitiveness concept.},

However, there is still limited consensus on fundamental characteristics of sharing models, the markets they create, and the controversies surrounding them. Based on an assessment of existing typologies of the sharing economy, this paper outlines a new theory-driven framework for describing and analyzing business-to-consumer and peer-to-peer sharing models that draws on the nascent literature of partial organization. Emphasizing the core organizational characteristics of sharing models (membership, rules, monitoring, sanctioning, and hierarchy), this new framework moves beyond existing definitions and scales used to map and analyze the fast-growing sharing economy field.},

@article{moon_2019_peer_to_peer_interactions_perspectives_of_airbnb_guests_and_hosts,
	abstract = {In peer-to-peer (P2P) accommodation settings such as Airbnb, social interactions between peers are distinctively different from those between guests and employees in conventional lodging establishments. This study focuses on a reciprocal aspect of social interactions in P2P accommodations and aims to: 1) explore how guests and hosts perceive online and face-to-face interactions between them and 2) investigate the association between P2P interactions and some outcome variables (encounter satisfaction, word-of-mouth intention, and continuous intention to use) based on the roles of guest and host. A total of 503 responses from an online research panel were analyzed. The results show that guests perceive overall interaction experiences more positively than do hosts. Moreover, guests and hosts place weight on different interaction factors that contribute to their satisfaction and behavioral intentions. This study sheds light on the reciprocal interactions between guests and hosts, providing important theoretical and practical implications for the P2P lodging experience.},

Design/methodology/approach This study proposes and tests an integrative model that synthesizes the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Prospect Theory (PT) and other Airbnb-relevant constructs (unique experience expectation, familiarity and electronic word of mouth) as the primary determinants of the Airbnb repurchase intention using an structural equation model (SEM) approach. Findings Both attitude and subject norms are significant determinants of repurchase intention, whereas perceived behavioral control is not. In addition, perceived value and risk have only direct significant impacts on attitude and, in turn, indirectly affect repurchase intention. Unique experience expectation, familiarity and electronic word of mouth exert direct and indirect influences on repurchase intention. Research limitations/implications This study extends the body of knowledge by integrating TPB and PT to investigate consumer repurchase intention in Airbnb, which provides a theoretical baseline and serves as a starting point for exploring the structural relationships of Airbnb and the sharing economy. Practical implications Airbnb should place more emphasis on value packages and authentic/unique travel experience to retain and attract more travelers. More safety/security programs should be put in place and clearly communicated to reduce the perceived risks. In addition, Airbnb may publicize positive word of mouth and introduce and expand familiarity programs to incentivize Airbnb travelers. Originality/value This study explores the psychological reasons why travelers will re-patronize Airbnb, providing insights into the motives of Airbnb travelers. A clear understanding of Airbnb travelers'repurchase intention will facilitate to develop effective strategies for Airbnb to induce positive repurchase behaviors.},

	abstract = {The sharing economy is a global phenomenon with rapid growth potential. While research has begun to explore segmentation between users and non-users, only limited research has looked at consumer segmentation within sharing economy services. In this paper, we build on this research gap by investigating consumer segmentation within a single sharing economy platform: Airbnb. Utilizing a mixed methods approach, with both a quantitative survey and a qualitative content analysis of Airbnb listings, we compare two different types of accommodation offered on Airbnb: shared room and entire home. Our findings indicate that within a single platform, the variety between offerings can create distinct consumer segments based on both demographics and behavioral criteria. We also find that Airbnb hosts use marketing logic to target their listings towards specific consumer segments. However, there is not, in all cases, strong alignment between consumer segmentation and host targeting, leading to potentially reduced matching efficiency.},

To that end, marketers need to develop personalized messages to enhance click-through rates and online purchases. This study explores online advertising strategies for an emerging lodging concept---Airbnb. Airbnb distinguishes itself from traditional hotels by offering guests a ``feeling at home'' (e.g., belongingness) and an ``atypical place to stay'' (e.g., uniqueness). In this research, we examine the interaction effect of advertising appeal (belongingness vs. uniqueness) and an individual's sense of power (low vs. high) on click-through intention and purchase intention. The findings suggest that powerless individuals respond more favorably to the belongingness appeal, whereas powerful individuals react more positively to the uniqueness appeal. Furthermore, results from a mediation analysis reveal that self-brand connection is the underlying mechanism that explains these effects. Managerial implications for hospitality marketers are discussed.},

However, few studies targeting the vacation-rental industry have investigated online reviews. To narrow this gap, this study focuses mainly on the gamification design developed by Airbnb that awards a ``Superhost'' badge to hosts who receive good reviews and observes how this can impact an accommodation's review volume and ratings. All available information regarding Airbnb accommodation offered in Hong Kong was retrieved from Airbnb's website. We then constructed a negative binomial model and a Tobit model with different independent variables and controlled a set of variables relating to accommodation characteristics. The results show that an accommodation with the ``Superhost'' badge is more likely to receive reviews and higher ratings. In addition, guests are willing to spend more on ``Superhost'' accommodations. Based on our findings, we present implications for research and host practice.},

The findings reveal that the sharing economy is in its early stages and the ecosystem is not yet in healthy shape. Therefore, three strategies were suggested to pave the way for sustainable development of the sharing economy ecosystem: alignment to mutual interests, collaboration for shared success, and commitment to social responsibility.},

Specifically, this study examined whether individual-level anthropomorphic tendency and text-personification of destination marketing communications interact to influence destination attitude and travel intentions. Results from a study involving 210 Australian participants revealed that destination attitude and travel intentions were most favorable for people with high levels of anthropomorphic tendency and who were exposed to personified tourism messages. These findings indicate that text-personification represents a new communication tactic for tourism -- particularly for target consumers who are high in anthropomorphic tendency -- and one that can humanize the destination leading to more favorable attitudes and higher intentions to travel. This effect is mediated by positive emotions. People with high anthropomorphic tendency who are exposed to a personified advertisement feel more positive emotions, which lead to positive tourism outcomes.},

We investigate how decision support information (i.e., online reviews) can lead to information overload and decision difficulty, and ultimately affect decision satisfaction. A series of three experimental studies with subjects from a professional marketing agency examine the influence of self-determined review quantity and perceived review quality on satisfaction, as well as the mediating effects of information overload and decision difficulty. Our results show that the effect of perceived review quality on information overload is enhanced when the consumer chooses to read more reviews. Individual characteristics are also relevant; consumers' product knowledge moderates the mediating effect of decision difficulty on satisfaction. This study contributes to the literature by (1) investigating how the characteristics of decision support information affect decision process and outcome, and (2) exploring the boundary conditions wherein online reviews can empower but also overload consumers under various decision contexts.},

	abstract = {This study aims to examine how performance of hotel services symmetrically and asymmetrically affects overall customer satisfaction. For this purpose, data were collected from Turkish, German and Russian hotel customers staying at a five-star golf hotel in the Belek area in Antalya-Turkey. Data were first analyzed by multi-variable regression analysis for clarifying the symmetric impacts of eight service dimensions on overall customer satisfaction. Results showed that Entertainment Services, Restaurant Services, Cleaning of General Areas and Foreign Language Knowledge of Staff had the highest influences on customer satisfaction. Penalty-reward-contrast analysis was performed for the same service dimensions to understand their asymmetric influences on customer satisfaction. Significantly different categorizations (i.e. satisfiers; dissatisfiers if absent; hybrids) were obtained for three major market segments. Entertainment Services had been the only dimension which was categorized as a `dissatisfier if absent' for all markets. Additional comparisons were made among the first-time and repeat customers, whereas Housekeeping Services were identified as the `dissatisfiers if absent' for both groups.},

	abstract = {The global rise of the sharing economy has attracted widespread attention among managers, marketers and researchers as non-ownership modes of consumption are increasingly being adopted by consumers. Building on previous research that distinguishes non-ownership consumption programs, this article investigates the role of materialism in participation in sharing-based programs of the sharing economy cross culturally. Unlike previous research that stated that materialism is in contrast with sharing, this research shows that under certain circumstances, both in America and India, materialism will lead to greater participation in the sharing economy. However, the reason why is different for each culture. For Americans, this effect is expected to surface for programs that resemble sharing as they don't compete with ownership of products but rather encourage materialist consumers to seek out transformative and hedonic experiences that are expected to improve their self-image and well-being. For Indians, materialism will lead to participation in sharing-based programs through increased perceived utility. Managerial and theoretical implications are discussed.},

@article{choi_2019_values_of_food_leftover_sharing_platforms_in_the_sharing_economy,
	abstract = {For many food products, such as fresh vegetable and fruit, proper handling of product leftovers is critical. In recent years, food leftover sharing (FLS) platforms that can provide a means to collect the unsold food products from individual retailers and create values from them have emerged. Motivated by this real world observation, we build a single supplier multi-retailer analytical supply chain model to explore the value of this kind of FLS platform. In the decentralized supply chain setting, we prove that the presence of FLS platform is beneficial to the retailers, the supplier, the consumers and the environment. Whether it benefits the supply chain economically depends on the logistics costs (incurred from the food product leftover collection by the FLS platform). We extend the analysis to the case with a centralized supply chain and show that the FLS platform is guaranteed to help improve the environment, but the consumers and the supply chain are only benefited when the logistics costs are sufficiently small. Sensitivity analyses are conducted which show that for both centralized and decentralized supply chain settings, the FLS platform is especially helpful in enhancing social welfare when the unit food product leftover cost is higher, the unit benefit derived from reusing the food product leftovers is higher, or the unit logistics cost is lower. We further consider the case when the logistics cost with the use of platform is high, propose the use of government sponsors to help and provide the conditions under which this sponsor is well-justified with respect to social welfare enhancement.},

This study empirically investigates the effect of online review contents on potential guests' trust perceptions in AirBnB.com. Six thematic characteristics of accommodation experiences were found as salient themes from online review contents, and corresponding relationships regarding trust perceptions were investigated: Through content analysis and theme extraction in python, our results show the salient cognitive themes are room aesthetics, host attributes, location, repurchase intention, overall evaluation and room description. Trust perceptions were both evaluated by individual coders and predicted by a convolutional neural network. Results suggest salient themes determine trust perception: Host attributes positively lead to benevolence, location and room aesthetics positively affect ability, room description positively affects integrity, and location and host attributes determine overall trust perception.},

Through an online multilingual survey, 23,446 responses consisting of perceptions, evoked by way of free-recall, associated to Dream and Favourite Destinations, were collected. Findings point to clear structural differences between the imagery of Dream and Favourite Destinations. Additionally, a theoretical destination imagery model that offers a basis for future studies is proposed, and some managerial implications of significant relevance to destination marketing are discussed.},

Design/methodology/approach This paper makes use of a qualitative online content analysis to extract Airbnb data and to analyse guest reviews and host responses posted in the context of Malta. Findings A theoretical framework is proposed revealing six distinct themes of guest--host social practices and their sub-categories, resulting in a spectrum of dimensions of value formation. Research limitations/implications This paper collects data from Airbnb properties in Malta, with more narratives posted by guests, implying a dominance of guest views on value co-creation and co-destruction. Findings might have a limited transferability beyond similar sharing economy platforms and tourist destinations. Practical/implications The paper uncovers guest--host hospitality value creation practices, providing concrete examples as to what practices lead to distinct value formation or destruction. In addressing the lack of knowledge about value creation practices in the sharing economy, strategic implications are offered to the hospitality sector to understand the distinct value propositions Airbnb offers compared to traditional accommodation types. Originality/value The paper's contribution is its theoretical framework of value practices of guests staying at Airbnb-listed accommodations, contributing to a better understanding of the distinct value propositions underlying collaborative consumption offers in the sharing economy.},

@article{akbar_2018_the_sharing_economy_and_the_future_of_the_hotel_industry_transaction_cost_theory_and_platform_economics,
	abstract = {The `sharing economy' is in the process of transforming numerous industries. Among these, the hotel sector is especially vulnerable to the strategic disruption that sharing platforms present. Companies such as Airbnb represent the epitome of this threat. This paper sets out to achieve two fundamental research objectives. First, it develops a set of exploratory research propositions based on a qualitative application of transaction cost theory (TCT) to the emergence of sharing platforms. Second, it offers specific strategic and tactical recommendations for the hotel industry based on the TCT analysis referred to above. The paper suggests that, in revising their business models to cope with the new competitive challenges posed by sharing platforms, hotel chains can leverage their superior capacity to deal with three key features of transactions drawn from TCT (frequency, uncertainty and asset specificity) and develop what this paper terms `integrated platforms'. By employing the TCT lens to understand the emergence of sharing platforms, this is the first study to systematically develop a theoretically grounded approach to understanding how transaction features impact the emergence of sharing platforms, and it hence has clear implications for numerous industries being impacted by these developments, not least the hotel industry.},

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of online shopping, online sellers are facing more sales opportunities and challenges in the highly-competitive e-commerce market. Sellers that can generate high customer cumulative ratings may experience higher demand and profits. We explore the question of how sellers can attain those high ratings. Using leading online shopping websites in China and the U.S., we collected data for 200 online sellers in both countries for each of 40 product categories (16,000 observations) pertaining to the sellers' respective customer cumulative ratings, history, price, and e-service offerings (customized website design, credit card payments/autopay, purchase security/seller communication, fast shipping, customer support, and refund opportunities). Via path analysis, we examine the extent to which online sellers' e-service offerings and characteristics influence customer cumulative ratings and demand. We find that the effects of online sellers' e-service offerings on customer cumulative ratings are moderated by product positioning (utilitarian/hedonic) and high/low perceived risk. Our evidence also suggests that high customer cumulative ratings positively influence demand. We discuss implications for customer online shopping behavior and online sellers' sales strategies.},
