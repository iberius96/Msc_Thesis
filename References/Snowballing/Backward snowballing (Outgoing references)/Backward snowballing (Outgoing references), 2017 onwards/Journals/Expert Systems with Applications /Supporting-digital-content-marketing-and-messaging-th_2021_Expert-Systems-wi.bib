	abstract = {In order to improve the classification accuracy, a preprocessing step is used to pre-filter some redundant or irrelevant features before decision tree construction. And a new feature selection algorithm FWDT is proposed based on this. Experimental results show that FWDT our proposed method performs better for the measures of accuracy, recall and F1-score. Furthermore, it can reduce the required time in constructing the decision tree.},

	abstract = {Nowadays online reviews play a significant role in influencing the decision of consumers. Consumers show their experience and information about product quality in their reviews. Product Reviews from Amazon to Restaurant Reviews from Yelp are facing problems with fake reviews and fake numeric ratings. Online reviews typically consist of qualitative (text format) and quantitative (rating) formats. In the case of Google Play store fake numeric ratings can play a big role in the success of apps. People tend to believe that a high-star rating may be significantly attached with a good review. However, user star level rating information does not usually match with text format of review. Despite many efforts to resolve this issue, Apple App Store and Google Play Store are still facing this problem. This study proposes a novel Google App numeric reviews & ratings contradiction prediction framework using Deep Learning approaches. The framework consists of two phases. In the first phase, the polarity of reviews are predicted using sentiment analysis tool to build ground truth. In the second phase, star ratings are predicted from text format of reviews after training deep learning models on ground truth obtained in the first phase. Experimental results demonstrate that based on actual user reviews the proposed framework significantly predicts unbiased star rating of app.},

	abstract = {Automated content analysis of online travel reviews allows identification of topics of travelers' satisfaction, yet its domain is not well researched. We suggest that the Anna Karenina principle positing a greater variability of the factors leading to business failure as opposed to those leading to success can be applied to the domain of visitors' reviews of historic and cultural attractions. The larger variability of issues in reviews of dissatisfied visitors is likely to result in limitations for automated topic modeling. We confirm our proposition using TripAdvisor reviews of the Terracotta Army museum in China, and validate the outcome with two additional sites. The study strongly suggests that application of unsupervised topic mining algorithms to negative reviews may be problematic and the results should be treated with caution. The main themes of dissatisfaction of visitors to all three sites are reported and practical implications for management of the attractions are discussed.},

	abstract = {In real datasets, most are unbalanced. Data imbalance can be defined as the number of instances in some classes greatly exceeds the number of instances in other classes. Whether in the field of data mining or machine learning, data imbalance can have adverse effects. At present, the methods to solve the problem of data imbalance can be divided into data-level methods, algorithm-level methods and hybrid methods. In this paper, we propose a weighted hybrid ensemble method for classifying imbalanced data in binary classification tasks, called WHMBoost. In the framework of the boosting algorithm, the presented method combines two data sampling methods and two base classifiers, and each sampling method and each base classifier is assigned corresponding weights, which makes them have better complementary advantages. The performance of WHMBoost has been evaluated on 40 benchmark imbalanced datasets with state of the art ensemble methods like AdaBoost, RUSBoost, SMOTEBoost using AUC, F-Measure and Geometric Mean as the performance evaluation criteria. Experimental results show significant improvement over the other methods and it can be concluded that WHMBoost is a promising and effective algorithm to deal with imbalance datasets.},

@article{YAN2020105922,
	abstract = {Decision tree algorithms have been proved to be a powerful and popular approach in classification tasks. However, they do not have reasonable classification performance in multi-class scenarios. In the present study, decision tree algorithms are combined with the one-vs-all (OVA) binarization technique to improve the generalization capabilities of the scheme. However, unlike previous literature that has focused on aggregation strategies, the present study is focused on the process of building base classifiers over the OVA scheme. A novel split criterion, entitled by the splitting point correction matrix (SPCM), is proposed in this regards, which can effectively deal with the unbalance problem caused by the OVA scheme. The SPCM is a kind of hybrid scheme, which integrates distribution and permutation information from the training data at each splitting point. Therefore, compared to other classical split criteria, such as the C4.5, the proposed method can make the right choice about the optimal splitting point at the root or internal nodes from multi-angle. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the SPCM approach, extensive experiments are carried out compared to the classical and state-of-the-art methods. The experiments are performed on sixteen datasets, where the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed method is verified. It is concluded that the SPCM method not only has excellent classification performance but also produces a more compact decision tree. Moreover, it is found that the SPCM method has especially a considerable improvement in the depth of tree.},

@article{SHAN2020113198,
	abstract = {Deep learning is an effective method for extracting the underlying information in text. However, it performs better on closed datasets and is less effective in real-world scenarios for text classification. As the data is updated and the amount of data increases, the models need to be retrained, in what is often a long training process. Therefore, we propose a novel incremental learning strategy to solve these problems. Our method, called Learn#, includes four components: a Student model, a reinforcement learning (RL) module, a Teacher model, and a discriminator model. The Student models first extract the features from the texts, then the RL module filters the results of multiple Student models. After that, the Teacher model reclassifies the filtered results to obtain the final texts category. To avoid increasing the Student models unlimitedly as the number of samples increases, the discriminator model is used to filter the Student models based on their similarity. The Learn# method has the advantage of a shorter training time than the One-Time model, because it only needs to train a new Student model each time, without changing the existing Student models. Furthermore, it can also obtain feedback during application and tune the models parameters over time. Experiments on different datasets show that our method for text classification outperforms many traditional One-Time methods, reducing training time by nearly 80%.},

	abstract = {This study investigates online complaining behavior targeting six different hotel attributes to determine whether there are distinct patterns of behavior exhibited by i) guests of different cultural backgrounds and ii) guests visiting different classes of hotels. The hotel attributes given focus include: (a) Service, (b) Cleanliness, (c) Room, (d) Sleep Quality, (e) Location, and (f) Value. In total, 353 hotels with 2,020 usable individual complaining reviews representing five different continents and 63 nationalities were collected for the analysis, which was conducted using a manual coding approach. Results indicate that online complaining behavior is influenced by cultural background. Asian and non-Asian travelers appear to place a similar emphasis on Value for money. However, Asian guests are more likely to complain about Service, while non-Asian guests are more likely to complaint about Cleanliness, Room, Sleep Quality, and Location. Additionally, online complaining behavior varies between different classes of hotel. Guests of high-class hotels are more likely to complain about Service and Value, while guests of low-class hotels are more likely to complain about Cleanliness, Room, Sleep Quality, and Location. This study contributes to the realm of hotel management by providing a better understanding of how customers from different cultural backgrounds are likely to perceive different hotel attributes.},

This work also proposes an alternative cultural distance measure by introducing optimal weight amongst Hofstede's dimensions and then compares the proposed measure with the traditional Kogut and Singh's and Kandogan's measures. By using data from the Visitor Profile Report of the Hong Kong Tourism Board and the World Trade Organisation from 2002 to 2017, along with latent growth curve modelling, multivariate regression and panel data analysis, findings confirmed the significant role of physical and cultural distance. In addition, quadratic relationships are detected using cross-validation methods. The effect of physical distance on tourist demands clearly dominates that of cultural distance in the overall market. The problem of spurious correlation and the results of three cultural distance measures are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Tree-based machine learning models such as random forests, decision trees and gradient boosted trees are popular nonlinear predictive models, yet comparatively little attention has been paid to explaining their predictions. Here we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions. (1) A polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. (2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model's performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains.},

	abstract = {More recently, deep neural networks received much attention from the recommender systems community where CNNs and RNNs were applied in different recommendation contexts and achieved state-of-the-art results on many publicly available benchmarks. While the success of the neural models came from their high expressiveness, the uninterpretability problem still one of their main drawbacks, which can have a negative side effect on the whole learning process. A good candidate to reduce the uninterpretability is using Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL), which showed a strong performance in dealing with this problem. Moreover, sparsity is another major problem of the most previous recommendation systems. In this paper, we introduce a new recommender system framework based on the generalized distillation principle that combines two modeling approaches: PSL for the knowledge-driven modeling approach and deep neural networks for the data-driven approach. Experimental results on publicly available datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art based on deep neural networks emphasizing the utility of PSL rules in handling inconsistencies, reducing the uninterpretability of the neural models and shows promising results in dealing with sparsity.},

	abstract = {People increasingly choose to express themselves online through electronic word of mouth (eWOM), generating large amounts of data, making eWOM a valuable source of information through big data analytics. This enables organizations to gain insights directly from customers' opinions for better decision making. This work presents a new methodology for evaluating an organisation's product-positioning strategy through eWOM analytics. A product's mispositioning has significant negative effects and there is strong interest in identifying ways to avoid it. Current methods that utilize eWOM for product positioning evaluation mostly use post-product release reviews and do not statistically evaluate the effect of time on the product positioning; nor do they provide any means to diagnose the cause of mispositioning. The temporal aspect of positioning, however, provides valuable insights into which product features are more time-invariant and accordingly makes it possible to plan for product redesign or repositioning to maximize profitability. A case study is presented in the context of smartphones using design science research, utilizing Twitter data regarding the release of a new product, collected using a custom Android application. The research questions addressed in this paper are: (1) How do consumers' preferences change over time with regards to the product's positioning? (2) Which product features positively influence product positioning and which negatively? To answer these questions, we compared the product-positioning strategy and consumers' opinions before and after the release of a new product to identify possible discrepancies between expected and actual positioning of the product. This work constitutes a methodological contribution with demonstrated implications for new product positioning strategy evaluation using tweet analysis.},

Despite many international mall-shopper studies, only few have compared countries using uniform constructs and descriptors. The present study sought to compare shopper segments from four countries----England, France, Ghana, and Morocco----to examine the impact of national culture (reflected through Hofstede's individualism/collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, long-/short-term orientation, and indulgence/restraint) and economic capacity (purchasing power parity) on shopper behavior. Findings suggest that culture shapes the nature of shoppers' profiles. However, purchase behavior and spending rates impacted more by culture in rich countries and more by the economic situation in poor countries. The implication is that international retailers and mall managers should consider national culture as well as economic factors in their global operations.},

	abstract = {This paper applies a smart tourism approach to tourist destination marketing campaigns through the analysis of tourists' reviews from TripAdvisor to identify significant patterns in the data. The proposed method combines topic modelling using Structured Topic Analysis with sentiment polarity, information on culture, and purchasing power of tourists for the development of a Decision Tree (DT) to predict tourists' experience. For data collection and analysis, several custom-made python scripts were used. Data underwent integration, cleansing, incomplete data processing, and imbalance data treatments prior to being analysed. The patterns that emerged from the DT are expressed in terms of rules that highlight variable combinations leading to negative or positive sentiment. The generated predictive model can be used by destination management to tailor marketing strategy by targeting tourists who are more likely to be satisfied at the destination according to their needs.},

To this end, we collected and analyzed 113,685 hotel reviews and responses and their semantic and syntactic relations. We are among the first to use visual analytics and deep learning-based natural language processing to empirically identify managerial responses. The empirical results indicate that our proposed multi-feature fusion, convolutional neural network model can make different types of data complement each other, thereby outperforming the comparisons. The visualization results can also be used to improve the performance of the proposed model and provide insights into response strategies, which further shows the theoretical and technical contributions of this study.},

@article{BARREDOARRIETA202082,
	abstract = {In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

Demographics and lodging preference do not affect eWOM behaviors. Economic incentives also have no effect on eWOM behaviors, which suggests that good reviews cannot be bought. The performance of core attributes can improve eWOM activities and eWOM praise, but the performance of facilitating attributes helps only with eWOM praise.},

This study used two national level inbound tourist samples, i.e., Tourism Research Australia's 2017 International Visitor Survey holiday/pleasure travellers' sample and the Hong Kong Tourist Satisfaction Index Project 2016 sample, to test the relationships between Hofstede's six cultural dimensions (Power Distance, Individualism/Collectivism, Masculinity/Femininity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long Term Orientation/Short Term Normative Orientation, and Indulgence/Restraint) and visitor satisfaction. Bivariate correlation with bootstrapping tests show consistent correlations between four of the six cultural dimensions and visitor satisfaction across the two samples. While Individualism and Indulgence are found to be positively related to visitor satisfaction, Power Distance and Long Term Orientation are negatively related to visitor satisfaction. The findings are validated with a further test involving the concept of cultural distance. This study contributes to the literature by providing solid evidence on the relation between culture and visitor satisfaction. Calls for future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {We propose a new multiple criteria decision aiding approach for market segmentation that integrates preference analysis and segmentation decision within a unified framework. The approach employs an additive value function as the preference model and requires consumers to provide pairwise comparisons of some products as the preference information. To analyze each consumer's preferences, the approach applies the disaggregation paradigm and the stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis to derive a set of value functions according to the preference information provided by each consumer. Then, each consumer's preferences can be represented by the distribution of possible rankings of products and associated support degrees by applying the derived value functions. On the basis of preference analysis, a new metric is proposed to measure the similarity between preferences of different consumers, and a hierarchical clustering algorithm is developed to perform market segmentation. To help firms serve consumers from different segments with targeted marketing policies and appropriate products, the approach proposes to work out a representative value function and the univocal ranking of products for each consumer so that products that rank in the front of the list can be presented to her/him. Finally, an illustrative example of a market segmentation problem details the application of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Service quality is a multi-dimensional construct which is not accurately measured by aspects deriving from numerical ratings and their associated weights. Extant literature in the expert and intelligent systems examines this issue by relying mainly on such constrained information sets. In this study, we utilize online reviews to show the information gains from the consideration of factors identified from topic modeling of unstructured data which provide a flexible extension to numerical scores to understand customer satisfaction and subsequently service quality. When numerical and textual features are combined, the explained variation in overall satisfaction improves significantly. We further present how such information can be of value for firms for corporate strategy decision-making when incorporated in an expert system that acts as a tool to perform market analysis and assess their competitive performance. We apply our methodology on airline passengers' online reviews using Structural Topic Models (STM), a recent probabilistic extension to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) that allows the incorporation of document level covariates. This innovation allows us to capture dominant drivers of satisfaction along with their dynamics and interdependencies. Results unveil the orthogonality of the low-cost aspect of airline competition when all other service quality dimensions are considered, thus explaining the success of low-cost carriers in the airline market.},

While the methodology applies to optimization problems in general, most TS applications have been and continue to be in discrete optimization. A key and distinguishing feature of tabu search is the use of special strategies based on adaptive memory. The underlying philosophy is that an effective search for optimal solutions should involve a flexible process that responds to the objective function landscape in a manner that allows it to learn appropriate directions to exploit specific areas of the solution space and useful departures to explore new terrain. The adaptive memory structures of tabu search enable the implementation of procedures that are capable of searching effectively and produce solutions of suitable quality within reasonable computational effort.},

When a metal is heated to a sufficiently high temperature, its atoms undergo disordered movements of large amplitude. If one now cools the metal down progressively, the atoms reduce their movement and tend to stabilize around fixed positions in a regular crystal structure with minimal energy. In this state, in which internal structural constraints are minimized, ductility is improved and the metal becomes easier to work. This slow cooling process is called annealing by metallurgists and it is to be contrasted with the quenching process, which consists of a rapid cooling down of the metal or alloy.},

	abstract = {Retailers have always worked to establish close relationships with customers through the retail marketing mix. Thus, the literature has a long tradition of testing the effects of various instruments on retail patronage. This meta-study synthesizes prior research into one comprehensive framework. We use 14,895 effect sizes reported by more than 239,000 shoppers from 41 countries extracted from 350 independent samples, to test the impact of 24 marketing-mix instruments on retail patronage. Specifically, we investigate the direct and indirect effects of these instruments on store satisfaction, word of mouth, patronage intention, and behavior. Product and brand management related instruments display the strongest effects on most outcome variables, whereas price, communication, service and incentive management instruments affect only selected outcomes. Distribution management turns out to be of secondary importance. However, the effectiveness of these instruments depends on the specific shopping context (food/non-food, shopping frequency, single store/agglomeration, hedonic/utilitarian), the retail environment (gross domestic product, country innovativeness, retail sales share, retail employment, Internet era), and the employed method (participant type, study design, data source). Specifically, we reveal most differences for hedonic shopping environments and developed countries. Also, the store's advertising and atmosphere have gained importance in the Internet era, while purchase incentives, in-store orientation, and store location have lost relevance. This study contributes to a synoptic understanding of the comparable effectiveness of retail marketing instruments on retail patronage. It offers insights into the effectiveness of marketing-mix instruments and provides guidance on whether and when to invest in them. It also presents an agenda for future research on marketing-mix instruments.},

	abstract = {As information is available in abundance for every topic on internet, condensing the important information in the form of summary would benefit a number of users. Hence, there is growing interest among the research community for developing new approaches to automatically summarize the text. Automatic text summarization system generates a summary, i.e. short length text that includes all the important information of the document. Since the advent of text summarization in 1950s, researchers have been trying to improve techniques for generating summaries so that machine generated summary matches with the human made summary. Summary can be generated through extractive as well as abstractive methods. Abstractive methods are highly complex as they need extensive natural language processing. Therefore, research community is focusing more on extractive summaries, trying to achieve more coherent and meaningful summaries. During a decade, several extractive approaches have been developed for automatic summary generation that implements a number of machine learning and optimization techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent text summarization extractive approaches developed in the last decade. Their needs are identified and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in a comparative manner. A few abstractive and multilingual text summarization approaches are also covered. Summary evaluation is another challenging issue in this research field. Therefore, intrinsic as well as extrinsic both the methods of summary evaluation are described in detail along with text summarization evaluation conferences and workshops. Furthermore, evaluation results of extractive summarization approaches are presented on some shared DUC datasets. Finally this paper concludes with the discussion of useful future directions that can help researchers to identify areas where further research is needed.},

	abstract = {Feature selection, as a data preprocessing strategy, has been proven to be effective and efficient in preparing data (especially high-dimensional data) for various data-mining and machine-learning problems. The objectives of feature selection include building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data-mining performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. The recent proliferation of big data has presented some substantial challenges and opportunities to feature selection. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in feature selection research. Motivated by current challenges and opportunities in the era of big data, we revisit feature selection research from a data perspective and review representative feature selection algorithms for conventional data, structured data, heterogeneous data and streaming data. Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for conventional data, we categorize them into four main groups: similarity-based, information-theoretical-based, sparse-learning-based, and statistical-based methods. To facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present an open source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (http://featureselection.asu.edu/). Also, we use it as an example to show how to evaluate feature selection algorithms. At the end of the survey, we present a discussion about some open problems and challenges that require more attention in future research.},
