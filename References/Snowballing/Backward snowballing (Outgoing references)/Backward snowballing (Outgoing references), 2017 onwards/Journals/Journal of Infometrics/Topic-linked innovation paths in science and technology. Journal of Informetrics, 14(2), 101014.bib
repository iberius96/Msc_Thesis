@article{Shank:2018aa,
	abstract = {While several JavaScript packages for visualizing phylogenetic trees exist, most are best characterized as frameworks that are designed with a specific set of tasks in mind. Extending such packages to use cases that are not available as features often ends up being difficult. Moreover, existing packages tend to produce standalone widgets that are not designed to serve as middleware, as opposed to flexible tools that can integrate with other components of an application.},

@article{Lathabai:2018aa,
	abstract = {Profuse growth of scientometrics as a research field owes a discernible attribution to the introduction of citation networks and other scientograms. Centrality analysis, path analysis and cluster analysis are three major network analysis tools. Hummon and Doreian's introduction of path retrieval methods based on (1) traversal count as weight assignment (for arcs) method and (2) search methods such as local (forward) search and global search, marked the commencement of path analysis. Original Hummon--Doreian traversal count based weight assignment methods such as Search Path Link Count and Search Path Node Pair were computationally complex. Along with the computational improvement of these weights, Batagelj added another computationally efficient traversal count method to the path analysis literature known as Search Path Count. A major development in search methods was seen recently with the introduction of innovative search methods such as backward (local) search and key-route (local and global) search by Liu and Lu. They also powered the available and new local search methods with a parameter to control the search. Major advantage of Liu--Lu methods lies in the fact that these can reveal more paths or more papers that are usually missed out in classical methods. All these contributions considered unweighted citation networks as the object of analysis. Despite being a tool of tremendous potential, path analysis is much underexplored relative to other network analysis tools. Inspired by these, we generalise Liu--Lu integrated approach, the present state-of-art in path analysis to an integrated approach for weighted networks. We demonstrate a manifold improvement in analysis opportunities with the generalized integrated approach using FV gradient weights for weight assignment, on a case study of the field `IT for engineering'. Integrated approach for weighted networks do not need additional implementation effort in PAJEK and this will be beneficial for a multitude of analysts and decision makers.},

@article{Xu:2017aa,
	abstract = {This paper provides an introduction to multi-source data fusion (MSDF) and comprehensively overviews the ingredients and challenges of MSDF in scientometrics. As compared to the MSDF methods in the sensor and other fields, and considering the features of scientometrics, in this paper an application model and procedure of MSDF in scientometrics are proposed. The model and procedure can be divided into three parts: data type integration, fusion of data relations, and ensemble clustering. Furthermore, the fusion of data relations can be divided into cross-integration of multi-mode data and matrix fusion of multi-relational data. To obtain a clearer and deeper analysis of the MSDF model, this paper further focuses on the application of MSDF in topic identification based on text analysis of scientific literatures. This paper also discusses the application of MSDF for the exploration of scientific literatures. Finally, the most suitable MSDF methods for different situations are discussed.},

@article{Glaser:2017aa,
	abstract = {Science studies are persistently challenged by the elusive structures of their subject matter, be it scientific knowledge or the various collectivities of researchers engaged with its production. Bibliometrics has responded by developing a strong and growing structural bibliometrics, which is concerned with delineating fields and identifying thematic structures. In the course of these developments, a concern emerged and is steadily growing. Do the sets of publications, authors or institutions we identify and visualise with our methods indeed represent thematic structures? To what extent are results of topic identification exercises determined by properties of knowledge structures, and to what extent are they determined by the approaches we use? Do we produce more than artefacts? These questions triggered the collective process of comparative topic identification reported in this special issue. The introduction traces the history of bibliometric approaches to topic identification, identifies the major challenges involved in these exercises, and introduces the contributions to the special issue.},
