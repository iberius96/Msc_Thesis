	abstract = {Proliferating applications of deep learning, along with the prevalence of large-scale text datasets, have revolutionized the natural language processing (NLP) field, thereby driving the recent explosive growth. Nevertheless, it is argued that state-of-the-art studies focus excessively on producing quantitative performances superior to existing models, by playing ``the Kaggle game.'' Hence, the field requires more effort in solving new problems and proposing novel approaches and architectures. We claim that one of the promising and constructive efforts would be to design transparent and accountable artificial intelligence (AI) systems for text analytics. By doing so, we can enhance the applicability and problem-solving capacity of the system for real-world decision support. It is widely accepted that deep learning models demonstrate remarkable performances compared to existing algorithms. However, they are often criticized for being less interpretable, i.e., the ``black box.'' In such cases, users tend to hesitate to utilize them for decision-making, especially in crucial tasks. Such complexity obstructs transparency and accountability of the overall system, potentially debilitating the deployment of decision support systems powered by AI. Furthermore, recent regulations are emphasizing fairness and transparency in algorithms to a greater extent, turning explanations more compulsory than voluntary. Thus, to enhance the transparency and accountability of the decision support system and preserve the capacity to model complex text data at the same time, we propose the Explaining and Visualizing Convolutional neural networks for Text information (EVCT) framework. By adopting and ameliorating cutting-edge methods in NLP and image processing, the EVCT framework provides a human-interpretable solution to the problem of text classification while minimizing information loss. Experimental results with large-scale, real-world datasets show that EVCT performs comparably to benchmark models, including widely used deep learning models. In addition, we provide instances of human-interpretable and relevant visualized explanations obtained from applying EVCT to the dataset and possible applications for real-world decision support.},

	abstract = {Consumer-generated content has provided an important new information medium for tourists, throughout the purchasing lifecycle, transforming the way that visitors evaluate, select and share experiences about tourism. Research in this area has largely focused on quantitative ratings provided on websites. However, advanced techniques for linguistic analysis provide the opportunity to extract meaning from the valuable comments provided by visitors. In this paper, we identify the key dimensions of customer service voiced by hotel visitors use a data mining approach, latent dirichlet analysis (LDA). The big data set includes 266,544 online reviews for 25,670 hotels located in 16 countries. LDA uncovers 19 controllable dimensions that are key for hotels to manage their interactions with visitors. We also find differences according to demographic segments. Perceptual mapping further identifies the most important dimensions according to the star-rating of hotels. We conclude with the implications of our study for future research and practice.},

	abstract = {The ability to detect and rapidly respond to the presence of safety defects is vital to firms and to regulatory agencies. In this paper, we employ a text mining methodology to generate industry-specific ``smoke terms'' for identifying these defects in the countertop appliances and over-the-counter medicine industries. Building upon prior work, we propose several methodological improvements to enhance the precision of our industry-specific terms. First, we replace the subjective manual curation of these terms with an automated Tabu search algorithm, which provides a statistically significant improvement over a sample of human-curated lists. Contrary to the assumptions of prior work, we find that shorter, targeted smoke term lists produce superior precision. Second, we incorporate non-textual review features to enhance the performance of these smoke term lists. In total, we find greater than a twofold improvement over typical human-curated lists. As safety surveillance is vital across industries, our method has great potential to assist firms and regulatory agencies in identifying and responding quickly to safety defects.},

	abstract = {Sentiment topic models are used as unsupervised methods to solve the specific problems of the general aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) problem. One of the main problems of the technique is its substandard aspect term extraction, which leads to difficulties in aspect label determination. This paper is focused on improving the aspect term extraction of topic models by incorporating product descriptions to the current state-of-the-art sentiment topic model, Aspect Sentiment Unification Model (ASUM). We present two models that extend from ASUM differently to leverage on the information found in the product description: Seller-aided Aspect-based Sentiment Model (SA-ASM) and Seller-aided Product-based Sentiment Model (SA-PSM). SA-ASM has its topic distribution inside the review while SA-PSM has its topic distribution inside the product description. Based on experiments conducted to reviews of laptops and mobile phones, results show that SA-ASM performs better in micro-level problems such as sentiment classification and aspect assignment and SA-PSM performs better in macro-level problems like aspect category detection. Both models achieve better performances compared to current topic modeling methods for the ABSA problem.},

	abstract = {Product defects can have a devastating impact on a firm's sales and reputation, especially in the era of social media. The early detection of defects could not only protect consumers from financial losses, but could also mitigate financial damage to the manufacturer. Previous work in automated defect discovery has had success in the automotive, consumer electronics, and toy industries, but so far there has been no application to home appliances. In this study, we extend the text analytic framework conceived in earlier work to the discovery of underperformance in large home appliances, specifically dishwashers. We find that generic cross-domain sentiment techniques can be strongly complemented by domain-specific ``smoke'' and ``sparkle'' term lists that are highly correlated with potential defects. These findings can be highly beneficial to improving dishwasher appliance quality management methods.},

	abstract = {Defects in baby cribs and related products can cause injuries and deaths, and they cost manufacturers and distributors millions of dollars in fines and legal fees and even more in losses of sales and brand image. There has been no prior research regarding automated defect discovery from online reviews of baby cribs, and prior safety defect discovery methods designed and calibrated for other industries must be adapted. We aim to determine which words and phrases are indicators of defects in online reviews and whether sentiment analysis is sufficient for automated defect discovery in the baby crib industry. We find that sentiment analysis serves as a useful tool for automated defect discovery in the baby crib industry and create a supplementary set of ``smoke terms'' that are strong indicators of safety defects in online reviews of baby cribs. Using our term-based scoring method, we observe a 59% improvement in precision and a 60% improvement in recall when compared to the top-performing prior sentiment method. Our findings provide actionable insights into how analysis of online reviews and other social media can improve baby crib quality management techniques. These terms can be used with immediate effect to monitor and more rapidly identify defects and rectify them before injuries or deaths occur.},

@article{PESSACH2020113290,
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a comprehensive analytics framework that can serve as a decision support tool for HR recruiters in real-world settings in order to improve hiring and placement decisions. The proposed framework follows two main phases: a local prediction scheme for recruitments' success at the level of a single job placement, and a mathematical model that provides a global recruitment optimization scheme for the organization, taking into account multilevel considerations. In the first phase, a key property of the proposed prediction approach is the interpretability of the machine learning (ML) model, which in this case is obtained by applying the Variable-Order Bayesian Network (VOBN) model to the recruitment data. Specifically, we used a uniquely large dataset that contains recruitment records of hundreds of thousands of employees over a decade and represents a wide range of heterogeneous populations. Our analysis shows that the VOBN model can provide both high accuracy and interpretability insights to HR professionals. Moreover, we show that using the interpretable VOBN can lead to unexpected and sometimes counter-intuitive insights that might otherwise be overlooked by recruiters who rely on conventional methods. We demonstrate that it is feasible to predict the successful placement of a candidate in a specific position at a pre-hire stage and utilize predictions to devise a global optimization model. Our results show that in comparison to actual recruitment decisions, the devised framework is capable of providing a balanced recruitment plan while improving both diversity and recruitment success rates, despite the inherent trade-off between the two.},

Traditionally, customers are not very much involved in product innovation processes. With the technology of Web 2.0, online users are enabled and motivated to provide reviews and discussions about product features and use experiences. User generated product reviews have been found to have a word-of-mouth effect as a new element of marketing communication. However, their implication on improving product innovation cycles have not been studied before. Guided by a persuasion theory, we extracted the central and peripheral persuasion cues from user generated reviews and examined their impact on mobile app developers' product innovation decisions. Using data collected from the Google App store, our empirical study shows that long and easy-to-read user reviews with mildly negative reviews can increase the likelihood of a future mobile app update. Our findings highlight the need for researchers to explore user generated reviews in the context of customer-centered product innovation.},

	abstract = {Widespread adoption of automated decision making by artificial intelligence (AI) is witnessed due to specular advances in computation power and improvements in optimization algorithms especially in machine learning (ML). Complex ML models provide good prediction accuracy; however, the opacity of ML models does not provide sufficient assurance for their adoption in the automation of lending decisions. This paper presents an explainable AI decision-support-system to automate the loan underwriting process by belief-rule-base (BRB). This system can accommodate human knowledge and can also learn from historical data by supervised learning. The hierarchical structure of BRB can accommodates factual and heuristic rules. The system can explain the chain of events leading to a decision for a loan application by the importance of an activated rule and the contribution of antecedent attributes in the rule. A business case study on automation of mortgage underwriting is demonstrated to show that the BRB system can provide a good trade-off between accuracy and explainability. The textual explanation produced by the activation of rules could be used as a reason for denial of a loan. The decision-making process for an application can be comprehended by the significance of rules in providing the decision and contribution of its antecedent attributes.},

	abstract = {Consumer recommendations of products and services are important performance indicators for organizations to gain feedback on their offerings. Furthermore, they are important for prospective customers to learn from prior consumer experiences. In this study, we focus on user-generated content, in particular online reviews, to investigate which service aspects are evaluated by consumers and how these factors explain a consumer's recommendation. Further, we investigate how recommendations can be predicted automatically based on such user-driven responses. We disentangle the recommendation decision by performing explanatory and predictive analyses focusing on a sample of airline reviews. We identify core and augmented service aspects expressed in the online review. We then show that service aspect-specific sentiment indicators drive the decision to recommend an airline and that these factors can be incorporated in a predictive model using data mining techniques. We also find that the business model of an airline being reviewed, whether low cost or full service, is also an applicable consideration. Our results are highly relevant for practitioners to analyze and act on consumer feedback in a prompt manner, along with the ability of gaining a deeper understanding of the service from multiple aspects. Also, potential travelers can benefit from this approach by getting an aggregated view on service quality.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, studies observe a continuous decline in university enrollment and retention rates resulting in millions of dollars in lost revenue. Past research shows that 95% of the students rely heavily on the positive word-of-mouth to select a college. Especially, with the advent of Web 2.0 tools, students are able to make informed decisions due to increased awareness through online reviews. Academic institutions can also leverage this information to understand and improve their students' perception. The objective of this paper is to identify the current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of a university by analyzing online student reviews using text analytics. Our proposed approach integrates four different techniques: topic modeling, sentiment analysis, root cause and SWOT analyses. First, we introduce an ensemble of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (E-LDA) topic models to automatically identify the key features (topics) that are predominantly discussed by students and categorize each review sentence into the most related topic. We then detect the opinion associated with each sentence (positive, negative and neutral) using sentiment analysis. Finally, a topic-based opinion summary (TOS) for a university is established to identify its strengths and weaknesses from the students' perspective, and the opportunities and threats are determined by analyzing the TOS of the competitors (or other similar institutions). A case study is used to illustrate the feasibility and application of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed method provides an efficient and economic performance summary of a university and its competitors, and could help its leaders in recruitment and retention efforts.},

The findings show that there are huge discrepancies in the representation of the hotel industry on these platforms. Particularly, online reviews vary considerably in terms of their linguistic characteristics, semantic features, sentiment, rating, usefulness as well as the relationships between these features. This study offers a basis for understanding the methodological challenges and identifies several research directions for social media analytics in hospitality and tourism.},

	abstract = {Online reviews contain many vital insights for quality management, but the volume of content makes identifying defect-related discussion difficult. This paper critically assesses multiple approaches for detecting defect-related discussion, ranging from out-of-the-box sentiment analyses to supervised and unsupervised machine-learned defect terms. We examine reviews from 25 product and service categories to assess each method's performance. We examine each approach across the broad cross-section of categories as well as when tailored to a singular category of study. Surprisingly, we found that negative sentiment was often a poor predictor of defect-related discussion. Terms generated with unsupervised topic modeling tended to correspond to generic product discussions rather than defect-related discussion. Supervised learning techniques outperformed the other text analytic techniques in our cross-category analysis, and they were especially effective when confined to a single category of study. Our work suggests a need for category-specific text analyses to take full advantage of consumer-driven quality intelligence.},

	abstract = {Online reviews contain a plethora of useful information that plays a vital role in consumer choices and provides a dominant reference for enterprises to adopt strategies for product development and improvement. The paper examines the www.zol.com.cnwebsite as a source of information and Huawei Mate phones as a research target, processes the data of consumers'online reviews on three types of Huawei Mate phones, discusses the correlations between online reviews and phone improvement, and proposes some suggestions for future product improvement. This empirical study shows that the correlation between the change in the degree of feature satisfaction and phone improvement is strong; the correlation between the change in the degree of feature satisfaction and product improvement is stronger than that between the change in the degree of feature attention and product improvement. Enterprises can determine the direction and contents of phone improvement based on information from reviews on its preceding phone model. This study can help enterprises master market requirements, understand consumers'behaviour and improve the quality and efficiency of product innovation.},

@article{ZHANG2021102389,
	abstract = {The importance of online customer reviews to product innovation has been well-recognized in prior literature. Mining online reviews has received extensive attention and efforts. Most existing research on mining online reviews focus on issues such as the impact of reviews on sales, helpfulness of reviews, and customers' participation in reviews. Few research studies, however, seek to identify and extract innovation ideas for products from online reviews. This type of information is particularly important for product functionality improvement and new feature development from a manufacturer's perspective. Mining product innovation ideas allows a manufacturer to proactively review customer opinion and unlock insights about new functionality and features that the market expects, in order to gain a competitive advantage. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach to identify sentences that contain innovation ideas from online reviews. Specifically, we develop a novel ensemble embedding method to generate semantic and contextual representations of the words in review sentences. The resultant representations in each sentence are then used in a long short-term memory (LSTM) model for innovation-sentence identification. Moreover, we adopt a focal loss function in our model to address the class imbalance problem. We validate our approach with a dataset of 10,000 customer reviews from Amazon. Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.91 and an F1 score of 0.89, outperforming a set of state-of-the-art baseline models in the comparison. Our approach can be extended and applied to many other information extraction tasks.},
