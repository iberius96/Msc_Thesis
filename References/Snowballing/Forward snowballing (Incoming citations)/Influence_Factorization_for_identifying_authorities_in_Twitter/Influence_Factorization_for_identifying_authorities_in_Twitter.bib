@article{firdaniza_information_2021,
	abstract = {Information diffusion, information spread, and influencers are important concepts in many studies on social media, especially Twitter analytics. However, literature overviews on the information diffusion of Twitter analytics are sparse, especially on the use of continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). This paper examines the following topics: (1) the purposes of studies about information diffusion on Twitter, (2) the methods adopted to model information diffusion on Twitter, (3) the metrics applied, and (4) measures used to determine influencer rankings. We employed a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore the studies related to information diffusion on Twitter extracted from four digital libraries. In this paper, a two-stage analysis was conducted. First, we implemented a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and R-bibliometrix software. This approach was applied to select 204 papers after conducting a duplication check and assessing the inclusion--exclusion criteria. At this stage, we mapped the authors' collaborative networks/collaborators and the evolution of research themes. Second, we analyzed the gap in research themes on the application of CTMC information diffusion on Twitter. Further filtering criteria were applied, and 34 papers were analyzed to identify the research objectives, methods, metrics, and measures used by each researcher. Nonhomogeneous CTMC has never been used in Twitter information diffusion modeling. This finding motivates us to further study nonhomogeneous CTMC as a modeling approach for Twitter information diffusion.},

@article{university_of_computer_studies_detecting_2020,
	abstract = {Social media has become a popular platform to post or share personal information, opinion, photos, videos, etc. Detection of influential users is a significant problem in information diffusion or propagation. Previous researches find influential users based on follower or retweet relationships and centrality measurement approaches. In this paper, influential users are detected by network topology that was obtained from communication relationships among users, link analysis approach, and user's profile features. The proposed approach aims to detect trending topic influencers. Firstly, communication relationships namely retweet, mention, and reply between users in a trending topic are extracted and a trending topic graph is constructed. Secondly, influential users are detected using a link analysis approach combined with the ability of users' profile features. The performance of the system can be proved to compare with influencer detection methods. The experimental result shows that the trending topic influencers can detect using the interaction relationships and user's features.},

Analyzing more than 1.6 million of tweets, we propose a matrix that can be used to characterize an influencer. This matrix has 2 dimensions on one hand the five courses of actions an influencer can use and on the other hand the 3 types of motivation he has got. Regarding the methodology we used R and a qualitative content analysis and provided our scripts. This research is a part of the ``lockdown lab'' project.},

@article{wu_survey_2022,
	abstract = {{\textless}abstract{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}With the development of complex network theory, many phenomena on complex networks, such as infectious disease transmission, information spreading and transportation management, can be explained by temporal network dynamics, to reveal the evolution of the real world. Due to the failure of equipment for collecting data, human subjectivity, and false decisions made by machines when the high accuracy is required, data from temporal networks is usually incomplete, which makes the samples unrepresentative and the model analysis more challenging. This survey concentrates on the pre-processing strategies of incomplete data and overviews two categories of methods on data imputation and prediction, respectively. According to whether each layer in temporal networks has the coupling process, this survey overviews the dynamic modeling approaches in terms of both a single process and coupling processes on complex temporal networks. Moreover, for complex temporal networks with incomplete data, this survey summarizes various characteristic analysis methods, which concentrate on critical nodes identification, network reconstruction, network recoverity, and criticality. Finally, some future directions are discussed for temporal networks dynamics with incomplete data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/abstract{\textgreater}},
