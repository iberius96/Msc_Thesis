	abstract = {Teacher education enables students to grow from `novice' into `starting expert' teachers. In this study, students' textual peer feedback on video recordings of their teaching practice was analysed to determine the growth of their expertise in relation to blended curriculum design. The degree to which curriculum and literature influenced their feedback was assessed by semantic network analysis of prominent words from the literature that was studied, as well as the lexical richness and semantic cohesion of students' peer feedback and reflections. The lexical richness and the semantic cohesion increased significantly by the end of the semester. This means that students incorporated new vocabulary and maintained semantic consistency while using the new words. Regarding the semantic network analysis, we found stronger connections between the topics being discussed by the students at the end of the semester. Active use of video and peer feedback enhances students' active knowledge base, thus furthering effective teaching.},

@article{gao_characteristics_2021,
	abstract = {Background
              Although government agencies acknowledge that messages about the adverse health effects of e-cigarette use should be promoted on social media, effectively delivering those health messages is challenging. Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms among US youth and young adults, and it has been used to educate the public about the potential harm of vaping through antivaping posts.
            
            
              Objective
              We aim to analyze the characteristics of and user engagement with antivaping posts on Instagram to inform future message development and information delivery.
            
            
              Methods
              A total of 11,322 Instagram posts were collected from November 18, 2019, to January 2, 2020, by using antivaping hashtags including \#novape, \#novaping, \#stopvaping, \#dontvape, \#antivaping, \#quitvaping, \#antivape, \#stopjuuling, \#dontvapeonthepizza, and \#escapethevape. Among those posts, 1025 posts were randomly selected and 500 antivaping posts were further identified by hand coding. The image type, image content, and account type of antivaping posts were hand coded, the text information in the caption was explored by topic modeling, and the user engagement of each category was compared.
            
            
              Results
              Analyses found that antivaping images of the educational/warning type were the most common (253/500; 50.6\%). The average likes of the educational/warning type (15 likes/post) were significantly lower than the catchphrase image type (these emphasized a slogan such as ``athletesdontvape'' in the image; 32.5 likes/post; P{\textless}.001). The majority of the antivaping posts contained the image content element text (n=332, 66.4\%), followed by the image content element people/person (n=110, 22\%). The images containing people/person elements (32.8 likes/post) had more likes than the images containing other elements (13.8-21.1 likes/post). The captions of the antivaping Instagram posts covered topics including ``lung health,'' ``teen vaping,'' ``stop vaping,'' and ``vaping death cases.'' Among the 500 antivaping Instagram posts, while most posts were from the antivaping community (n=177, 35.4\%) and personal account types (n=182, 36.4\%), the antivaping community account type had the highest average number of posts (1.69 posts/account). However, there was no difference in the number of likes among different account types.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Multiple features of antivaping Instagram posts may be related to user engagement and perception. This study identified the critical elements associated with high user engagement, which could be used to design antivaping posts to deliver health-related information more efficiently.},

The algorithms available in the field of data mining also provide a variety of new innovations regarding data mining. This increases the interest of the researchers to develop many essential models in the field of text data mining. In the proposed model is a two step text document clustering approach by K-Means algorithm. The first step includes Pre\_Processing and second step includes clustering process. For Pre-Processing the method performs the tokenization approach. The distinct words are identified and the distinct words frequency of occurrence, TFIDF weights of the occurrences are calculated to form a document feature vector separately. In the clustering phase the feature vector is clustered by performing K-means algorithm by implementing various similarity measures.},

@techreport{gao_perspective_2020,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND
            Previous studies indicated electronic cigarette users might be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infections and could develop more severe symptoms once contracted COVID-19 due to their impaired immune responses to virus infections. Social media has been widely used to express users' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
          
          
            OBJECTIVE
            We aimed to examine the responses of electronic cigarette Twitter users to the COVID-19 pandemic using Twitter data.
          
          
            METHODS
            The COVID-19 dataset contained COVID-19-related Twitter posts (tweets) between March 5th, 2020 and April 3rd, 2020. Ecig group included Twitter users who didn't have commercial accounts but ever retweeted e-cigarette promotion posts between May 2019 and August 2019. Twitter users who didn't post or retweet any e-cigarette-related tweets were defined as Non-Ecig group. Sentiment analysis was conducted to compare sentiment scores towards the COVID-19 pandemic between both groups. Topic modeling was used to compare the main topics discussed between the two groups.
          
          
            RESULTS
            The US COVID-19 dataset consisted of 1,112,558 COVID-19-related tweets from 15,657 unique Twitter users in the Ecig group and 9,789,584 COVID-19-related tweets from 2,128,942 unique Twitter users in the Non-Ecig group. Sentiment analysis showed that the Ecig group have more negative sentiment scores than the Non-Ecig group. Results from topic modeling indicated the Ecig group had more concern about COVID-19 related death, while the Non-Ecig group cared more about the government's responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS
            Electronic cigarette Twitter users has more concern towards the COVID-19 pandemic. Twitter is a useful tool to timely monitor public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.},

@article{lu_how_2022,
	abstract = {The rise of cyberbullying has been of great concern for the general public. This study aims to explore public attitudes towards cyberbullying on Chinese social media. Cognition and emotion are important components of attitude, and this study innovatively used text analysis to extract the cognition and emotion of the posts. We used a web crawler to collect 53,526 posts related to cyberbullying in Chinese on Sina Weibo in a month, where emotions were detected using the software ``Text Mind'', a Chinese linguistic psychological text analysis system, and the content analysis was performed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model. Sentiment analysis showed the frequency of negative emotion words was the highest in the posts; the frequency of anger, anxiety, and sadness words decreased in turn. The topic model analysis identified three common topics about cyberbullying: critiques on cyberbullying and support for its victims, rational expressions of anger and celebrity worship, and calls for further control. In summary, this study quantitatively reveals the negative attitudes of the Chinese public toward cyberbullying and conveys specific public concerns via three common topics. This will help us to better understand the demands of the Chinese public so that targeted support can be proposed to curb cyberbullying.},

@article{rudiger_topic_2022,
	abstract = {Topic modeling is a popular technique for exploring large document collections. It has proven useful for this task, but its application poses a number of challenges. First, the comparison of available algorithms is anything but simple, as researchers use many different datasets and criteria for their evaluation. A second challenge is the choice of a suitable metric for evaluating the calculated results. The metrics used so far provide a mixed picture, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of topic modeling outputs. Altogether, the choice of an appropriate algorithm and the evaluation of the results remain unresolved issues. Although many studies have reported promising performance by various topic models, prior research has not yet systematically investigated the validity of the outcomes in a comprehensive manner, that is, using more than a small number of the available algorithms and metrics. Consequently, our study has two main objectives. First, we compare all commonly used, non-application-specific topic modeling algorithms and assess their relative performance. The comparison is made against a known clustering and thus enables an unbiased evaluation of results. Our findings show a clear ranking of the algorithms in terms of accuracy. Secondly, we analyze the relationship between existing metrics and the known clustering, and thus objectively determine under what conditions these algorithms may be utilized effectively. This way, we enable readers to gain a deeper understanding of the performance of topic modeling techniques and the interplay of performance and evaluation metrics.},

@article{gao_electronic_2021,
	abstract = {Background
              Previous studies have shown that electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) users might be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and could develop more severe symptoms if they contract the disease owing to their impaired immune responses to viral infections. Social media platforms such as Twitter have been widely used by individuals worldwide to express their responses to the current COVID-19 pandemic.
            
            
              Objective
              In this study, we aimed to examine the longitudinal changes in the attitudes of Twitter users who used e-cigarettes toward the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as compare differences in attitudes between e-cigarette users and nonusers based on Twitter data.
            
            
              Methods
              The study dataset containing COVID-19--related Twitter posts (tweets) posted between March 5 and April 3, 2020, was collected using a Twitter streaming application programming interface with COVID-19--related keywords. Twitter users were classified into two groups: Ecig group, including users who did not have commercial accounts but posted e-cigarette--related tweets between May 2019 and August 2019, and non-Ecig group, including users who did not post any e-cigarette--related tweets. Sentiment analysis was performed to compare sentiment scores towards the COVID-19 pandemic between both groups and determine whether the sentiment expressed was positive, negative, or neutral. Topic modeling was performed to compare the main topics discussed between the groups.
            
            
              Results
              The US COVID-19 dataset consisted of 4,500,248 COVID-19--related tweets collected from 187,399 unique Twitter users in the Ecig group and 11,479,773 COVID-19--related tweets collected from 2,511,659 unique Twitter users in the non-Ecig group. Sentiment analysis showed that Ecig group users had more negative sentiment scores than non-Ecig group users. Results from topic modeling indicated that Ecig group users had more concerns about deaths due to COVID-19, whereas non-Ecig group users cared more about the government's responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings show that Twitter users who tweeted about e-cigarettes had more concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings can inform public health practitioners to use social media platforms such as Twitter for timely monitoring of public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and educating and encouraging current e-cigarette users to quit vaping to minimize the risks associated with COVID-19.},

@article{gao_investigating_2022,
	abstract = {Background
              On May 18, 2020, the New York State Department of Health implemented a statewide flavor ban to prohibit the sales of all flavored vapor products, except for tobacco or any other authorized flavor.
            
            
              Objective
              This study aims to investigate the discussion changes in e-cigarette--related tweets over time with the implementation of the New York State flavor ban.
            
            
              Methods
              Through the Twitter streaming application programming interface, 59,883 e-cigarette--related tweets were collected within the New York State from February 6, 2020, to May 17, 2020 (period 1, before the implementation of the flavor ban), May 18, 2020-June 30, 2020 (period 2, between the implementation of the flavor ban and the online sales ban), July 1, 2020-September 15, 2020 (period 3, the short term after the online sales ban), and September 16, 2020-November 30, 2020 (period 4, the long term after the online sales ban). Sentiment analysis and topic modeling were conducted to investigate the changes in public attitudes and discussions in e-cigarette--related tweets. The popularity of different e-cigarette flavor categories was compared before and after the implementation of the New York State flavor ban.
            
            
              Results
              Our results showed that the proportion of e-cigarette--related tweets with negative sentiment significantly decreased (4305/13,246, 32.5\% vs 3855/14,455, 26.67\%, P{\textless}.001), and tweets with positive sentiment significantly increased (5246/13,246, 39.6\% vs 7038/14,455, 48.69\%, P{\textless}.001) in period 4 compared to period 3. ``Teens and nicotine products'' was the most frequently discussed e-cigarette--related topic in the negative tweets. In contrast, ``nicotine products and quitting'' was more prevalent in positive tweets. The proportion of tweets mentioning mint and menthol flavors significantly increased right after the flavor ban and decreased to lower levels over time. The proportions of fruit and sweet flavors were most frequently mentioned in period 1, decreased in period 2, and dominated again in period 4.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The proportion of e-cigarette--related tweets with different attitudes and frequently discussed flavor categories changed over time after the implementation of the New York State ban of flavored vaping products. This change indicated a potential impact of the flavor ban on public discussions of flavored e-cigarettes.},

	abstract = {Mass media is one of the most important elements influencing the information environment of society. The mass media is not only a source of information about what is happening but is often the authority that shapes the information agenda, the boundaries, and forms of discussion on socially relevant topics. A multifaceted and, where possible, quantitative assessment of mass media performance is crucial for understanding their objectivity, tone, thematic focus and, quality. The paper presents a corpus of Kazakhstan media, which contains over 4 million publications from 36 primary sources (which has at least 500 publications). The corpus also includes more than 2 million texts of Russian media for comparative analysis of publication activity of the countries, also about 4000 sections of state policy documents. The paper briefly describes the natural language processing and multiple-criteria decision-making methods, which are the algorithmic basis of the text and mass media evaluation method, and describes the results of several research cases, such as identification of propaganda, assessment of the tone of publications, calculation of the level of socially relevant negativity, comparative analysis of publication activity in the field of renewable energy. Experiments confirm the general possibility of evaluating the socially significant news, identifying texts with propagandistic content, evaluating the sentiment of publications using the topic model of the text corpus since the area under receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC AUC) values of 0.81, 0.73 and 0.93 were achieved on abovementioned tasks. The described cases do not exhaust the possibilities of thematic, tonal, dynamic, etc., analysis of the considered corpus of texts. The corpus will be interesting to researchers considering both multiple publications and mass media analysis, including comparative analysis and identification of common patterns inherent in the media of different countries.},

The main problem is the lack of a stable metric of the quality of topics obtained during the construction of topic models. The authors analyzed from previous works, most of the models used in determining the number of topics are non-parametric and the quality of topics determined by using perplexity and coherence measures and concluded that they are not applicable in solving this problem. In this paper, we used the parametric method, which is an extension of the traditional topic model with visual access tendency for visualization of the number of topics (clusters) to complement clustering and to choose the optimal number of topics based on results of cluster validity indices. Developed hybrid topic models are demonstrated with different Twitter datasets on various topics in obtaining the optimal number of topics and in measuring the quality of clusters. The experimental results showed that the Visual Non-negative Matrix Factorization (VNMF) topic model performs well in determining the optimal number of topics with interactive visualization and in performance measure of the quality of clusters with validity indices.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
            Although government agencies acknowledge that messages about the adverse health effects of e-cigarette use should be promoted on social media, effectively delivering those health messages is challenging. Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms among US youth and young adults, and it has been used to educate the public about the potential harm of vaping through antivaping posts.
          
          
            OBJECTIVE
            We aim to analyze the characteristics of and user engagement with antivaping posts on Instagram to inform future message development and information delivery.
          
          
            METHODS
            A total of 11,322 Instagram posts were collected from November 18, 2019, to January 2, 2020, by using antivaping hashtags including \#novape, \#novaping, \#stopvaping, \#dontvape, \#antivaping, \#quitvaping, \#antivape, \#stopjuuling, \#dontvapeonthepizza, and \#escapethevape. Among those posts, 1025 posts were randomly selected and 500 antivaping posts were further identified by hand coding. The image type, image content, and account type of antivaping posts were hand coded, the text information in the caption was explored by topic modeling, and the user engagement of each category was compared.
          
          
            RESULTS
            Analyses found that antivaping images of the \textit{educational/warning} type were the most common (253/500; 50.6\%). The average likes of the \textit{educational/warning} type (15 likes/post) were significantly lower than the \textit{catchphrase} image type (these emphasized a slogan such as ``athletesdontvape'' in the image; 32.5 likes/post; \textit{P}\&lt;.001). The majority of the antivaping posts contained the image content element \textit{text} (n=332, 66.4\%), followed by the image content element \textit{people/person} (n=110, 22\%). The images containing \textit{people/person} elements (32.8 likes/post) had more likes than the images containing other elements (13.8-21.1 likes/post). The captions of the antivaping Instagram posts covered topics including ``lung health,'' ``teen vaping,'' ``stop vaping,'' and ``vaping death cases.'' Among the 500 antivaping Instagram posts, while most posts were from the \textit{antivaping community} (n=177, 35.4\%) and \textit{personal} account types (n=182, 36.4\%), the \textit{antivaping community} account type had the highest average number of posts (1.69 posts/account). However, there was no difference in the number of likes among different account types.
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS
            Multiple features of antivaping Instagram posts may be related to user engagement and perception. This study identified the critical elements associated with high user engagement, which could be used to design antivaping posts to deliver health-related information more efficiently.},
