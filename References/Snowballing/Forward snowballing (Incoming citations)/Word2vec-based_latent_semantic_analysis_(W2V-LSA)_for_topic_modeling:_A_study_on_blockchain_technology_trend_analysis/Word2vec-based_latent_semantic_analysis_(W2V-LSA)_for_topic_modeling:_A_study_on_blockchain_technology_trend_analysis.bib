@article{zheng_research_2022,
	abstract = {In recent years, with the increase of social investment in scientific research, the number of research results in various fields has increased significantly. Cross-disciplinary research results have gradually become an emerging frontier research direction. There is a certain dependence between a large number of research results. It is difficult to effectively analyze today's scientific research results when looking at a single research field in isolation. How to effectively use the huge number of scientific papers to help researchers becomes a challenge. This paper introduces the research status at home and abroad in terms of domain information mining and topic evolution law of scientific and technological papers from three aspects: the semantic feature representation learning of scientific and technological papers, the field information mining of scientific and technological papers, and the mining and prediction of research topic evolution rules of scientific and technological papers.},

@article{daoud_topical_2022,
	abstract = {Questions are crucial expressions in any language. Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Natural Language Understanding (NLU) applications, such as question-answering computer systems, automatic chatting apps (chatbots), digital virtual assistants, and opinion mining, can benefit from accurately identifying similar questions in an effective manner. We detail methods for identifying similarities between Arabic questions that have been posted online by Internet users and organizations. Our novel approach uses a non-topical rule-based methodology and topical information (textual similarity, lexical similarity, and semantic similarity) to determine if a pair of Arabic questions are similarly paraphrased. Our method counts the lexical and linguistic distances between each question. Additionally, it identifies questions in accordance with their format and scope using expert hypotheses (rules) that have been experimentally shown to be useful and practical. Even if there is a high degree of lexical similarity between a When question (Timex Factoid---inquiring about time) and a Who inquiry (Enamex Factoid---asking about a named entity), they will not be similar. In an experiment using 2200 question pairs, our method attained an accuracy of 0.85, which is remarkable given the simplicity of the solution and the fact that we did not employ any language models or word embedding. In order to cover common Arabic queries presented by Arabic Internet users, we gathered the questions from various online forums and resources. In this study, we describe a unique method for detecting question similarity that does not require intensive processing, a sizable linguistic corpus, or a costly semantic repository. Because there are not many rich Arabic textual resources, this is especially important for informal Arabic text processing on the Internet.},

@article{huang_psychological_2021,
	abstract = {Online mental health service (OMHS) platforms have contributed significantly to the public's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. However, it remains unclear why the public used OMHS platforms for psychological help-seeking (PHS) behavior and how PHS behavior varied across different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the ecological PHS behavior data from two OMHS platforms, we extracted population, psychological problems, and influential factors of PHS behavior by text mining and time series analysis methods. Seven top-ranked psychological problems (i.e., depression and anxiety, lack of interest, suicidal tendencies, social phobia, feelings of being worried and afraid, suffering, anger) and seven influential factors (i.e., interpersonal relationships, love, family, work, psychotherapy, personal characteristics, marriage) were found. The online PHS behaviors related to different psychological problems and influential factors remained a growing trend before 2020 and have been increasing significantly due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Four main stages were found during the pandemic according to the changes in the online PHS population: sharp growth, significant decline, slight rebound, and slow decline. This study identified large-scale, spontaneous PHS behaviors among the online public during the COVID-19 pandemic and the various psychological problems and influential factors that varied across different stages of the pandemic, suggesting that the government and health practitioners should adopt effective policies and strategies to prevent and intervene in mental health problems for the online public.},

@article{wahid_topic2features_2021,
	abstract = {In supervised machine learning, specifically in classification tasks, selecting and analyzing the feature vector to achieve better results is one of the most important tasks. Traditional methods such as comparing the features' cosine similarity and exploring the datasets manually to check which feature vector is suitable is relatively time consuming. Many classification tasks failed to achieve better classification results because of poor feature vector selection and sparseness of data. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework, topic2features (T2F), to deal with short and sparse data using the topic distributions of hidden topics gathered from dataset and converting into feature vectors to build supervised classifier. For this we leveraged the unsupervised topic modelling LDA (latent dirichlet allocation) approach to retrieve the topic distributions employed in supervised learning algorithms. We made use of labelled data and topic distributions of hidden topics that were generated from that data. We explored how the representation based on topics affect the classification performance by applying supervised classification algorithms. Additionally, we did careful evaluation on two types of datasets and compared them with baseline approaches without topic distributions and other comparable methods. The results show that our framework performs significantly better in terms of classification performance compared to the baseline(without T2F) approaches and also yields improvement in terms of F1 score compared to other compared approaches.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This study aims to clarify the risk management practices of banks as supply chain finance (SCF) service providers.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Using 4,014 evaluation and approval reports, this study constructed five risk management factors and examined their functions with secondary data. Two text-mining techniques (i.e. word sense induction, TF--IDF) were used to equip the classic routine of dictionary-based content analysis.
            
            
              Findings
              This research successfully identified four important risk management factors: relationship-based assessment, asset monitoring, cash flow monitoring and supply chain collaboration. The default-preventing effect of these factors are different and contingent on the type of financing contexts (i.e. preshipment, postshipment).
            
            
              Practical implications
              The empirical evidences provide practical implications for SCF service providers to manage risk. SCF service providers are suggested to pay more attention to cash flow monitoring when providing postshipment financing services and shift the focus to relationship building and supply chain collaboration when providing preshipment financing services.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The study shows that a large volume of textual materials can provide adequate clues for researches as long as they are mined with suitable analytic techniques and approaches. Based on the results, SCF service providers can identify problems of their operations and directions for improvement. In addition, the risk management vocabulary from the E\&A reports can be utilized by SCF service providers to digitize their loan approving process and, further, to facilitate the decision-makings.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to conduct topic modeling and sentiment analysis on the posts of Skytrax (airlinequality.com), where there are many interests and participation of the people who have used or are willing to use it for airlines. The purpose of people gathering at Skytrax is to make better choices using the actual experiences of other customers who have experienced airlines. Online reviews written by customers with experience using airlines in Asia were collected. The data collected were online reviews from 27 airlines, with more than 14,000 reviews. Topic modeling and sentiment analysis were used with the collected data to figure out what kinds of important words are in the online reviews. As a result of the topic modeling, `seat', `service', and `meal' were significant issues in the flight through frequency analysis. Additionally, the result revealed that delay was the main issue, which can affect customer dissatisfaction while `staff service' can make customers satisfied through sentiment analysis as the result shows the `staff service' with meal and food in the topic modeling.},

This has resulted in a tremendous availability of research literature, which keeps evolving itself. Thus, identification of core research areas and trends in such ever-evolving literature is not only challenging but interesting too. An empirical overview of contemporary machine learning methods, which have the potential to expedite evidence synthesis within research literature, has been explained. This manuscript proposes Simulating Expert comprehension for Analyzing Research trends (SEAR) framework, which can perform subjective and quantitative investigation over enormous literature. TRENDMINER is the use case designed exclusively for the SEAR framework. TRENDMINER uncovered the intellectual structure of a corpus of 444 abstracts of research articles (published during 2010--2019) on Android malware analysis and detection. The study concludes with the identification of three core research areas, twenty-seven research trends. The study also suggests the potential future research directions.},

@article{yaman_automated_2022,
	abstract = {Patent literature research has a high scientific value for the industrial, commercial, legal, and policymaking communities. Therefore, patent analysis has become crucial. Patent topic classification is an important process in patent topic modeling analysis. However, the classification process is time-consuming and expensive, as it is usually carried out manually by an expert. Moreover, a patent document may be categorised in more than one category or label, further complicating the task. As the number of patent documents submitted increases, creating an automated patent classification system that yields accurate results becomes increasingly critical. Therefore, in this paper, we analyse the performance of two algorithms with regard to multi-label classification in patent documents: multi-label k-nearest neighbor (ML-KNN) and classifier chain k-nearest neighbor (CC-KNN), combined with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). These two methods have a considerable advantage in handling the continuously updated dataset; they also exhibit superior performance compared to other multi-label learning algorithms. This study also compares these two algorithms with the term frequency (TF)-weighting measure. The optimal value obtained is based on the following evaluation parameters: micro F1, accuracy, Hamming loss, and one error. The result shows that the ML-KNN method is better than the CC-KNN method and that the multi-label classification based on topics (patent LDA) is better than the TF-weighting technique.},

To find out the same type of category and resource utilization of applications, researchers must adopt manual working. To reduce their efforts, a solution has been proposed that works in two phases. In first phase, a semantic analysis-based keywords and variables identification process has been proposed. Based on the semantics, designed a dataset having two classes: one represents application type and the other corresponds to application keywords. Afterward, in second phase, input preprocessed dataset to manifold machine learning techniques (Decision Table, Random Forest, OneR, Randomizable Filtered Classifier, Logistic model tree) and compute their performance based on TP Rate, FP Rate, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, MCC, ROC Area, PRC Area, and Accuracy (\%). For evaluation purposes, We have used an R language library called latent semantic analysis for creating semantics, and the Weka tool is used for measuring the performance of algorithms. Results show that the random forest depicts the highest accuracy which is 99.3\% due to its parametric function evaluation and less misclassification error.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Under emerging social media technology, mobile learners' behavior analysis and legality education have important practical significance. The research aims to detect the mobile learning (M-learning) learners' behavior in legality education under the background of the Internet era and improve the learning and teaching effect of online legality education and law popularization.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This paper proposes a model based on deep learning (DL) fuzzy clustering analysis (FCA), and bidirectional encoder and decoder (ENDEC) of converter model to detect the mobile learners' behaviors in online legality education under the current social media. Then, the effectiveness of the proposed model is tested. The proposed model expects to be applied to multimedia teaching and law popularization activities and provides some theoretical reference and practical value for improving the effectiveness of online teaching.
            
            
              Findings
              The experimental results show that in the learner behavior detection process of M-learning-oriented online legality education, the model's accuracy can reach 99.8\%. The response time is shorter than other algorithms. Overall, the application effect of the proposed model and algorithm is good and can be applied in practice.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              The research results may lack universality due to the selected research methods. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed methods further. In the future, it is necessary to expand the type and scale of text data to improve the accuracy of data detection.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The research results provide a specific theoretical reference and practical significance for improving the learning effect of online M-learning-oriented legality education.

Data Collection Methods. The data used in this research are metadata, especially the title and abstract of a patent document in Indonesia. With the keyword "fertilizer," Patent metadata was processed in the 1945-2017 period.
Data Analysis. The LDA model can provide a reasonable interpretation regarding topic modeling based on text data.
Results and Discussion. The results find that degree of the patent title is better than the abstract of the patent. The LDA approach can adequately separate the topics of fertilizer patent technology so that it does not have multiple interpretations. 
Conclusion. Based on the findings, there are nine essential topics in the development of fertilizer technology. There is a phenomenon of the lack of technology collaboration between IPC technology sections.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this study is to thoroughly review studies that have used blockchain technology in financial services. This study will help provide a holistic framework that would highlight the current state and challenges of the blockchain in the financial services sector.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The objective of this study is to systematically examine and organize the current body of research literature that either quantitatively or qualitatively explored the use of blockchain technology in financial services. The study uses PRISMA-guided systematic review along with bibliometric analysis to achieve the purpose.
            
            
              Findings
              This study contributes to the existing literature by exploring and analyzing systematic studies available on blockchain with special reference to financial services sector. With blockchain based on five principles, namely, computational logic, peer-to-peer transmission, irreversibility of records, distributed database and transparency with pseudonym has immense potential to unleash and transform the financial service industry. With increasing blockchain-based operations of decentralized banking, insurance, trade finance, financial markets and cryptocurrency market, the subject is rapidly growing and seeking considerable contribution from scholars from around the world.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              This study uses systematic literature review approach, which has its own demerits. Like other studies based on Systematic Literature Review, this study also suffers from a certain bias such as sample selection bias, publication bias, data interpretation and the combination of quantitative and qualitative studies in the population. Further, the adoption and resultant benefits of blockchain have not been empirically tested.
            
            
              Practical implications
              This study can help policymakers and institutions in determining their future course of action, as it highlights the state of research in the area of blockchain technology and financial services.
            
            
              Originality/value

@article{tang_research_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Due to its potential impact on business efficiency, automated customer complaint labeling and classification are of great importance for management decision making and business applications. The majority of the current research on automated labeling uses large and well-balanced datasets. However, customer complaint labels are hierarchical in structure, with many labels at the lowest hierarchy level. Relying on lower-level labels leads to small and imbalanced samples, thus rendering the current automatic labeling practices inapplicable to customer complaints. This article proposes an automatic labeling model incorporating the BERT and word2vec methods. The model is validated on electric utility customer complaint data. Within the model, the BERT method serves to obtain shallow text tags. Furthermore, text enhancement is used to mitigate the problem of imbalanced samples that emerge when the number of labels is large. Finally, the word2vec model is utilized for deep text analysis. Experiments demonstrate the proposed model's efficiency in automating customer complaint labeling. Consequently, the proposed model supports enterprises in improving their service quality while simultaneously reducing labor costs.},

@article{wang_effect_2020,
	abstract = {With more and more investors exerting their voices through network forums or social media platforms, the relationships between online investor sentiment and stock movements have drawn more and more attention. In this paper, we crawl stock comments from China's most popular online stock forum, East Money (www.eastmoney.com), and then develop a sentiment classifier using the LSTM method. Using the online investor sentiment of the stock forum, we explore the effect of online investor sentiment on the stock movements of CSI300. The results show that online investor sentiment has a significant positive impact on both stock return and trading volume and remains significant after controlling book-to-market ratio, BETA, and market value. Moreover, investor sentiment has a significant positive impact on order imbalance of big trade, which represents the main flow of money in the market. As a result, investor sentiment has a positive impact on the major fund flows in the market. In other words, an increase in investor sentiment can boost the major money flows in the market to some extent. From a practical point of view, investor sentiment can assist investors to make investment decisions and help the government to regulate the stock market.},

These  research  papers are  very valuable   for   future  research  and  investigations.   These research  papers  act  as  a  source  for  future  innovations. Researchers    write    review    papers    to    give    updated knowledge about the specific field. But review papers used a limited number of  papers and involved  manually reading each  paper.  Due  to  the  large  volume  of  research  papers published each day, it is not possible for the researchers to go  through  each  paper  to  find  the  updated  knowledge about  their  field  of  interest.  To  automate  the  literature analysis  process  different  techniques  of  text  mining  were used.   This   paper   provides   a   review   of   text   mining techniques   used   in   automatic   literature   analysis.   We collected  papers  in  which  previous  literature  is  used  with text  mining  techniques  to  get  valuable  knowledge.  This review   paper   presented   an   overview   of   text   mining techniques,  their  evaluation criteria,  their  limitations  and challenges for exploring literature to find research trends.},

The large number of data files on the storage media often makes the user unaware of the duplication and redundancy of the files that have an impact on the waste of storage media space, affecting the speed of a computer in the indexing process, finding or backing up data. This study employ the Latent Semantic Analysis method to detect file duplication and analyze the metadata of various file types in storage media. The findings showed that Latent Semantic Analysis method is able to detect duplicate file metadata in various types of storage media thereby further increasing the usability and speed of access of the data storage media.},
