	abstract = {Topic models are widely used in natural language processing, allowing researchers to estimate the underlying themes in a collection of documents. Most topic models require the additional step of attaching meaningful labels to estimated topics, a process that is not scalable, suffers from human bias, and is difficult to replicate. We present a transfer topic labeling method that seeks to remedy these problems, using domain-specific codebooks as the knowledge base to automatically label estimated topics. We demonstrate our approach with a large-scale topic model analysis of the complete corpus of UK House of Commons speeches from 1935 to 2014, using the coding instructions of the Comparative Agendas Project to label topics. We evaluated our results using human expert coding and compared our approach with more current state-of-the-art neural methods. Our approach was simple to implement, compared favorably to expert judgments, and outperformed the neural networks model for a majority of the topics we estimated.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Entities play an essential role in understanding textual documents, regardless of whether the documents are short, such as tweets, or long, such as news articles. In short textual documents, all entities mentioned are usually considered equally important because of the limited amount of information. In long textual documents, however, not all entities are equally important: some are salient and others are not. Traditional entity topic models (ETMs) focus on ways to incorporate entity information into topic models to better explain the generative process of documents. However, entities are usually treated equally, without considering whether they are salient or not. In this work, we propose a novel ETM, Salient Entity Topic Model, to take salient entities into consideration in the document generation process. In particular, we model salient entities as a source of topics used to generate words in documents, in addition to the topic distribution of documents used in traditional topic models. Qualitative and quantitative analysis is performed on the proposed model. Application to entity salience detection demonstrates the effectiveness of our model compared to the state-of-the-art topic model baselines.},
