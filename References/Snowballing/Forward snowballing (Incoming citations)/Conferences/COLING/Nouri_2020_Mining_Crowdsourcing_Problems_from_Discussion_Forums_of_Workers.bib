	abstract = {This article-based doctoral thesis explores the stakeholder perspectives and experiences of crowdsourced creative work on two of the leading crowdsourcing platforms. The thesis has two parts. In the first part, we explore creative work from the perspective of the crowd worker. In the second part, we explore and study the requester's perspective in different contexts and several case studies. The research is exploratory and we contribute empirical insights using survey-based and artefact-based approaches common in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In the former approach, we explore the key issues that may limit creative work on paid crowdsourcing platforms. In the latter approach, we create computational artefacts to elicit authentic experiences from both crowd workers and requesters of crowdsourced creative work. The thesis contributes a classification of crowd workers into five archetypal profiles, based on the crowd workers' demographics, disposition, and preferences for creative work. We propose a three-part classification of creative work on crowdsourcing platforms: creative tasks, creativity tests, and creativity judgements (also referred to as creative feedback). The thesis further investigates the emerging research topic of how requesters can be supported in interpreting and evaluating complex creative work. Last, we discuss the design implications for research and practice and contribute a vision of creative work on future crowdsourcing platforms with the aim of empowering crowd workers and fostering an ecosystem around tailored platforms for creative microwork. Keywords: creative work, creativity, creativity support tools, crowdsourcing},
