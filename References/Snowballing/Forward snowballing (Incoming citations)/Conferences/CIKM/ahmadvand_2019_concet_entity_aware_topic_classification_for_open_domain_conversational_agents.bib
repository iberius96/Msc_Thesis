	abstract = {The SUM'20 workshop was held at the 13th ACM International WSDM Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM 2020) in Houston, Texas. The purpose of the workshop was to stimulate the research community to explore open challenges in building systems that can capture the user's state, context and goals, as well as effectively use these for leveraging intelligent user-centric systems in a wide range of applications. The workshop incorporated different plenary sessions and contributed talks. The workshop website and proceedings are available at https://www.k4all.org/event/wsdmsum20.},
