	abstract = {Topic taxonomies display hierarchical topic structures of a text corpus and provide topical knowledge to enhance various NLP applications. To dynamically incorporate new topic information, several recent studies have tried to expand (or complete) a topic taxonomy by inserting emerging topics identified in a set of new documents. However, existing methods focus only on frequent terms in documents and the local topic-subtopic relations in a taxonomy, which leads to limited topic term coverage and fails to model the global topic hierarchy. In this work, we propose a novel framework for topic taxonomy expansion, named TopicExpan, which directly generates topic-related terms belonging to new topics. Specifically, TopicExpan leverages the hierarchical relation structure surrounding a new topic and the textual content of an input document for topic term generation. This approach encourages newly-inserted topics to further cover important but less frequent terms as well as to keep their relation consistency within the taxonomy. Experimental results on two real-world text corpora show that TopicExpan significantly outperforms other baseline methods in terms of the quality of output taxonomies.},

	abstract = {The online event discovery in social media based documents is useful, such as for disaster recognition and intervention. However, the diverse events incrementally identified from social media streams remain accumulated, ad hoc, and unstructured. They cannot assist users in digesting the tremendous amount of information and finding their interested events. Further, most of the existing work is challenged by jointly identifying incremental events and dynamically organizing them in an adaptive hierarchy. To address these problems, this article proposes

              odeling (dhCM) for social media stream. Instead of manually dividing the timeframe, a multimodal event miner exploits a density estimation technique to continuously capture the temporal influence between documents and incrementally identify online events in textual, temporal, and spatial spaces. At the same time, an adaptive categorization hierarchy is formed to automatically organize the documents into proper categories at multiple levels of granularities. In a nonparametric manner, dhCM accommodates the increasing complexity of data streams with automatically growing the categorization hierarchy over adaptive growth. A sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is used for the online inference of the dhCM parameters. Extensive experiments show that dhCM outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of term coherence, category abstraction and specialization, hierarchical affinity, and event categorization and discovery accuracy.},

              multi-profiled cross-communities
              constructed from users sharing commonalities that include adaptive social profile ingredients (i.e., natural adaptation to certain social traits). The most important types of such cross-communities are the
              densest
              holonic ones, because they exhibit many interesting properties. For example, such a cross-community can represent a portion of users, who share
              all
              the following traits: ethnicity, religion, neighbourhood, and age-range. The denser a multi-profiled cross-community is, the more granular and holonic it is and the greater the number of its members, whose interests are exhibited in the common interests of the entire cross-community. Moreover, the denser a cross-community is, the more specific and distinguishable its interests are (e.g., more distinguishable from other cross-communities). Unfortunately, methods that advocate the detection of granular multi-profiled cross-communities have been under-researched. Most current methods detect multi-profiled communities without consideration to their granularities. To overcome this, we introduce in this paper a novel methodology for detecting the smallest and most granular multi-profiled cross-community, to which an active user belongs. The methodology is implemented in a system called ID\_CC. To improve the accuracy of detecting such cross-communities, we first uncover missing links in social networks. It is imperative for uncovering such missing links because they may contain valuable information (social characteristics commonalities, cross-memberships, etc.). We evaluated ID\_CC by comparing it experimentally with eight methods. The results of the experiments revealed marked improvement.},

	abstract = {Ontology plays a critical role in knowledge engineering and knowledge graphs (KGs). However, building ontology is still a nontrivial task. Ontology learning aims at generating domain ontologies from various kinds of resources by natural language processing and machine learning techniques. One major challenge of ontology learning is reducing labeling work for new domains. This paper proposes an ontology learning method based on transfer learning, namely TF-Mnt, which aims at learning knowledge from new domains that have limited labeled data. This paper selects Web data as the learning source and defines various features, which utilizes abundant textual information and heterogeneous semi-structured information. Then, a new transfer learning model TF-Mnt is proposed, and the parameters’ estimation is also addressed. Although there exist distribution differences of features between two domains, TF-Mnt can measure the relevance by calculating the correlation coefficient. Moreover, TF-Mnt can efficiently transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain and avoid negative transfer. Experiments in real-world datasets show that TF-Mnt achieves promising learning performance for new domains despite the small number of labels in it, by learning knowledge from a proper existing domain which can be automatically selected.},
