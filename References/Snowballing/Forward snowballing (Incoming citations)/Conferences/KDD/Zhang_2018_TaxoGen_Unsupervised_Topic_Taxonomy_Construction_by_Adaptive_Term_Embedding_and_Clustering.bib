@article{lee_topic_2022,
	abstract = {Topic taxonomies display hierarchical topic structures of a text corpus and provide topical knowledge to enhance various NLP applications. To dynamically incorporate new topic information, several recent studies have tried to expand (or complete) a topic taxonomy by inserting emerging topics identified in a set of new documents. However, existing methods focus only on frequent terms in documents and the local topic-subtopic relations in a taxonomy, which leads to limited topic term coverage and fails to model the global topic hierarchy. In this work, we propose a novel framework for topic taxonomy expansion, named TopicExpan, which directly generates topic-related terms belonging to new topics. Specifically, TopicExpan leverages the hierarchical relation structure surrounding a new topic and the textual content of an input document for topic term generation. This approach encourages newly-inserted topics to further cover important but less frequent terms as well as to keep their relation consistency within the taxonomy. Experimental results on two real-world text corpora show that TopicExpan significantly outperforms other baseline methods in terms of the quality of output taxonomies.},

@article{lacasta_approaches_2022,
	abstract = {The discrete representation of resources in geospatial catalogues affects their information retrieval performance. The performance could be improved by using automatically generated clusters of related resources, which we name quasi-spatial dataset series. This work evaluates whether a clustering process can create quasi-spatial dataset series using only textual information from metadata elements. We assess the combination of different kinds of text cleaning approaches, word and sentence-embeddings representations (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, ELMo, Sentence BERT, and Universal Sentence Encoder), and clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN, OPTICS, and agglomerative clustering) for the task. The results demonstrate that combining word-embeddings representations with an agglomerative-based clustering creates better quasi-spatial dataset series than the other approaches. In addition, we have found that the ELMo representation with agglomerative clustering produces good results without any preprocessing step for text cleaning.},

@article{guo_dhcm_2021,
	abstract = {The online event discovery in social media based documents is useful, such as for disaster recognition and intervention. However, the diverse events incrementally identified from social media streams remain accumulated, ad hoc, and unstructured. They cannot assist users in digesting the tremendous amount of information and finding their interested events. Further, most of the existing work is challenged by jointly identifying incremental events and dynamically organizing them in an adaptive hierarchy. To address these problems, this article proposes

              odeling (dhCM) for social media stream. Instead of manually dividing the timeframe, a multimodal event miner exploits a density estimation technique to continuously capture the temporal influence between documents and incrementally identify online events in textual, temporal, and spatial spaces. At the same time, an adaptive categorization hierarchy is formed to automatically organize the documents into proper categories at multiple levels of granularities. In a nonparametric manner, dhCM accommodates the increasing complexity of data streams with automatically growing the categorization hierarchy over adaptive growth. A sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is used for the online inference of the dhCM parameters. Extensive experiments show that dhCM outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of term coherence, category abstraction and specialization, hierarchical affinity, and event categorization and discovery accuracy.},

@article{bonnici_covid19it_2022,
	abstract = {The Covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted on our lives, triggering a strong reaction resulting in vaccines, more effective diagnoses and therapies, policies to contain the pandemic outbreak, to name but a few. A significant contribution to their success comes from the computer science and information technology communities, both in support to other disciplines and as the primary driver of solutions for, e.g., diagnostics, social distancing, and contact tracing. In this work, we surveyed the Italian computer science and engineering community initiatives against the Covid19 pandemic. The 128 responses thus collected document the response of such a community during the first pandemic wave in Italy (February-May 2020), through several initiatives carried out by both single researchers and research groups able to promptly react to Covid19, even remotely. The data obtained by the survey are here reported, discussed and further investigated by Natural Language Processing techniques, to generate semantic clusters based on embedding representations of the surveyed activity descriptions. The resulting clusters have been then used to extend an existing Covid19 taxonomy with the classification of related research activities in computer science and information technology areas, summarizing this work contribution through a reproducible survey-to-taxonomy methodology.},

@article{addanki_how_2021,
	abstract = {Metric based comparison operations such as finding maximum, nearest and farthest neighbor are fundamental to studying various clustering techniques such as
              k
              -center clustering and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. These techniques crucially rely on accurate estimation of pairwise distance between records. However, computing exact features of the records, and their pairwise distances is often challenging, and sometimes not possible. We circumvent this challenge by leveraging weak supervision in the form of a comparison oracle that compares the relative distance between the queried points such as `Is point
              u
              closer to
              v
              or
              w
              closer to
              x
              ?'.
            
            
              However, it is possible that some queries are easier to answer than others using a comparison oracle. We capture this by introducing two different noise models called adversarial and probabilistic noise. In this paper, we study various problems that include finding maximum, nearest/farthest neighbor search under these noise models. Building upon the techniques we develop for these problems, we give robust algorithms for
              k
              -center clustering and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We prove that our algorithms achieve good approximation guarantees with a high probability and analyze their query complexity. We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques empirically on various real-world datasets.},

	abstract = {The paper extends earlier work on modeling hierarchically polarized groups on social media. An algorithm is described that 1) detects points of
              agreement
              and
              disagreement
              between groups, and 2) divides them
              hierarchically
              to represent nested patterns of agreement and disagreement given a structural guide. For example, two opposing parties might disagree on core issues. Moreover, within a party, despite agreement on fundamentals, disagreement might occur on further details. We call such scenarios
              hierarchically polarized groups
              . An (enhanced) unsupervised Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm is described for computational modeling of hierarchically polarized groups. It is enhanced with a language model, and with a proof of orthogonality of factorized components. We evaluate it on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating ability to hierarchically decompose overlapping beliefs. In the case where polarization is flat, we compare it to prior art and show that it outperforms state of the art approaches for polarization detection and stance separation. An ablation study further illustrates the value of individual components, including new enhancements.},

	abstract = {Research on the construction of traditional information science methodology taxonomy is mostly conducted manually. From the limited corpus, researchers have attempted to summarize some of the research methodology entities into several abstract levels (generally three levels); however, they have been unable to provide a more granular hierarchy. Moreover, updating the methodology taxonomy is traditionally a slow process. In this study, we collected full-text academic papers related to information science. First, we constructed a basic methodology taxonomy with three levels by manual annotation. Then, the word vectors of the research methodology entities were trained using the full-text data. Accordingly, the research methodology entities were clustered and the basic methodology taxonomy was expanded using the clustering results to obtain a methodology taxonomy with more levels. This study provides new concepts for constructing a methodology taxonomy of information science. The proposed methodology taxonomy is semi-automated; it is more detailed than conventional schemes and the speed of taxonomy renewal has been enhanced.},

	abstract = {Network representation learning aims at transferring node proximity in networks into distributed vectors, which can be leveraged in various downstream applications. Recent research has shown that nodes in a network can often be organized in latent hierarchical structures, but without a particular underlying taxonomy, the learned node embedding is less useful nor interpretable. In this work, we aim to improve network embedding by modeling the conditional node proximity in networks indicated by node labels residing in real taxonomies. In the meantime, we also aim to model the hierarchical label proximity in the given taxonomies, which is too coarse by solely looking at the hierarchical topologies. Comprehensive experiments and case studies demonstrate the utility of TAXOGAN.},
