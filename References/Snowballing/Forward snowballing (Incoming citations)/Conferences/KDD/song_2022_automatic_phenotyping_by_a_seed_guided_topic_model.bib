              The rapid growth of electronic health record (EHR) datasets opens up promising opportunities to understand human diseases in a systematic way. However, effective extraction of clinical knowledge from EHR data has been hindered by the sparse and noisy information. We present Graph ATtention-Embedded Topic Model (GAT-ETM), an end-to-end taxonomy-knowledge-graph-based multimodal embedded topic model. GAT-ETM distills latent disease topics from EHR data by learning the embedding from a constructed medical knowledge graph. We applied GAT-ETM to a large-scale EHR dataset consisting of over 1 million patients. We evaluated its performance based on topic quality, drug imputation, and disease diagnosis prediction. GAT-ETM demonstrated superior performance over the alternative methods on all tasks. Moreover, GAT-ETM learned clinically meaningful graph-informed embedding of the EHR codes and discovered interpretable and accurate patient representations for patient stratification and drug recommendations. GAT-ETM code is available at
