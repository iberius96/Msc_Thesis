	abstract = {Despite tremendous progress in automatic summarization, state-of-the-art methods are predominantly trained to excel in summarizing short newswire articles, or documents with strong layout biases such as scientific articles or government reports. Efficient techniques to summarize financial documents, including facts and figures, have largely been unexplored, majorly due to the unavailability of suitable datasets. In this work, we present ECTSum, a new dataset with transcripts of earnings calls (ECTs), hosted by publicly traded companies, as documents, and short experts-written telegram-style bullet point summaries derived from corresponding Reuters articles. ECTs are long unstructured documents without any prescribed length limit or format. We benchmark our dataset with state-of-the-art summarizers across various metrics evaluating the content quality and factual consistency of the generated summaries. Finally, we present a simple-yet-effective approach, ECT-BPS, to generate a set of bullet points that precisely capture the important facts discussed in the calls.},

	abstract = {Citation count prediction is an important task for estimating the future impact of research papers. Most of the existing works utilize the information extracted from the paper itself. In this article, we focus on how to utilize another kind of useful data signal (i.e., peer review text) to improve both the performance and interpretability of the prediction models.
            Specially, we propose a novel aspect-aware capsule network for citation count prediction based on review text. It contains two major capsule layers, namely the feature capsule layer and the aspect capsule layer, with two different routing approaches, respectively. Feature capsules encode the local semantics from review sentences as the input of aspect capsule layer, whereas aspect capsules aim to capture high-level semantic features that will be served as final representations for prediction. Besides the predictive capacity, we also enhance the model interpretability with two strategies. First, we use the topic distribution of the review text to guide the learning of aspect capsules so that each aspect capsule can represent a specific aspect in the review. Then, we use the learned aspect capsules to generate readable text for explaining the predicted citation count. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model in both performance and interpretability.},

	abstract = {Opinion mining and summarization of the increasing user-generated content on different digital platforms (e.g., news platforms) are playing significant roles in the success of government programs and initiatives in digital governance, from extracting and analyzing citizen’s sentiments for decision-making. Opinion mining provides the sentiment from contents, whereas summarization aims to condense the most relevant information. However, most of the reported opinion summarization methods are conceived to obtain generic summaries, and the context that originates the opinions (e.g., the news) has not usually been considered. In this paper, we present a context-aware opinion summarization model for monitoring the generated opinions from news. In this approach, the topic modeling and the news content are combined to determine the “importance” of opinionated sentences. The effectiveness of different developed settings of our model was evaluated through several experiments carried out over Spanish news and opinions collected from a real news platform. The obtained results show that our model can generate opinion summaries focused on essential aspects of the news, as well as cover the main topics in the opinionated texts well. The integration of term clustering, word embeddings, and the similarity-based sentence-to-news scoring turned out the more promising and effective setting of our model.},
