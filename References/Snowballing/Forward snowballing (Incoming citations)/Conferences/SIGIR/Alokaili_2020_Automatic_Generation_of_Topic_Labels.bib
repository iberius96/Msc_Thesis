@inproceedings{wood_2022_a_bayesian_topic_model_for_human_evaluated_interpretability,
	abstract = {One desiderata of topic modeling is to produce interpretable topics. Given a cluster of document-tokens comprising a topic, we can order the topic by counting each word. It is natural to think that each topic could easily be labeled by looking at the words with the highest word count. However, this is not always the case. A human evaluator can often have difficulty identifying a single label that accurately describes the topic as many top words seem unrelated. This paper aims to improve interpretability in topic modeling by providing a novel, outperforming interpretable topic model Our approach combines two previously established subdomains in topic modeling: nonparametric and weakly-supervised topic models. Given a nonparametric topic model, we can include weakly-supervised input using novel modifications to the nonparametric generative model. These modifications lay the groundwork for a compelling setting{---}one in which most corpora, without any previous supervised or weakly-supervised input, can discover interpretable topics. This setting also presents various challenging sub-problems of which we provide resolutions. Combining nonparametric topic models with weakly-supervised topic models leads to an exciting discovery{---}a complete, self-contained and outperforming topic model for interpretability.},

@article{lin_2022_automatic_scene_based_topic_channel_construction_system_for_e_commerce,
	abstract = {Scene marketing that well demonstrates user interests within a certain scenario has proved effective for offline shopping. To conduct scene marketing for e-commerce platforms, this work presents a novel product form, scene-based topic channel which typically consists of a list of diverse products belonging to the same usage scenario and a topic title that describes the scenario with marketing words. As manual construction of channels is time-consuming due to billions of products as well as dynamic and diverse customers' interests, it is necessary to leverage AI techniques to automatically construct channels for certain usage scenarios and even discover novel topics. To be specific, we first frame the channel construction task as a two-step problem, i.e., scene-based topic generation and product clustering, and propose an E-commerce Scene-based Topic Channel construction system (i.e., ESTC) to achieve automated production, consisting of scene-based topic generation model for the e-commerce domain, product clustering on the basis of topic similarity, as well as quality control based on automatic model filtering and human screening. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B test validates the effectiveness of such a novel product form as well as the proposed system. In addition, we also introduce the experience of deploying the proposed system on a real-world e-commerce recommendation platform.},

@article{rosati_2022_moving_beyond_word_lists_towards_abstractive_topic_labels_for_human_like_topics_of_scientific_documents,
	abstract = {Topic models represent groups of documents as a list of words (the topic labels). This work asks whether an alternative approach to topic labeling can be developed that is closer to a natural language description of a topic than a word list. To this end, we present an approach to generating human-like topic labels using abstractive multi-document summarization (MDS). We investigate our approach with an exploratory case study. We model topics in citation sentences in order to understand what further research needs to be done to fully operationalize MDS for topic labeling. Our case study shows that in addition to more human-like topics there are additional advantages to evaluation by using clustering and summarization measures instead of topic model measures. However, we find that there are several developments needed before we can design a well-powered study to evaluate MDS for topic modeling fully. Namely, improving cluster cohesion, improving the factuality and faithfulness of MDS, and increasing the number of documents that might be supported by MDS. We present a number of ideas on how these can be tackled and conclude with some thoughts on how topic modeling can also be used to improve MDS in general.},

@article{tzitzikas_2022_cidoc_crm_and_machine_learning_a_survey_and_future_research,
	abstract = {The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC-CRM) is an ISO Standard ontology for the cultural domain that is used for enabling semantic interoperability between museums, libraries, archives and other cultural institutions. For leveraging CIDOC-CRM, several processes and tasks have to be carried out. It is therefore important to investigate to what extent we can automate these processes in order to facilitate interoperability. For this reason, in this paper, we describe the related tasks, and we survey recent works that apply machine learning (ML) techniques for reducing the costs related to CIDOC-CRM-based compliance and interoperability. In particular, we (a) analyze the main processes and tasks, (b) identify tasks where the recent advances of ML (including Deep Learning) would be beneficial, (c) identify cases where ML has been applied (and the results are successful/promising) and (d) suggest tasks that can benefit from applying ML. Finally, since the approaches that leverage both CIDOC-CRM data and ML are few in number, (e) we introduce our vision for the given topic, and (f) we provide a list of open CIDOC-CRM datasets that can be potentially used for ML tasks.},

@article{wahid_2021_topic2features_a_novel_framework_to_classify_noisy_and_sparse_textual_data_using_lda_topic_distributions,
	abstract = {In supervised machine learning, specifically in classification tasks, selecting and analyzing the feature vector to achieve better results is one of the most important tasks. Traditional methods such as comparing the features' cosine similarity and exploring the datasets manually to check which feature vector is suitable is relatively time consuming. Many classification tasks failed to achieve better classification results because of poor feature vector selection and sparseness of data. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework, topic2features (T2F), to deal with short and sparse data using the topic distributions of hidden topics gathered from dataset and converting into feature vectors to build supervised classifier. For this we leveraged the unsupervised topic modelling LDA (latent dirichlet allocation) approach to retrieve the topic distributions employed in supervised learning algorithms. We made use of labelled data and topic distributions of hidden topics that were generated from that data. We explored how the representation based on topics affect the classification performance by applying supervised classification algorithms. Additionally, we did careful evaluation on two types of datasets and compared them with baseline approaches without topic distributions and other comparable methods. The results show that our framework performs significantly better in terms of classification performance compared to the baseline(without T2F) approaches and also yields improvement in terms of F1 score compared to other compared approaches.},
