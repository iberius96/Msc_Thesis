	abstract = {In this paper, we compare the performances of traditional machine learning models using feature engineering and word vectors and the state-of-the-art language model BERT using word embeddings on three datasets. We also consider the time and cost efficiency of feature engineering compared to BERT. From our results we conclude that the use of the BERT model was only worth the time and cost trade-off for one of the three datasets we used for comparison, where the BERT model significantly outperformed any kind of traditional classifier that uses feature vectors, instead of embeddings. Using the BERT model for the other datasets only achieved an increase of 0.03 and 0.05 of accuracy and F1 score respectively, which could be argued makes its use not worth the time and cost of GPU.},

	abstract = {How do climate change deniers differ from believers? Is there any correlation between human sentiment and deviations from historic temperature? We answer nine such questions using 13 years of Twitter data and 15 million tweets. Seven aspects are explored, namely, user gender, climate change stance and sentiment, aggressiveness, deviations from historic temperature, topics discussed, and environmental disaster events. We found that: a) climate change deniers use the term global warming much often than believers and use aggressive language, while believers tweet more about taking actions to fight the phenomenon, b) deniers are more present in the American Region, South Africa, Japan, and Eastern China and less present in Europe, India, and Central Africa, c) people connect much more the warm temperatures with man-made climate change than cold temperatures, d) the same regions that had more climate change deniers also tweet with negative sentiment, e) a positive correlation is observed between human sentiment and deviations from historic temperature; when the deviation is between −1.143°
              C
              and +2.401°
              C
              , people tweet the most positive, f) there exist 90\% correlation between sentiment and stance, and -94\% correlation between sentiment and aggressiveness, g) no clear patterns are observed to correlate sentiment and stance with disaster events based on total deaths, number of affected, and damage costs, h) topics discussed on Twitter indicate that climate change is a politicized issue and people are expressing their concerns especially when witnessing extreme weather; the global stance could be considered optimistic, as there are many discussions that point out the importance of human intervention to fight climate change and actions are being taken through events to raise the awareness of this phenomenon.},

	abstract = {The exoskeleton technology has been rapidly advancing in the recent past due to its multitude of applications and diverse use cases in assisted living, military, healthcare, firefighting, and industry 4.0. The exoskeleton market is projected to increase by multiple times its current value within the next two years. Therefore, it is crucial to study the degree and trends of user interest, views, opinions, perspectives, attitudes, acceptance, feedback, engagement, buying behavior, and satisfaction, towards exoskeletons, for which the availability of Big Data of conversations about exoskeletons is necessary. The Internet of Everything style of today’s living, characterized by people spending more time on the internet than ever before, with a specific focus on social media platforms, holds the potential for the development of such a dataset by the mining of relevant social media conversations. Twitter, one such social media platform, is highly popular amongst all age groups, where the topics found in the conversation paradigms include emerging technologies such as exoskeletons. To address this research challenge, this work makes two scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents an open-access dataset of about 140,000 Tweets about exoskeletons that were posted in a 5-year period from 21 May 2017 to 21 May 2022. Second, based on a comprehensive review of the recent works in the fields of Big Data, Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, Data Mining, Pattern Recognition, and Artificial Intelligence that may be applied to relevant Twitter data for advancing research, innovation, and discovery in the field of exoskeleton research, a total of 100 Research Questions are presented for researchers to study, analyze, evaluate, ideate, and investigate based on this dataset.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the findings of an exploratory study on the continuously generating Big Data on Twitter related to the sharing of information, news, views, opinions, ideas, knowledge, feedback, and experiences about the COVID-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on the Omicron variant, which is the globally dominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 at this time. A total of 12028 tweets about the Omicron variant were studied, and the specific characteristics of tweets that were analyzed include - sentiment, language, source, type, and embedded URLs. The findings of this study are manifold. First, from sentiment analysis, it was observed that 50.5\% of tweets had the \&lsquo;neutral\&rsquo; emotion. The other emotions - \&lsquo;bad\&rsquo;, \&lsquo;good\&rsquo;, \&lsquo;terrible\&rsquo;, and \&lsquo;great\&rsquo; were found in 15.6\%, 14.0\%, 12.5\%, and 7.5\% of the tweets, respectively. Second, the findings of language interpretation showed that 65.9\% of the tweets were posted in English. It was followed by Spanish or Castillian, French, Italian, Japanese, and other languages, which were found in 10.5\%, 5.1\%, 3.3\%, 2.5\%, and \&amp;lt;2\% of the tweets, respectively. Third, the findings from source tracking showed that \&ldquo;Twitter for Android\&rdquo; was associated with 35.2\% of tweets. It was followed by \&ldquo;Twitter Web App\&rdquo;, \&ldquo;Twitter for iPhone\&rdquo;, \&ldquo;Twitter for iPad\&rdquo;, \&ldquo;TweetDeck\&rdquo;, and all other sources that accounted for 29.2\%, 25.8\%, 3.8\%, 1.6\%, and \&amp;lt;1\% of the tweets, respectively. Fourth, studying the type of tweets revealed that retweets accounted for 60.8\% of the tweets, it was followed by original tweets and replies that accounted for 19.8\% and 19.4\% of the tweets, respectively. Finally, in terms of embedded URL analysis, the most common URLs embedded in the tweets were found to be twitter.com, which was followed by biorxiv.org, nature.com, wapo.st, nzherald.co.nz, recvprofits.com, science.org, and other URLs.},
