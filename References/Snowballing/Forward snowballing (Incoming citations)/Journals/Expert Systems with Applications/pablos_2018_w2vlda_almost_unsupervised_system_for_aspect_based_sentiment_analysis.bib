@techreport{dehler_holland_2021_the_legitimacy_of_wind_power_in_germany,
	abstract = {Legitimacy is a crucial factor determining the success of technologies in the early stages of development and for maintaining resource flows as well as public and political support across the technology life cycle. In sustainability transitions that unfold over long periods of time, the maintenance of legitimacy of technologies identified as vital for sustainability becomes a key challenge. In the energy sector, wind power contributes to the transition to an energy system with low greenhouse gas emissions. In Germany, wind power recently faced a series of lawsuits and decreasing investment activity. Therefore, we assess the legitimacy of wind power in Germany by analyzing newspaper articles from four national newspapers from 2009 to 2018. A large amount of articles motivates the use of topic models and statistical methods to shed light on the changing alignment of wind power with its context. The results show that various issues temporarily gain prominence on the agenda. Lately, the legitimacy of wind power in Germany is increasingly challenged by adverse effects on humans, animals, and landscapes. Policymakers and project developers may address aspects of pragmatic legitimacy, such as civic participation and the local distribution of profits.},

@article{al_tameemi_2022_a_comprehensive_review_of_visual_textual_sentiment_analysis_from_social_media_networks,
	abstract = {Social media networks have become a significant aspect of people's lives, serving as a platform for their ideas, opinions and emotions. Consequently, automated sentiment analysis (SA) is critical for recognising people's feelings in ways that other information sources cannot. The analysis of these feelings revealed various applications, including brand evaluations, YouTube film reviews and healthcare applications. As social media continues to develop, people post a massive amount of information in different forms, including text, photos, audio and video. Thus, traditional SA algorithms have become limited, as they do not consider the expressiveness of other modalities. By including such characteristics from various material sources, these multimodal data streams provide new opportunities for optimising the expected results beyond text-based SA. Our study focuses on the forefront field of multimodal SA, which examines visual and textual data posted on social media networks. Many people are more likely to utilise this information to express themselves on these platforms. To serve as a resource for academics in this rapidly growing field, we introduce a comprehensive overview of textual and visual SA, including data pre-processing, feature extraction techniques, sentiment benchmark datasets, and the efficacy of multiple classification methodologies suited to each field. We also provide a brief introduction of the most frequently utilised data fusion strategies and a summary of existing research on visual-textual SA. Finally, we highlight the most significant challenges and investigate several important sentiment applications.},

@article{mera_gaona_2021_framework_for_the_ensemble_of_feature_selection_methods,
	abstract = {Feature selection (FS) has attracted the attention of many researchers in the last few years due to the increasing sizes of datasets, which contain hundreds or thousands of columns (features). Typically, not all columns represent relevant values. Consequently, the noise or irrelevant columns could confuse the algorithms, leading to a weak performance of machine learning models. Different FS algorithms have been proposed to analyze highly dimensional datasets and determine their subsets of relevant features to overcome this problem. However, very often, FS algorithms are biased by the data. Thus, methods for ensemble feature selection (EFS) algorithms have become an alternative to integrate the advantages of single FS algorithms and compensate for their disadvantages. The objective of this research is to propose a conceptual and implementation framework to understand the main concepts and relationships in the process of aggregating FS algorithms and to demonstrate how to address FS on datasets with high dimensionality. The proposed conceptual framework is validated by deriving an implementation framework, which incorporates a set of Phyton packages with functionalities to support the assembly of feature selection algorithms. The performance of the implementation framework was demonstrated in several experiments discovering relevant features in the Sonar, SPECTF, and WDBC datasets. The experiments contrasted the accuracy of two machine learning classifiers (decision tree and logistic regression), trained with subsets of features generated either by single FS algorithms or the set of features selected by the ensemble feature selection framework. We observed that for the three datasets used (Sonar, SPECTF, and WD), the highest precision percentages (86.95\%, 74.73\%, and 93.85\%, respectively) were obtained when the classifiers were trained with the subset of features generated by our framework. Additionally, the stability of the feature sets generated using our ensemble method was evaluated. The results showed that the method achieved perfect stability for the three datasets used in the evaluation.},

	abstract = {Data analysis becomes difficult with the increase of large amounts of data. More specifically, extracting meaningful insights from this vast amount of data and grouping them based on their shared features without human intervention requires advanced methodologies. There are topic modeling methods to overcome this problem in text analysis for downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and news classification. In this research, we benchmark several classifiers, namely Random Forest, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, using the classical LDA and n-stage LDA topic modeling methods for feature extraction in headlines classification. We run our experiments on 3 and 5 classes publicly available Turkish and English datasets. We demonstrate that n-stage LDA as a feature extractor obtains state-of-the-art performance for any downstream classifier. It should also be noted that Random Forest was the most successful algorithm for both datasets.},

	abstract = {Sentiment classification is one of the hottest research areas among the Natural Language Processing (NLP) topics. While it aims to detect sentiment polarity and classification of the given opinion, requires a large number of aspect extractions. However, extracting aspect takes human effort and long time. To reduce this, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method have come out recently to deal with this issue.In this paper, an efficient preprocessing method for sentiment classification is presented and will be used for analyzing user's comments on Twitter social network. For this purpose, different text preprocessing techniques have been used on the dataset to achieve an acceptable standard text. Latent Dirichlet Allocation has been applied on the obtained data after this fast and accurate preprocessing phase. The implementation of different sentiment analysis methods and the results of these implementations have been compared and evaluated. The experimental results show that the combined uses of the preprocessing method of this paper and Latent Dirichlet Allocation have an acceptable results compared to other basic methods.},

@article{truica_2021_topic_based_document_level_sentiment_analysis_using_contextual_cues,
	abstract = {Document-level Sentiment Analysis is a complex task that implies the analysis of large textual content that can incorporate multiple contradictory polarities at the phrase and word levels. Most of the current approaches either represent textual data using pre-trained word embeddings without considering the local context that can be extracted from the dataset, or they detect the overall topic polarity without considering both the local and global context. In this paper, we propose a novel document-topic embedding model, DocTopic2Vec, for document-level polarity detection in large texts by employing general and specific contextual cues obtained through the use of document embeddings (Doc2Vec) and Topic Modeling. In our approach, (1) we use a large dataset with game reviews to create different word embeddings by applying Word2Vec, FastText, and GloVe, (2) we create Doc2Vecs enriched with the local context given by the word embeddings for each review, (3) we construct topic embeddings Topic2Vec using three Topic Modeling algorithms, i.e., LDA, NMF, and LSI, to enhance the global context of the Sentiment Analysis task, (4) for each document and its dominant topic, we build the new DocTopic2Vec by concatenating the Doc2Vec with the Topic2Vec created with the same word embedding. We also design six new Convolutional-based (Bidirectional) Recurrent Deep Neural Network Architectures that show promising results for this task. The proposed DocTopic2Vecs are used to benchmark multiple Machine and Deep Learning models, i.e., a Logistic Regression model, used as a baseline, and 18 Deep Neural Networks Architectures. The experimental results show that the new embedding and the new Deep Neural Network Architectures achieve better results than the baseline, i.e., Logistic Regression and Doc2Vec.},

@article{dina_2020_aspect_based_sentiment_analysis_of_employees_review_experience,
	abstract = {Background: Employees of technology companies evaluate their experience through online reviews. Online reviews of companies from employees or former employees help job seeker to find out the weaknesses and strengths of the companies.  The reviews can be used as an evaluation tool for each technology company to understand their employee's perceptions. However, most information on online reviews is not well responded since some of the detailed information of the company is missing. Objective: This study aims to generate an Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis using user review data. The review data were then extracted and classified into five aspects: work balance, culture value, career opportunities, company benefit, and management. The output of this study is the aspect score from each company.Methods: This study suggests a method to analyze online reviews from employees in detail, so it can prevent the missing of specific information. The analysis was sequentially carried out in five stages. First, user review data were crawled from Glassdoor and stored in a database. Second, the raw data were processed in the data pre-processing stage to delete the incomplete data. Third, the words other than noun keyword were eliminated using Standford POS Tagger. Fourth, the noun keywords were then classified into each aspect. Finally, the aspect score was calculated based on the aspect-based sentiment analysis.Results: Result showed that the proposed method managed to turn raw review data into five aspects based on user perception.Conclusion: The study provides information for two parties, job seeker and the company. The analysis of the review could help the job seeker to decide which company that suits his need and ability. For the companies, it can be a great assistance because they will be more aware of their strengths and weaknesses. This study could possibly also provide ratings to the companies based on the aspects that have been determined.},

@article{bansal_2020_aspect_context_aware_sentiment_classification_of_online_consumer_reviews,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Aspect based sentiment classification is valuable for providing deeper insight into online consumer reviews (OCR). However, the majority of the previous studies explicitly determine the orientation of aspect related sentiment bearing word and overlook the aspect-context. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an aspect-context aware sentiment classification of OCR for deeper and more accurate insights.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              In the proposed methodology, first, aspect descriptions and sentiment bearing words are extracted. Then, the skip-gram model is used to extract the first set of features to capture contextual information. For the second category of features, cosine similarity is used between a pre-defined seed word list and aspects, to capture aspect context sensitive sentiments. The third set of features includes weighted word vectors using term frequency-inverse document frequency. After concatenating features, ensemble classifier is used using three base classifiers.
            
            
              Findings
              Experimental results on two real-world data sets with variable lengths, acquired from Amazon.com and TripAdvisor.com, show that the advised ensemble approach significantly outperforms sentiment classification accuracy of state-of-the-art and baseline methods.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This method is capable of capturing the correct sentiment of ambiguous words and other special words by extracting aspect-context using word vector similarity instead of expensive lexical resources, and hence, shows superior performance in terms of accuracy as compared to other methods.},

@article{tai_2022_hyperbolic_disentangled_representation_for_fine_grained_aspect_extraction,
	abstract = {Automatic identification of salient aspects from user reviews is especially useful for opinion analysis. There has been significant progress in utilizing weakly supervised approaches, which require only a small set of seed words for training aspect classifiers. However, there is always room for improvement. First, no weakly supervised approaches fully utilize latent hierarchies between words. Second, each seed word's representation should have different latent semantics and be distinct when it represents a different aspect. In this paper we propose HDAE, a hyperbolic disentangled aspect extractor in which a hyperbolic aspect classifier captures words' latent hierarchies, and an aspect-disentangled representation models the distinct latent semantics of each seed word. Compared to previous baselines, HDAE achieves average F1 performance gains of 18.2\% and 24.1\% on Amazon product review and restaurant review datasets, respectively. In addition, the embedding visualization experience demonstrates that HDAE is a more effective approach to leveraging seed words. An ablation study and a case study further attest the effectiveness of the proposed components.},

@article{shi_2021_a_simple_and_effective_self_supervised_contrastive_learning_framework_for_aspect_detection,
	abstract = {Unsupervised aspect detection (UAD) aims at automatically extracting interpretable aspects and identifying aspect-specific segments (such as sentences) from online reviews. However, recent deep learning based topic models, specifically aspect-based autoencoder, suffer from several problems such as extracting noisy aspects and poorly mapping aspects discovered by models to the aspects of interest. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we first propose a self-supervised contrastive learning framework and an attention-based model equipped with a novel smooth self-attention (SSA) module for the UAD task in order to learn better representations for aspects and review segments. Secondly, we introduce a high-resolution selective mapping (HRSMap) method to efficiently assign aspects discovered by the model to the aspects of interest. We also propose using a knowledge distillation technique to further improve the aspect detection performance. Our methods outperform several recent unsupervised and weakly supervised approaches on publicly available benchmark user review datasets. Aspect interpretation results show that extracted aspects are meaningful, have a good coverage, and can be easily mapped to aspects of interest. Ablation studies and attention weight visualization also demonstrate effectiveness of SSA and the knowledge distillation method.},

@article{patel_2022_aspect_category_detection,
	abstract = {The major subtask of Sentiment analysis based on aspects (ABSA) is the category of aspectdetection (ACD). Due to the subjectivity inherent in categorizing, as well as the occurrence of overlapping classes, it is a difficult challenge to solve. Rule-based techniques, as well as other machine learning approaches, have been used to tackle ACD, and a majority of them are statistical behavior. We employed an association rulebased method in this article. We developed a mixed principle strategy that incorporates both association rule mining and semantics associations to address the statistical limitations of association rules. We employed the concept of word-embed for semantic linkages. The experiments were carried out using the SemEval dataset, which is a standardized set of data for categorizing features industry. We discovered how semantic connections could help to enhance classification accuracy by complementing statistical associations. The proposed method outperforms several statistical methods.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this study is to discover the factors affecting customer delight, satisfaction and dissatisfaction in fine dining experiences (FDEs).
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Online user generated 2,585 reviews on TripAdvisor for 46 five-star hotel restaurants operating in Istanbul were analyzed with the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm.
            
            
              Findings
              LDA created nine, eight and seven topics for delight, satisfaction and dissatisfaction, respectively. The most salient topics for customer delight, satisfaction and dissatisfaction in FDEs are staff (17.3\%), view (19\%), and food quality (23\%), respectively.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study is one of the few studies investigating customer delight and satisfaction together. The study shows that FDEs can be analyzed with text mining techniques. Moreover, the study contributes to the literature on customer delight by adding staff topic as an antecedent.},

@article{rintyarna_2019_evaluating_the_performance_of_sentence_level_features_and_domain_sensitive_features_of_product_reviews_on_supervised_sentiment_analysis_tasks,
	abstract = {Abstract
            With the popularity of e-commerce, posting online product reviews expressing customer's sentiment or opinion towards products has grown exponentially. Sentiment analysis is a computational method that plays an essential role in automating the extraction of subjective information i.e. customer's sentiment or opinion from online product reviews. Two approaches commonly used in Sentiment analysis tasks are supervised approaches and lexicon-based approaches. In supervised approaches, Sentiment analysis is seen as a text classification task. The result depends not only on the robustness of the machine learning algorithm but also on the utilized features. Bag-of-word is a common utilized features. As a statistical feature, bag-of-word does not take into account semantic of words. Previous research has indicated the potential of semantic in supervised SA task. To augment the result of sentiment analysis, this paper proposes a method to extract text features named sentence level features (SLF) and domain sensitive features (DSF) which take into account semantic of words in both sentence level and domain level of product reviews. A word sense disambiguation based method was adapted to extract SLF. For every similarity employed in generating SLF, the SentiCircle-based method was enhanced to generate DSF. Results of the experiments indicated that our proposed semantic features i.e. SLF and SLF + DSF favorably increase the performance of supervised sentiment analysis on product reviews.},

@article{yadav_2019_effectiveness_of_domain_based_lexicons_vis_a_vis_general_lexicon_for_aspect_level_sentiment_analysis_a_comparative_analysis,
	abstract = {One can either use machine learning techniques or lexicons to undertake sentiment analysis. Machine learning techniques include text classification algorithms like SVM, naive Bayes, decision tree or logistic regression, whereas lexicon-based sentiment analysis uses either general or domain-based lexicons. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of domain lexicons vis-{\`a}-vis general lexicon, wherein we have performed aspect-level sentiment analysis on data from three different domains, viz. car, guitar and book. While it is intuitive that domain lexicons will always perform better than general lexicons, the actual performance however may depend on the richness of the concerned domain lexicon as well as the text analysed. We used the general lexicon SentiWordNet and the corresponding domain lexicons in the aforesaid domains to compare their relative performances. The results indicate that domain lexicon used along with general lexicon performs better as compared to general lexicon or domain lexicon, when used alone. They also suggest that the performance of domain lexicons depends on the text content; and also on whether the language involves technical or non-technical words in the concerned domain. This paper makes a case for development of domain lexicons across various domains for improved performance, while gathering that they might not always perform better. It further highlights that the importance of general lexicons cannot be underestimated --- the best results for aspect-level sentiment analysis are obtained, as per this paper, when both the domain and general lexicons are used side by side.},

@article{alnawas_2019_sentiment_analysis_of_iraqi_arabic_dialect_on_facebook_based_on_distributed_representations_of_documents,
	abstract = {Nowadays, social media is used by many people to express their opinions about a variety of topics. Opinion Mining or Sentiment Analysis techniques extract opinions from user generated contents. Over the years, a multitude of Sentiment Analysis studies has been done about the English language with deficiencies of research in all other languages. Unfortunately, Arabic is one of the languages that seems to lack substantial research, despite the rapid growth of its use on social media outlets. Furthermore, specific Arabic dialects should be studied, not just Modern Standard Arabic. In this paper, we experiment sentiments analysis of Iraqi Arabic dialect using word embedding. First, we made a large corpus from previous works to learn word representations. Second, we generated word embedding model by training corpus using Doc2Vec representations based on Paragraph and Distributed Memory Model of Paragraph Vectors (DM-PV) architecture. Lastly, the represented feature used for training four binary classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes) to detect sentiment. We also experimented different values of parameters (window size, dimension and negative samples). In the light of the experiments, it can be concluded that our approach achieves a better performance for Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine than the other classifiers.},

	abstract = {Digital resources such as smart applications reviews and online feedback information are important sources to seek customers' feedback and input. This paper aims to help government entities gain insights on the needs and expectations of their customers. Towards this end, we propose an aspect-based sentiment analysis hybrid approach that integrates domain lexicons and rules to analyse the entities smart apps reviews. The proposed model aims to extract the important aspects from the reviews and classify the corresponding sentiments. This approach adopts language processing techniques, rules, and lexicons to address several sentiment analysis challenges, and produce summarized results. According to the reported results, the aspect extraction accuracy improves significantly when the implicit aspects are considered. Also, the integrated classification model outperforms the lexicon-based baseline and the other rules combinations by 5\% in terms of Accuracy on average. Also, when using the same dataset, the proposed approach outperforms machine learning approaches that uses support vector machine (SVM). However, using these lexicons and rules as input features to the SVM model has achieved higher accuracy than other SVM models.},

@article{liu_2019_attention_based_sentiment_reasoner_for_aspect_based_sentiment_analysis,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a powerful way of predicting the sentiment polarity of text in natural language processing. However, understanding human emotions and reasoning from text like a human continues to be a challenge. In this paper, we propose a model, named Attention-based Sentiment Reasoner (AS-Reasoner), to alleviate the problem of how to capture precise sentiment expressions in ABSA for reasoning. AS-Reasoner assigns importance degrees to different words in a sentence to capture key sentiment expressions towards a specific aspect, and transfers them into a sentiment sentence representation for reasoning in the next layer. To obtain appropriate importance degree values for different words in a sentence, two attention mechanisms we designed: intra attention and global attention. Specifically, intra attention captures the sentiment similarity between any two words in a sentence to compute weights and global attention computes weights by a global perspective. Experiments on all four English and four Chinese datasets show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and macro-F1 results for aspect term level sentiment analysis and obtains the best accuracy for aspect category level sentiment analysis. The experimental results also indicate that AS-Reasoner is language-independent.},

The system performs a complete fine grain analysis, where the most important characteristics or aspects of an opinion are identified in order to determine their sentiment associated. The unsupervised approach used allows to extract, identify and sentiment classify, from the analysis of opinions in Spanish in a specific domain, allowing to scale to another language and domain with great ease. For the validation of AspectSA, several experiments were carried out using corpus of opinions in the restaurant domain. The results obtained exceeded the majority of existing systems for the Spanish language.},

@article{qin_2021_exploring_the_distribution_regularities_of_user_attention_and_sentiment_toward_product_aspects_in_online_reviews,
	abstract = {Purpose
              To better understand the online reviews and help potential consumers, businessmen and product manufacturers effectively obtain users' evaluation on product aspects, this paper aims to explore the distribution regularities of users' attention and sentiment on product aspects from the temporal perspective of online reviews.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Temporal characteristics of online reviews (purchase time, review time and time intervals between purchase time and review time), similar attributes clustering and attribute-level sentiment computing technologies are used based on more than 340k smartphone reviews of three products from JD.COM (a famous online shopping platform in China) to explore the distribution regularities of users' attention and sentiment on product aspects in this paper.
            
            
              Findings
              The empirical results show that a power-law distribution can fit users' attention on product aspects, and the reviews posted in short time intervals contain more product aspects. Besides, the results show that the values of users' sentiment on product aspects are significantly higher/lower in short time intervals which contribute to judging the advantages and weaknesses of a product.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              This paper cannot acquire online reviews for more products with temporal characteristics to verify the findings because of the restriction on reviews crawling by the shopping platforms.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This work reveals the distribution regularities of users' attention and sentiment on product aspects, which is of great significance in assisting decision-making, optimizing review presentation and improving the shopping experience.},
