@article{lian_2022_a_normalized_rich_club_connectivity_based_strategy_for_keyword_selection_in_social_media_analysis,
	abstract = {In this paper, we present a study on keyword selection behavior in social media analysis that is focused on particular topics, and propose a new effective strategy that considers the co-occurrence relationships between keywords and uses graph-based techniques. In particular, we used the normalized rich-club connectivity considering the weighted degree, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and PageRank values to measure a subgroup of highly connected ``rich keywords'' in a keyword co-occurrence network. Community detection is subsequently applied to identify several keyword combinations that are able to accurately and comprehensively represent the researched topic. The empirical results based on four topics and comparing four existing models confirm the performance of our proposed strategy in promoting the quantity and ensuing the quality of data related to particular topics collected from social media. Overall, our findings are expected to offer useful guidelines on how to select keywords for social media-based studies and thus further increase the reliability and validity of their respective conclusions.},

Flight bans, new regulations, and restrictions increase consumer complaints and are emerging as a big problem for airline companies. Understanding the main reasons triggering complaints and eliminating service failures in the airline industry will be a vital strategic priority for businesses, while reviewing the dimensions of service quality during the COVID-19 pandemic provides an excellent opportunity for academic literature. In this study, 10,594 complaints against two major airlines that offer full-service and low-cost options were analyzed with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm to categorize them by essential topics. Results provide valuable information for both. Furthermore, this study fills the gap in the existing literature by proposing a decision support system to identify significant service failures through passenger complaints in the airline industry utilizing e-complaints during an unusual situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic.},

@article{kumar_2022_an_anomaly_detection_framework_for_twitter_data,
	abstract = {An anomaly indicates something unusual, related to detecting a sudden behavior change, and is also helpful in detecting irregular and malicious behavior. Anomaly detection identifies unusual events, suspicious objects, or observations that differ significantly from normal behavior or patterns. Discrepancies in data can be observed in different ways, such as outliers, standard deviation, and noise. Anomaly detection helps us understand the emergence of specific diseases based on health-related tweets. This paper aims to analyze tweets to detect the unusual emergence of healthcare-related tweets, especially pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19. After pre-processing, this work collected more than 44 thousand tweets and performed topic modeling. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) were deployed for topic modeling, and a query set was designed based on resultant topics. This query set was used for anomaly detection using a sentence transformer. K-means was also employed for clustering outlier tweets from the cleaned tweets based on similarity. Finally, an unusual cluster was selected to identify pandemic-like healthcare emergencies. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can detect a sudden rise of unusual tweets unrelated to regular tweets. The new framework was employed in two case studies for anomaly detection and performed with 78.57\% and 70.19\% accuracy.},

	abstract = {With the prevalence of the Internet and new media channels, consumer reviews have become one of the main determinants of Consumers' purchasing decisions. This paper uses the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to identify the key factors that are of major concern to consumers, including design factors, laptop setup factors, logistics factors, after-sales factors, and user experience factors. And, we classify these factors into product quality factors and supporting service factors for new products. We then explore the relationship between online reviews and purchase decisions under these different factors, and also further explore the impact of interactions between online review metrics on purchase decisions. Our findings suggest that the impact of online reviews on consumer purchase decisions also varies considerably across different consumer focus factors. In addition, we find that the impact of the interaction between online review features is complex. In particular, consumers do not follow the positive guidance and make purchase decisions as we would expect when confronted with a large number of positive emotional polarity online reviews. Meanwhile, the interaction between negative emotional polarity and variance of online reviews had no significant effect on consumer purchase decisions. The variance of online reviews has a limited role in reducing consumer risk perceptions triggered by negative emotional polarity. Our study provides new evidence for the study of the impact of online reviews through text mining.},

To address the problem of untimely handling of consumer complaints, based on the evolutionary game theory, the e-commerce dispute mediation platform is introduced, the authenticity of consumer complaints and the probability of e-commerce platform to be in the mediation platform are considered, a tripartite evolutionary game model of consumer-mediation platform-e-commerce platform is constructed, and the problem of which strategy the mediation platform and e-commerce platform choose to handle consumer complaints is studied. Numerical simulation and simulation analysis are conducted using MATLAB 2020b, and corresponding suggestions are given. The research results show that under certain conditions when the probability of mediation platform and e-commerce platform positively handling complaint increases or the penalty for consumer distortion complaint increases; when the probability of consumer's real complaint increases, the probability of mediation platform positively handling complaint increases; the consumer tend to choose real complaint, the mediation platform tends to choose positively handling strategy, the e-commerce platform positively enters the mediation platform, the mediation platform and consumer's behavior to the reputation of the e-commerce platform increases, which can promote the e-commerce platform to positively handle the consumer complaint.},

In this context, the aim of the paper is to analyze the dynamics of public opinion on Twitter in the first month after the start of the vaccination process in the UK, with a focus on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy messages. For this purpose, a dataset containing 5,030,866 tweets in English was collected from Twitter between 8 December 2020--7 January 2021. A stance analysis was conducted after comparing several classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The tweets associated to COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy were examined in connection with the major events in the analyzed period, while the main discussion topics were determined using hashtags, n-grams and latent Dirichlet allocation. The results of the study can help the interested parties better address the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy concerns.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              This study aims to identify the topics that users post on Twitter about organic foods and to analyze the emotion-based sentiment of those tweets. The study addresses a call for an application of big data and text mining in different fields of research, as well as proposes more objective research methods in studies on food consumption. There is a growing interest in understanding consumer choices for foods which are caused by the predominant contribution of the food industry to climate change. So far, customer attitudes towards organic food have been studied mostly with self-reported methods, such as questionnaires and interviews, which have many limitations. Therefore, in the present study, we used big data and text mining techniques as more objective methods to analyze the public attitude about organic foods. A total of 43,724 Twitter posts were extracted with streaming Application Programming Interface (API). Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was applied for topic modeling. A test of topic significance was performed to evaluate the quality of the topics. Public sentiment was analyzed based on the NRC emotion lexicon by utilizing
              Syuzhet
              package. Topic modeling results showed that people discuss on variety of themes related to organic foods such as plant-based diet, saving the planet, organic farming and standardization, authenticity, and food delivery, etc. Sentiment analysis results suggest that people view organic foods positively, though there are also people who are skeptical about the claims that organic foods are natural and free from chemicals and pesticides. The study contributes to the field of consumer behavior by implementing research methods grounded in text mining and big data. The study contributes also to the advancement of research in the field of sustainable food consumption by providing a fresh perspective on public attitude toward organic foods, filling the gaps in existing literature and research.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            After the development of Web 2.0 and social networks, analyzing consumers' responses and opinions in real-time became profoundly important to gain business insights. This study aims to identify consumers' preferences and perceptions of genderless fashion trends by text-mining, Latent Dirichlet Allocation-based topic modeling, and time-series linear regression analysis. Unstructured text data from consumer-posted sources, such as blogs and online communities, were collected from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020. We examined 9722 posts that included the keyword ``genderless fashion'' with Python 3.7 software. Results showed that consumers were interested in fragrances, fashion, and beauty brands and products. In particular, 18 topics were extracted: 13 were classified as fashion categories and 5 were derived from beauty and fragrance sectors. Examining the genderless fashion trend development among consumers from 2018 to 2020, ``perfume and scent'' was revealed as the hot topic, whereas ``bags,'' ``all-in-one skin care,'' and ``set-up suit'' were cold topics, declining in popularity among consumers. The findings contribute to contemporary fashion trends and provide in-depth knowledge about consumers' perceptions using big data analysis methods and offer insights into product development strategies.},

            In an effort to understand the legislative agenda setting impacts of social media content, the present study analyzes political discourse on Twitter regarding the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to dissect the Twitter conversation aimed at Representative Karen Bass, the sponsor of the H.R.7120, in the weeks leading up to the bill's filing, our analysis of nearly 68,000 tweets posted in the days before the bill's filing reveals that constituents strongly urged the Representative to work on legislation targeted on police reform -- offering evidence of how constituents demanded, and drove, legislative action. Considering our findings, we argue that there is considerable potential for social media to serve as an amplifier of social issues and concerns among constituents. Through this process, we posit that social media can prove to be a vital catalyst in social justice reform.},

@article{yang_2021_understanding_service_providers_competency_in_knowledge_intensive_crowdsourcing_platforms_an_lda_approach,
	abstract = {Knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing (KIC) is becoming one of the most promising domains of crowdsourcing by leveraging human intelligence and building a large labor-intensive service network. In this network, the service providers (SPs) constitute the backbone of the KIC platform and play an important role in connecting the platform and service requesters. The SPs are a group of distributed crowds with a complex composition and high level of uncertainty, resulting in great challenges in service quality and platform management. Understanding the SPs' competency is an effective way for the platform to manage them. Therefore, we attempt to connect the competency analysis to the environment of KIC to investigate and identify the criteria of SPs' competency (i.e., the competency factors and dimensions required for being competent for the SPs' business). To this end, we leverage the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to explore and extract hidden competency dimensions from online interview records. We then introduce the competency theory to identify and label the competency factors and dimensions and construct the three-level KSAT competency model, which presents a comprehensive vision of the SPs' performance standards in the context of KIC. Given the competency criteria in the KSAT competency model, we use the Best-Worst Method (BWM) to determine their weights, which reflect their importance when evaluating the SPs' competency from the platforms' perspective. The results show that skill and knowledge are the two most important competency factors, and customer relationship management and communication ability are the two most valuable competency dimensions when evaluating the SPs' competency. Furthermore, the KSAT competency model can be applied to analyze the competency of individuals or organizations in many other industries as well.},

@article{shi_2021_fault_diagnosis_of_signal_equipment_on_the_lanzhou_xinjiang_high_speed_railway_using_machine_learning_for_natural_language_processing,
	abstract = {The Lanzhou-Xinjiang (Lan-Xin) high-speed railway is one of the principal sections of the railway network in western China, and signal equipment is of great importance in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the high-speed railway. Over a long period, in the railway operation and maintenance process, the railway signaling and communications department has recorded a large amount of unstructured text information about equipment faults in the form of natural language. However, due to irregularities in the recording methods of these data, it is difficult to use directly. In this paper, a method based on natural language processing (NLP) was adopted to analyze and classify this information. First, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model was used to extract the semantic features of the text, which were then expressed in the corresponding topic feature space. Next, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used to construct a signal equipment fault diagnostic model that reduced the impact of sample data imbalance on the classification accuracy. This was compared and analyzed with the traditional Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms. This study used signal equipment failure text data from the Lan-Xin high-speed railway to conduct experimental analysis and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments showed that the accuracy of the SVM classification algorithm could reach 0.84 after being combined with the LDA topic model, which verifies that the natural language processing method can effectively realize the fault diagnosis of signal equipment and has certain guiding significance for the maintenance of field signal equipment.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In today's era, company performance is influenced by quick and easy responses to interacting with users. Twitter is one of the social media which is believed that public opinion on Twitter can influence the government or companies to make policies. Public criticism on Twitter is more quickly responded than people who contacting customer service directly, this is because the companies or government do not want their image to be bad due to delays in responding to public complaints on Twitter. Studies related to opinion writing on social media can use the method of topic modeling and sentiment analysis in order to get what topics are currently being discussed and also the value of their sentiments. Modeling of the topic was carried out using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and sentiment analysis using the Indonesian Sentiment Lexicon. A case study of public opinion on BPJS Kesehatan using Twitter data for 3 months from February to April 2020, obtained 5 main topics with the BPJS Kesehatan's New Contribution Rate as a trending topic with a sentiment value of 61.7\% positive and 38.3\% negative.},

@article{barnes_2021_empirical_identification_of_skills_gaps_between_chief_information_officer_supply_and_demand_a_resource_based_view_using_machine_learning,
	abstract = {Purpose
              The role of emerging digital technologies is of growing strategic importance as it provides significant competitive advantage to organisations. The chief information officer (CIO) plays a pivotal role in facilitating the process of digital transformation. Whilst demand continues to increase, the supply of suitably qualified applicants is lacking, with many companies forced to choose information technology (IT) or marketing specialists instead. This research seeks to analyse the organisational capabilities required and the level of fit within the industry between CIO requirements and appointments via the resource-based view.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Job postings and CIO curriculum vitae were collected and analysed through the lens of organisational capability theory using the machine learning method of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
            
            
              Findings
              This research identifies gaps between the capabilities demanded by organisations and supplied by CIOs. In particular, soft, general, non-specific capabilities are over-supplied, while rarer specific skills, qualifications and experience are under-supplied.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The research is useful for practitioners (e.g. potential CIO candidates) to understand current market requirements and for companies aiming to develop internal training that meet present and future skill gaps. It also could be useful for professional organisations (e.g. CIO Forum) to validate the need to develop mentoring schemes that help meet such high demand and relative undersupply of qualified CIOs.
            
            
              Originality/value
              By applying LDA, the paper provides a new research method and process for identifying competence requirements and gaps as well as ascertaining job fit. This approach may be helpful to other domains of research in the process of identifying specific competences required by organisations for particular roles as well as to understand the level of fit between such requirements and a potential pool of applicants. Further, the study provides unique insight into the current supply and demand for the role of CIO through the lens of resource-based view (RBV). This provides a contribution to the stream of information systems (IS) research focused on understanding CIO archetypes and how individual capabilities provide value to companies.},

	abstract = {During the Covid-19 pandemic, almost all community activities are conducted from home. Therefore, video conference technology is needed for people to carry out their normal activities from home. One of the video conference applications is ZOOM Cloud Meetings. Applications certainly have been reviewed given by their users as a reference for new users and companies of the application to know the application's performance. However, in reviews, some constraints are the number of reviews as well as irregular. Therefore, a solution is needed with sentiment analysis that aims to classify the reviews of the application to be organized by categorizing positive or negative sentiment. In this study, aspect-based sentiment analysis was conducted on ZOOM Cloud Meetings app reviews from Google Play Store. The analysis's result of the review data obtained three aspects, namely aspects of usability, system, and appearance. The modeling topic used is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method and classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). This research resulted in the best performance with the best parameters resulting in the performance accuracy of usability aspect is 88.83\%, system aspect with 91.2\%, appearance aspect with 94.78\%, and performance accuracy of all aspects 91.61\%.},

Conclusion   The results of this study clearly show the structural and topic status of research COVID-19 projects approved in Iran during the COVID-19 epidemic. Extended Abstract  Background and Objectives   In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, researchers around the world have conducted various studies on different dimensions of the disease. The researchers and various research teams have designed and conducted an extensive range of studies related to COVID-19 including epidemiology, disease surveillance, consequences of the disease, and clinical trials. In Iran, different ongoing or completed research projects have also been approved to identify various aspects of the disease. Research project proposals are documents prepared by researchers to carry out research projects and are formulated according to particular demands for research in the society on various subjects such as disease burden, epidemics, threats and natural factors. Therefore, this study investigated the structure and topics of COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran.  Material and Methods   This applied research, adopting an analytical approach, was conducted using bibliometric and text mining methods. The statistical population was the COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran in 2020. These research projects were extracted from the database of Iran national committee for ethics in biomedical research (ethics.research.ac.ir). To identify the topics of the research projects on COVID-19bytheir English titles, topic modeling algorithms were used in the Python programming language.This database, includes the bibliographic data of all research projects which have been approved by the medical sciences, received implementation ethics license. The projects related to medical sciences are registered in this database to receive an ethics code before implementation; thus, all Iranian projects within COVID-19 topical area are registered in this database before being implemented, and their bibliographic data can be retrieved and accessed. After extracting data related to the approved COVID-19 research projects from the mentioned database, a topical modeling algorithm named Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was employed to identify the topics of research projects by the English titles of COVID-19 approved research projects in Iran, using text mining techniques. Text mining process employed in this study includes three stages; (1) data preprocessing (2) implementation of text mining and visualization techniques, and (3) the analysis of results and knowledge extraction. In the present investigation, Python programming language and its libraries related to text mining, such as Gensim, NLTK, and Spacy, were used to implement text mining algorithms. Results  We selected a total of 6641 COVID-19 research projects approved and conducted in 93 different Iranian universities and research centers. .of the main bulk of the research in this area had been conducted by Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, and Shiraz University of Medical Sciences including 687,662, and 351 cases respectively. The highest number of research projects approved in Iran included 1238, 796, 796 cases in April, May, and March, respectively. The results also revealed that the researchers to contribute most, as the main executor, to the approved research projects included Amir Vahedian Azimi from Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Jamshid Yazdani Charati from Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Ramin Sami from Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and Hossein Sheybani from Shahroud University of Medical Sciences each of whom had had 12 research projects approved. The results of text mining techniques also indicated that the terms COVID, patients, evaluation, hospital, and disease were among the most frequent words used in the titles of COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran.The results obtained from topical modeling have identified 12 distinct themes for the research projects in this area, including treatment, care needs of medical staff, factors of disease severity, mental health and preventive behavior, diagnostic and laboratory studies, Immunology studies, vitamins and minerals, cardiovascular diseases, vaccine studies, job and life stress, experiences of nurses, patients and their families and prevalence and symptoms. Conclusion  In the present study, bibliometric and text mining techniques were applied to identify the topical structure of COVID-19 research projects approved in Iran. The results of this study clearly depicted the structural and topic status of research COVID-19 projects approved in Iran during the COVID-19 epidemic. The results seem to be useful for planners and policy-makers in research and medical organizations to identify topics that are understudied by researchers and also to formulate new research priorities and requirements in this field. Practical Implications of Research  This research has used bibliometric and text mining techniques to identify the thematic structure of research projects approved by Covid-19 in Iran. The results of this study can be useful for planners and policy makers in research and medical organizations in order to identify topics that are less frequently considered by researchers and also to formulate new research priorities and requirements in this field. Ethical Considerations  The present study was extracted from a research project approved by the Vice Chancellor for Research andTechnology of Gonabad University of Medical Sciences with the code A-10-1263-5. Conflict of Interest   The authors state that there is no conflict of interest in the present study. Aknowledgment   Researchers express their gratitude to the Vice Chancellor for Research, Technology and Infectious Diseases Research Center of Gonabad University of Medical Sciences for their financial and spiritual support of this research.},

@article{wang_2021_technology_hotspot_tracking_topic_discovery_and_evolution_of_chinas_blockchain_patents_based_on_a_dynamic_lda_model,
	abstract = {Tracking scientific and technological (S\&T) research hotspots can help scholars to grasp the status of current research and develop regular patterns in the field over time. It contributes to the generation of new ideas and plays an important role in promoting the writing of scientific research projects and scientific papers. Patents are important S\&T resources, which can reflect the development status of the field. In this paper, we use topic modeling, topic intensity, and evolutionary computing models to discover research hotspots and development trends in the field of blockchain patents. First, we propose a time-based dynamic latent Dirichlet allocation (TDLDA) modeling method based on a probabilistic graph model and knowledge representation learning for patent text mining. Second, we present a computational model, topic intensity (TI), that expresses the topic strength and evolution. Finally, the point-wise mutual information (PMI) value is used to evaluate topic quality. We obtain 20 hot topics through TDLDA experiments and rank them according to the strength calculation model. The topic evolution model is used to analyze the topic evolution trend from the perspectives of rising, falling, and stable. From the experiments we found that 8 topics showed an upward trend, 6 topics showed a downward trend, and 6 topics became stable or fluctuated. Compared with the baseline method, TDLDA can have the best effect when K is 40 or less. TDLDA is an effective topic model that can extract hot topics and evolution trends of blockchain patent texts, which helps researchers to more accurately grasp the research direction and improves the quality of project application and paper writing in the blockchain technology domain.},

More specifically, extracting meaningful insights from this vast amount of data and grouping them based on their shared features without human intervention requires advanced methodologies. There are topic modeling methods to overcome this problem in text analysis for downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and news classification. In this research, we benchmark several classifiers, namely Random Forest, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, using the classical LDA and n-stage LDA topic modeling methods for feature extraction in headlines classification. We run our experiments on 3 and 5 classes publicly available Turkish and English datasets. We demonstrate that n-stage LDA as a feature extractor obtains state-of-the-art performance for any downstream classifier. It should also be noted that Random Forest was the most successful algorithm for both datasets.},

Citizens are the key factor in promoting a sustainable supply of natural resources and the high-quality development of urban areas. This study focuses on the co-production behaviours of citizens regarding urban natural resource assets in the age of big data, and uses the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm and the stepwise regression analysis method to evaluate citizens' experiences and feelings related to the urban capitalisation of natural resources. Results show that, firstly, the machine learning algorithm based on natural language processing can effectively identify and deal with the demands of urban natural resource assets. Secondly, in the experience of urban natural resources, citizens pay more attention to the combination of history, culture, infrastructure and natural landscape. Unique natural resource  can enhance citizens' sense of participation. Finally, the scenery, entertainment and quality and value of urban natural resources are the influencing factors of citizens' satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Indonesia is currently experiencing its fourth industrial revolution in the 21st century. With the introduction of the internet, Indonesia is expected to gain more than a hundred billion US Dollars and twenty-six million job openings by 2030. The rising usage of information technology prompts regulators to develop The Electronic Information Transaction Act to protect the populace from cybercrime. However, the law attracts numerous criticism due to its vague interpretation. This resulted in numerous arrests of innocents throughout Indonesia. Thus, the public is trying to voice their opinions on social media for the sake of preventing any more cases in the future. The usage of Latent Dirichlet Allocation could provide numerous benefits for this research. The separation between latent topics among random mixtures helps to identify the common ground and correlation between each post. These latent topics will be elaborated with a sample post to provide insights and expectations of the public towards the law.},

	abstract = {As a data tool applicable to the full life-cycle of construction engineering and management, Building Information Modeling (BIM) has great potential for significantly increasing project productivity and performance. Awareness of BIM application hotspots and forecasting its trends can drive innovations in construction field. Using patents as data resources, this study develops an effective framework integrating the citation network analysis and the topic clustering technology to identify BIM application information and forecast its trends. This framework comprises three-step analysis:(1) quantitative characteristic analysis of patent outputs; (2) Social Network Analysis (SNA)-based co-occurrence network analysis; and (3) identification of BIM topics using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Finally, the case demonstrates the effectiveness of this framework contributing to promote technological development and innovation of BIM. The contributions of this study are threefold: (1) an innovative text mining-based framework for BIM patent analysis in construction is developed; (2) patents that have focused on identifying the application hotspots and development trend of BIM in accordance with our developed framework are reviewed; and (3) a signpost for technological development and innovation of BIM is provided.},

@article{parlina_2021_exposing_emerging_trends_in_smart_sustainable_city_research_using_deep_autoencoders_based_fuzzy_c_means,
	abstract = {The literature discussing the concepts, technologies, and ICT-based urban innovation approaches of smart cities has been growing, along with initiatives from cities all over the world that are competing to improve their services and become smart and sustainable. However, current studies that provide a comprehensive understanding and reveal smart and sustainable city research trends and characteristics are still lacking. Meanwhile, policymakers and practitioners alike need to pursue progressive development. In response to this shortcoming, this research offers content analysis studies based on topic modeling approaches to capture the evolution and characteristics of topics in the scientific literature on smart and sustainable city research. More importantly, a novel topic-detecting algorithm based on the deep learning and clustering techniques, namely deep autoencoders-based fuzzy C-means (DFCM), is introduced for analyzing the research topic trend. The topics generated by this proposed algorithm have relatively higher coherence values than those generated by previously used topic detection methods, namely non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and eigenspace-based fuzzy C-means (EFCM). The 30 main topics that appeared in topic modeling with the DFCM algorithm were classified into six groups (technology, energy, environment, transportation, e-governance, and human capital and welfare) that characterize the six dimensions of smart, sustainable city research.},
