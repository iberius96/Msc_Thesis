	abstract = {We do not trust technologies like we trust people, rather we rely on them. This article argues for an emphasis on reliance rather than trust as a concept for understanding human relationships with technology. Reliance is important because researchers can empirically measure the reliability of a given technology. We first explore two frameworks of trust and reliance. We then examine how reliance can be measured by conducting systematic literature reviews of reported success metrics for given technologies. Specifically, we examine papers which present models for predicting private traits from social media data. Of the 72 models for predicting private traits that were surveyed from 31 papers, 80\% of the methods reported success rates lower than 90\%, indicating a general unreliability in predicting private traits. We illustrate the current applicability of this method throughout the article by discussing the Cambridge Analytica scandal that began during the 2016 US Presidential election.},

	abstract = {AbstractInternet users are increasing over time. The increasing of internet users, especially for youth people, tends to create internet addiction in each user. Internet addiction in youth people is interesting to know their attitudes and behavior psychologically, because it is related to their daily conditions. This research was conducted to answer the psychological dynamics of youth people with internet addiction. To answer that, there are some research questions such as what factors make young people addicted to the internet? what do they feel when not using the internet? and what are the impacts of using the internet for them? The research method uses qualitative methods with narrative descriptive approaches. Data analysis using thematic data analysis. The results showed that 1) the need for affiliation, high curiosity about information, and online business became the reason youth people access the internet, 2) youth people feel anxious and loneliness when not accessing the internet, 3) the impact of accessing the internet such as sad and happy on their emotions that occur according to situations and conditions. In addition, researchers also found interesting things from their attitude who experienced boredom when often using the internet but failed for them to stop or reduce access to the internet. The conclusion that the internet now is a necessary for youth people, because the internet has a major impact on their psychological factors. AbstrakPengguna internet semakin bertambah dari waktu ke waktu. Jumlah penggunanaan internet yang semakin meningkat khususnya pada anak muda cenderung dapat menciptakan kecanduan internet pada diri masing-masing pengguna. Kecanduan internet pada anak muda menarik untuk diketahui sikap dan perilakunya secara psikologis, karena hal itu berkaitan dengan kondisi keseharian mereka. Penelitian ini dilakukan untuk menjawab dinamika psikologis anak muda yang kecanduan internet. Untuk menjawab hal itu, terdapat beberapa pertanyaan penelitian seperti faktor apa yang membuat anak muda kecanduan internet? apa yang mereka rasakan ketika tidak menggunakan internet? serta apa dampak dari penggunaan internet bagi mereka? Metode penelitian menggunakan metode kualitatif dengan pendekatan naratif deskripif. Analisis data menggunakan analisis data tematik. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa 1) kebutuhan untuk afliasi, keingintahuan yang tinggi terhadap informasi, dan bisnis online menjadi alasan anak muda mengakses internet, 2) anak muda merasa cemas dan kesepian ketika tidak mengakses internet, 3) dampak dari mengakses internet berupa perasaan sedih dan senang pada emosi mereka yang terjadi sesuai situasi dan kondisi. Selain itu, peneliti juga menemukan hal yang menarik dari sikap mereka yang mengalami kebosanan ketika sering bermain internet namun gagal bagi mereka untuk berhenti maupun mengurangi dalam mengakses internet. Kesimpulan bahwa internet saat ini sudah menjadi kebutuhan anak muda, karena internet berdampak besar pada faktor psikologis mereka.},

@article{zheng_efficient_2022,
	abstract = {The key issue at this stage is how to mine the large amount of valuable user sentiment information from the massive amount of web text and create a suitable dynamic user text sentiment analysis technique. Hence, this study offers a writing feature abstraction process based on ON-LSTM and attention mechanism to address the problem that syntactic information is ignored in emotional text feature extraction. The study found that the Att-ON-LSTM improved the micro-average F1 value by 2.27\% and the macro-average F value by 1.7\% compared to the Bi-LSTM model with the added attentivity mechanisms. It is demonstrated that it can perform better extraction of semantic information and hierarchical structure information in emotional text and obtain more comprehensive emotional text features. In addition, the ON-LSTM-LS, a sentiment analysis model based on ON-LSTM and tag semantics, is planned to address the problem that tag semantics is ignored in the process of text sentiment analysis. The experimental consequences exposed that the accuracy of the ON-LSTM and labeled semantic sentiment analysis model on the test set is improved by 0.78\% with the addition of labeled word directions compared to the model Att-ON-LSTM without the addition of labeled semantic information. The macro-averaged F1 value improved by 1.04\%, which indicates that the sentiment analysis process based on ON-LSTM and tag semantics can effectively perform the text sentiment analysis task and improve the sentiment classification effect to some extent. In conclusion, deep learning models for dynamic user sentiment analysis possess high application capabilities.},

@article{peng_sbtm_2021,
	abstract = {Large quantities of textual posts are increasingly generated in course discussion forums, and the accumulation of these data greatly increases the cognitive loads on online participants. It is imperative for them to automatically identify the potential semantic information derived from these textual discourse interactions. Moreover, existing topic models can discover the latent topics or sentimental polarities from textual data, but these models typically ignore the interactive ways of discussing topics, thus making it difficult to further construct topics' semantic space from the perspective of document generation. To solve this issue, we proposed a joint sentiment and behaviour topic model called SBTM, which was an unsupervised approach for automatic analysis of learners' discussed posts. The results demonstrated that SBTM was quantitatively effective on both model generalisation and topic exploration, and rich topic content was qualitatively characterised. Furthermore, the model can be potentially employed in some practical applications, such as information summarisation and behaviour-oriented personalised recommendation.},
