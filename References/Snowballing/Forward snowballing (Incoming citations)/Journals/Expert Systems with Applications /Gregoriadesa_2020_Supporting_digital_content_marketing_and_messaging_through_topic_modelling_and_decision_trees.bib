@article{nastisin_gender_2021,
	abstract = {Objective - In the current time of pandemic crisis, social media is one of the most effective tools for ecommerce to keep in touch with customers. One of the most affected segments worldwide is undoubtedly the tourist segment. Our goal was to examine the perception of selected aspects of social media in the light of gender differences during a pandemic in the tourist segment, when these can convince or discourage the customer to buy.

Methodology/Technique - Data collection took place from the beginning of 2021 and lasted 3 months. It was an online questionnaire and focused on customers of travel agencies. A total of 723 valid responses were collected. These were analyzed for statistical significance of gender differences using SPSS software.

Findings - The results identified significant differences in perceptions between men and women in some of the areas examined. The best forms of content that work best on these platforms have been identified. Attitudes towards communication through social media for marketing purposes were also identified. These were perceived positively in order to support purchasing decisions. We also identified a great need for personalization in communication via social media in a given tourist segment.

Novelty - All findings show great implication potential for both theory and practice. The pandemic situation has changed market conditions and many of these changes will persist beyond. There is therefore a need to examine these contexts in the future. Managers in the tourism segment are able to incorporate the identified results into the way they manage their online activities and manage their social media.

Type of Paper - Empirical

Keywords: Social Media; Ecommerce; Tourism; Pandemic; Differences; Analysis.

	abstract = {El marketing digital ha modificado la forma de operar de los negocios a nivel internacional, teniendo en cuenta el auge que ha alcanzado el uso de las tecnolog{\'\i}as de la informaci{\'o}n y las comunicaciones. En las organizaciones tur{\'\i}sticas, estas herramientas desempe{\~n}an un rol fundamental en el proceso de adquirir nuevos clientes, retener y crear relaciones con ellos con el objetivo de promover y vender los productos y servicios de la organizaci{\'o}n. En este contexto, el marketing digital resulta una estrategia imprescindible para las marcas por la gran oportunidad de crecimiento, posicionamiento y difusi{\'o}n que representan. La presente investigaci{\'o}n tiene como objetivo general desarrollar un procedimiento para la gesti{\'o}n del marketing digital en organizaciones tur{\'\i}sticas que favorezca el proceso de comercializaci{\'o}n de las mismas. Para ello se emplearon diferentes m{\'e}todos, te{\'o}ricos, emp{\'\i}ricos y estad{\'\i}sticos, los cuales permitieron dise{\~n}ar el procedimiento propuesto. La aplicaci{\'o}n de dicho procedimiento en el Hotel Brisas Guardalavaca permiti{\'o} perfeccionar las herramientas de redes sociales, comercio electr{\'o}nico e email marketing elevando as{\'\i} los indicadores de interacci{\'o}n.
