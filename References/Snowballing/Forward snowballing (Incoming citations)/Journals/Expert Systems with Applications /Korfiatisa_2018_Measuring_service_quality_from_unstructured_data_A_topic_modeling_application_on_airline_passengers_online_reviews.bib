	abstract = {The aim of this study is to propose a methodology to define the positioning of airlines in terms of their online reputation measured with quantitative variables and applied in the airline industry. Reviews shared on the Internet give key information about service quality and value as perceived by customers. To carry out the empirical study, we obtained the information available on TripAdvisor about airlines in Europe, the USA, Canada, and other countries in America, differentiating also between airlines that follow a low-cost strategy and those that do not apply it. The results show that there is a significant difference in key service quality variables between airlines in the different geographical areas studied on the one hand, and the low-cost strategy applied on the other. The variables to be used to conduct the positioning analysis in the airlines are determined. They also show that the methodology has relevant practical implications and provides tools to further develop research related to the online reputation and strategic positioning of airlines.},

@article{amat-lefort_quality_2022,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Quality 4.0 is a new paradigm of quality management, which emphasises the need to adapt to recent technological innovations by updating traditional quality approaches. Amongst the most important factors for adopting Quality 4.0 is the leveraging of big data to collect insights and quality perceptions from clients. Therefore, user reviews have emerged as a valuable source of information, which can be analysed through machine learning procedures to uncover latent quality dimensions.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study applies a combination of text mining techniques to analyse Airbnb reviews, identifying service quality attributes and assessing their relation to the users' sentiment. More than two million reviews written by guests in four European cities are analysed. First, topic modelling is applied to find the quality attributes mentioned by reviewers. Then, sentiment analysis is used to assess the positiveness/negativeness of the users' feedback.
            
            
              Findings
              A total of 37 quality attributes are identified. Four of them show a significant positive relation to the guest's sentiment: apartment views, host tips and advice, location and host friendliness. On the other hand, the following attributes are negatively correlated with user sentiment: sleep disturbance, website responsiveness, thermal management and hygiene issues.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper provides a practical example of how Quality 4.0 can be implemented, proposing a data-driven methodology to extract service quality attributes from user-generated content. Additionally, several attributes that had not appeared in existing Airbnb studies are identified, which can serve as a reference to extend previous quality assessment scales.},

	abstract = {Mental health attitude has huge impacts on the improvement of mental health. In response to the ongoing damage the COVID-19 pandemic caused to the mental health of the Chinese people, this study aims to explore the factors associated with mental health attitude in China. To this end, we extract the key topics in mental health-related microblogs on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, using the structural topic modeling (STM) approach. An interaction term of sentiment polarity and time is put into the STM model to track the evolution of public sentiment towards the key topics over time. Through an in-depth analysis of 146,625 Weibo posts, this study captures 12 topics that are, in turn, classified into four factors as stigma (n = 54,559, 37.21\%), mental health literacy (n = 32,199, 21.96\%), public promotion (n = 30,747, 20.97\%), and social support (n = 29,120, 19.86\%). The results show that stigma is the primary factor inducing negative mental health attitudes in China as none of the topics related to this factor are considered positive. Mental health literacy, public promotion, and social support are the factors that could enhance positive attitudes towards mental health, since most of the topics related to these factors are identified as positive ones. The provision of tailored strategies for each of these factors could potentially improve the mental health attitudes of the Chinese people.},

	abstract = {Objectives
              Live-streaming fitness is perceived by the Chinese government as an invaluable means to reduce the prevalence of physical inactivity amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate the public altitudes of the Chinese people toward live-streaming fitness and provide future health communication strategies on the public promotion of live-streaming fitness accordingly.
            
            
              Methods
              This study collected live-streaming fitness-related microblog posts from July 2021 to June 2022 in Weibo, the Chinese equivalent to Twitter. We used the BiLSTM-CNN model to carry out the sentiment analysis, and the structured topic modeling (STM) method to conduct content analysis.
            
            
              Results
              This study extracted 114,397 live-streaming fitness-related Weibo posts. Over 80\% of the Weibo posts were positive during the period of the study, and over 85\% were positive in half of the period. This study finds 8 topics through content analysis, which are fitness during quarantine; cost reduction; online community; celebrity effect; Industry; fitness injuries; live commerce and Zero Covid strategy.
            
            
              Conclusions
              It is discovered that the public attitudes toward live-streaming fitness were largely positive. Topics related to celebrity effect (5--11\%), fitness injuries (8--16\%), live commerce (5--9\%) and Zero Covid strategy (16--26\%) showed upward trends in negative views of the Chinese people. Specific health communication strategy suggestions are given to target each of the negative topics.},

	abstract = {Monitoring of dual service failures (e.g., trends in service failures and consecutive service failures) in business is emphasized for service quality management. Previous studies analyzing negative online reviews to conduct dual service failure monitoring from a managerial perspective are scarce. Numerous negative online reviews are useful sources for dual service failure monitoring because they can be easily collected at a low cost. This article proposes a data-driven approach to monitor service failure trends and consecutive service failures from negative online reviews. In the proposed approach, first a classifier is developed to categorize newly collected negative reviews into service failures by Latent Dirichlet allocation. Subsequently, a threshold value is provided to identify a new type of service failure, which was not achieved previously using a control chart. Finally, the probability of consecutive service failures is obtained by association rule mining. A case study of Uber is conducted to validate the proposed approach. The results exhibit that the proposed approach can perform dual service failure monitoring. This study can increase marketing intelligence for dynamic management of service failure and allow rapid responses to service failures.},

@article{saydam_passengers_2022,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Although a vast amount of research has been started to gauge customer satisfaction using surveys, the influence of COVID-19 on passengers' satisfaction has not received enough attention. Hence, the primary purpose of this research is to determine the dominant themes that emerged from airline travelers' online reviews and to determine attributes that are pertinent to the satisfaction of passengers flying with low-cost carriers (LCC) during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, this study investigates whether the salient themes of passengers' overall experiences vary by traveler origin, which may give more insight into airline sector market segmentation.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Leximancer software was used to construct concepts from words, followed by themes in the data analysis.
            
            
              Findings
              The analyses revealed eight themes in descriptions of ``travel experiences'' for airline passengers. These are ``flights,'' ``staff,'' ``service,'' ``hygiene,'' ``cancellations,'' ``legroom,'' ``COVID-19'' and ``test''. Negative reviews associated with ``cancellations,'' ``refund,'' ``waiting'' and ``baggage'' (handling) concepts.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The findings provide important information about airline passengers' overall experiences. Limited studies have comprehensively considered various satisfaction categories of airline travelers using online reviews.},

@article{celuch_customers_2020,
	abstract = {Purpose
              In search of creating an extraordinary experience for customers, services have gone beyond the means of a transaction between buyers and sellers. In the event industry, where purchasing tickets online is a common procedure, it remains unclear as to how to enhance the multifaceted experience. This study aims at offering a snapshot into the most valued aspects for consumers and to uncover consumers' feelings toward their experience of purchasing event tickets on third-party ticketing platforms.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This is a cross-disciplinary study that applies knowledge from both data science and services marketing. Under the guise of natural language processing, latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling and sentiment analysis were used to interpret the embedded meanings based on online reviews.
            
            
              Findings
              The findings conceptualized ten dimensions valued by eventgoers, including technical issues, value of core product and service, word-of-mouth, trustworthiness, professionalism and knowledgeability, customer support, information transparency, additional fee, prior experience and after-sales service. Among these aspects, consumers rated the value of the core product and service to be the most positive experience, whereas the additional fee was considered the least positive one.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Drawing from the intersection of natural language processing and the status quo of the event industry, this study offers a better understanding of eventgoers' experiences in the case of purchasing online event tickets. It also provides a hands-on guide for marketers to stage memorable experiences in the era of digitalization.},

@article{leem_using_2021,
	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this study is to propose a method of measuring service quality as well as suggesting to detect customer complaints through analysis of customer online reviews of mobile bank, which is unstructured data.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study uses text mining approach for customer online reviews analysis. The research procedure includes: (1) extracting users' reviews for Kakao Mobile Bank, (2) pre-processing of the extracted review data, (3) analyzing the sentiment of each review, (4) measuring the service quality score of each dimension by analyzing keyword frequency and network for each polarity, (5) evaluating total score for mobile bank service quality, and (6) detecting customer complaints on online reviews.
            
            
              Findings
              There are some findings. First, from the customer's point of view, it was possible to see which factors are important among the various dimensions of service quality and which factors should be managed well in mobile banking setting. Second, by periodically finding customer complaints, service failures can be prevented early, and service quality and customer satisfaction can be improved.
            
            
              Practical implications
              From a practical point of view, mobile bank managers should pay more attention to the service quality dimensions of practicality and enjoyment. In addition, the results mean that the app design and aesthetics with the most negative reviews should be reviewed from the user's perspective rather than from the company's point of view. Second, it is possible for them to establish a systematic complaint management system that can prevent service failure in advance by detecting customer complaints early. Third, it is possible for them to make quick decisions regarding service quality with the help of real-time customer response through dashboard construction.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper is a pioneer study measuring service quality with sentiment analysis, one of the text mining applications, using customers' reviews of a mobile bank.},

	abstract = {This study aims to examine key attributes affecting Airbnb users' satisfaction and dissatisfaction through the analysis of online reviews. A corpus that comprises 59,766 Airbnb reviews form 27,980 listings located in 12 different cities is analyzed by using both Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and supervised LDA (sLDA) approach. Unlike previous LDA based Airbnb studies, this study examines positive and negative Airbnb reviews separately, and results reveal the heterogeneity of satisfaction and dissatisfaction attributes in Airbnb accommodation. In particular, the emergence of the topic ``guest conflicts'' in this study leads to a new direction in future sharing economy accommodation research, which is to study the interactions of different guests in a highly shared environment. The results of topic distribution analysis show that in different types of Airbnb properties, Airbnb users attach different importance to the same service attributes. The topic correlation analysis reveals that home like experience and help from the host are associated with Airbnb users' revisit intention. We determine attributes that have the strongest predictive power to Airbnb users' satisfaction and dissatisfaction through the sLDA analysis, which provides valuable managerial insights into priority setting when developing strategies to increase Airbnb users' satisfaction. Methodologically, this study contributes by illustrating how to employ novel approaches to transform social media data into useful knowledge about customer satisfaction, and the findings can provide valuable managerial implications for Airbnb practitioners.},

This analysis involves identifying the necessary labels to determine whether a comment is positive, negative, or neutral, and the intensity with which the customer's sentiment is expressed. Based on this information, service companies such as airlines can design and implement a communication strategy to improve their customers' image of the company and the service received. This study proposes a methodology to identify the significant labels that represent the customers' sentiments, based on a quantitative variable, that is, the overall rating. The key labels were identified in the comments' titles, which usually include the words that best define the customer experience. This database was applied to more extensive online customer reviews in order to validate that the identified tags are meaningful for assessing the sentiments expressed in them. The results show that the labels elaborated from the titles are valid for analyzing the feelings in the comments, thus, simplifying the labels to be taken into account when carrying out a sentiment analysis of customers' online comments.},

@article{he_voice_2020,
	abstract = {Many web-based pharmaceutical e-commerce platforms allow consumers to post open-ended textual reviews based on their purchase experiences. Understanding the true voice of consumers by analyzing such a large amount of user-generated content is of great significance to pharmaceutical manufacturers and e-commerce websites. The aim of this paper is to automatically extract hidden topics from web-based drug reviews using the structural topic model (STM) to examine consumers' concerns when they buy drugs online. The STM is a probabilistic extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which allows the consolidation of document-level covariates. This innovation allows us to capture consumer dissatisfaction along with their dynamics over time. We extract 12 topics, and five of them are negative topics representing consumer dissatisfaction, whose appearances in the negative reviews are substantially higher than those in the positive reviews. We also come to the conclusion that the prevalence of these five negative topics has not decreased over time. Furthermore, our results reveal that the prevalence of price-related topics has decreased significantly in positive reviews, which indicates that low-price strategies are becoming less attractive to customers. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first study using STM to analyze the unstructured textual data of drug reviews, which enhances the understanding of the aspects of drug consumer concerns and contributes to the research of pharmaceutical e-commerce literature.},

	abstract = {Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sales of fast-food businesses have dropped sharply. Customer satisfaction has always been one of the key factors for the sustainable development of enterprises. However, in the fast-food restaurant business, gaining the knowledge of customer satisfaction is one of the critical tasks. Moreover, text reviews in social media have become one of important reference sources for customers' decisions in buying services and products. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to explore whether customer voices from social media reviews are different during the COVID-19 outbreak and to propose a new method to reduce interpersonal contact when collecting data. A text mining scheme which includes least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and decision trees (DT) are presented to discover the essential factors for customers to increase their satisfaction from unstructured online customer reviews. Finally, three real world review sets were employed to validate the effectiveness of the presented text mining scheme. Experimental results can help companies to properly adapt to similar epidemic situations in the future and facilitate their sustainable development.},

	abstract = {The social sciences and digital humanities have recently adopted the machine learning technique of topic modeling to address research questions in their fields. This is problematic in a number of ways, some of which have not received much attention in the debate yet. This paper adds epistemological concerns centering around the interface between topic modeling and linguistic concepts and the argumentative embedding of evidence obtained through topic modeling. It concludes that topic modeling in its present state of methodological integration does not meet the requirements of an independent research method. It operates from relevantly unrealistic assumptions, is non-deterministic, cannot effectively be validated against a reasonable number of competing models, does not lock into a well-defined linguistic interface, and does not scholarly model topics in the sense of themes or content. These features are intrinsic and make the interpretation of its results prone to apophenia (the human tendency to perceive random sets of elements as meaningful patterns) and confirmation bias (the human tendency to perceptually prefer patterns that are in alignment with pre-existing biases). While partial validation of the statistical model is possible, a conceptual validation would require an extended triangulation with other methods and human ratings, and clarification of whether statistical distinctivity of lexical co-occurrence correlates with conceputal topics in any reliable way.},

	abstract = {Current information exploration models present low-level features or technical aspects related to the paradigm used to generate results. While this may increase transparency, it does not help the user form a personal opinion about items because it does not describe the overall experience with them. In order to address this issue, we propose the INTERactivE viSualizaTion model (INTEREST) that supports the exploration and analysis of search results by means of a graphical representation of consumer feedback aimed at making the user aware of the service properties in all the stages of fruition, focusing on the data that is most relevant to her/him. INTEREST is based on the Service Journey Maps for the design and description of user experience with services. We applied it to the home booking domain by developing the Apartment Monitoring application that supports overviewing and analyzing online reviews about rented homes. In a user study, we compared the decision-making support provided by our application with that of a baseline model that enables a temporal filtering of consumer feedback. We found out that Apartment Monitoring outperforms the baseline in user experience, user awareness of item properties, and user control during the interaction with the system. In particular, according to the participants of the study, Apartment Monitoring describes the expectations about the homes and it supports their selection in a more effective way than the baseline. These findings encourage moving from a low-level description of item properties to a service-oriented one in order to improve users' decision-making capabilities.},

@article{zaki_ahmed_methodology_2022,
	abstract = {Online reputation is of great strategic importance to companies today. Customers share their emotions and experiences about the service received or the product acquired through online opinions in the form of quantitative variables or text comments. Although quantitative variables can be analyzed using different statistical methods, the main limitation of comment content analysis lies in the statistical analysis because the texts are qualitative. This study proposes and applies a methodology to develop a machine learning designed to identify the key labels related to the quantitative variables in the general rating of the service received from an airline. To this end, we create a quantitative dichotomous variable from zero to one from a database of comment title labels, thus facilitating the conversion of titles into quantitative variables. On this basis, we carry out a multiple regression analysis where the dependent variable is the overall rating and the independent variables are the labels. The results obtained are satisfactory, and the significant labels are determined, as well as their signs and coefficients with the general ratings. Findings show that the significant labels detected in titles positively influence the prediction of the overall rating of airline. This paper is a new approach to applying cluster analysis to the text content of customers' online reviews in an airline. Thus, the proposed methodology results in a quantitative value for the labels that determines the direction and intensity of customers' opinions. Moreover, it has important practical implications for managers to identify the weakness and the strengths of their services in order to increase their positioning in the market by developing meaningful strategies.},

@article{wang_discovery_2022,
	abstract = {Online reviews are key sources to help manufacturers design and improve their products. However, using online reviews for product redesign is challenging because many online reviews contain useless information, and customers rarely provide explicit information about the products. The few methods available to recognize the customers' demands from online reviews have several limitations, including failing to consider the redundancy of useless reviews, confusion in providing targeted information among different aspects of product design, and disregarding the manufacturing limitation. Hence, considering customer needs and manufacturing constraints for product improvement, this study proposes a new model called DPFR to discover the potential product features for redesign. In DPFR, it first analyzes and predicts helpfulness of reviews for more effective decision of product design and improvement, which is neglected in previous research. Then, a structured model based on topic modeling is conducted. Overlooked by previous researchers, DPFR also introduces a feature importance matric to measure the significance of each commented feature to product redesign. Third, a target features selection model is conducted further considering the limitations of manufacturers rather than only focusing on customer satisfaction. The effectiveness of the proposed model was assessed using a case study of data acquired from Bilibili, a large short-video platform in China. Focusing only on customer satisfaction, the results confirm the effectiveness of DPFR. Finally, including the constraints of product redesign, DPFR balances customer satisfaction and the manufacturing constraints such as redesign cost, redesign time, and carbon emissions. This study provides more practical suggestions for manufacturers to discover product redesign features that result in strategic product improvement decisions.},

	abstract = {The Jordanian economy is declining due to the political and economic conditions in the region, which caused more scarcity of resources and lowering the investment rate. Therefore, the services sector has become more important in the Jordanian labor market and the Contact Center Environment has become even more important. Yet, one of the most brilliant goals for the Contact Center is to lower the turnover rate and deliver the best service to the clients. This paper measured the impact of job satisfaction on turnover rate in the Contact Center Environment. Service providers at inbound call centers answered the questionnaires designed to measure the impact of their job satisfaction with its elements (social satisfaction, salaries, benefits, career growth and safety, psychological and physical environment) on their intent to turnover. 100 questionnaires were distributed randomly in different Contact Centers in the Jordanian labor market. Sixty-eight respondents were received, and the valid ones for analysis were 58. The research identifies a significant impact of Job safety and career growth as major variables that affect the intention and the turnover rate among employees in the Contact Center.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted both healthcare and the economy on a global scale. This pandemic has changed consumer habits and behaviors significantly, primarily because of confinement-related issues. While numerous research has been undertaken to study customer satisfaction using surveys and online passenger ratings, the effect of COVID-19 on passenger satisfaction has not been explored. It is vital to assess satisfaction indicators gathered from online consumer reviews to ascertain consumers' preferences for airline services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this study is to determine the primary themes that emerged from airline travelers' internet reviews during the COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, it attempts to determine which of these themes relate to higher and lower passenger satisfaction. The article uses qualitative (i.e., narratives) analyses to examine the main components of passengers' subjective experiences of the airline. Data are represented by passenger reviews posted on the TripAdvisor website. The analyses revealed ten themes in descriptions of airline travel experiences. These include ``flight'', ``service'', ``staff'', ``food'', ``check-in'', ``cancellation'', ``COVID-19'', ``airport'', ``class'', and ``luggage''. Dissatisfying concepts are linked with the ``cancellation'', ``check-in'', ``refund'', and ``airport'' concepts.},

	abstract = {Due to the massive number of products being produced every year in every industry, firms have witnessed a tremendous growth in innovation of methods to create a sustainable competitive advantage. For the past decade and with the availability of online consumer reviews, companies and researchers have developed many approaches utilizing electronic Word-of-Mouth to improve and develop products and services to outperform competitors. The purpose of this study is to construct an effective method to perform a better product comparative analysis based on online consumer reviews. We propose a novel framework called Teardown Joint Sentiment-Topic analysis model consisting of a combination of text analytical approaches incorporated with a developed method of the traditional teardown analysis product comparative approach. The proposed approach is fully unsupervised model that employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling to form topics which are classified according to their sentiments. Topics are then analyzed against competitive products and critical topics are identified using a developed teardown method. A case study analyzing online customer reviews of competing products in two domains (i.e., mobile phones and surveillance cameras) is conducted. The identified critical topics are further analyzed in view of products' specifications perspective. We found that the detected aspects of the selected products are indeed critical, and hence, they need to be improved in order to gain a competitive advantage. The significant result of this study shows that the proposed method is effective in conducting products comparative analysis and provides valuable insights into utilizing the consumer reviews for product development.},

@article{espino-rodriguez_influence_2021,
	abstract = {Purpose
              This study aims to examine the impact of the outsourcing of hotel departments on service quality measured through online customer reviews.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Three models were developed, considering three important online tourism reputation websites, to establish the relationship between the outsourcing of hotel activities and service quality.
            
            
              Findings
              The results show that in the three databases, hotel outsourcing has a negative influence on online reputation. A higher level of outsourcing reduces service quality, the percentage of recommendations and the value perceived by customers who carry out online reviews of these hotels. In addition, different models were established for each type of department.
            
            
              Originality/value
              To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper presents the first empirical study to analyse the relationship between the impact of process outsourcing and customers' online reviews. It is also the first empirical research to consider the relationship between outsourcing and ratings by hotel end-customers as a performance measure.
            
          , 
            
              外包活动对服务质量认知的影响：基于酒店顾客在线评论的实证研究研究目的
              通过分析在线顾客评论, 本研究旨在探索外包酒店部门活动对顾客服务质量的认知影响。
            
            
              研究设计/方法/途径
              为探知外包酒店活动和服务质量之间的关系, 本研究借用了三个重要的旅游在线评论网站建立了三个模型。
            
            
              研究结果
              研究结果表明再三项数据库中, 酒店外包对酒店的在线名声有负面影响。高程度的外包降低顾客对服务质量的评价, 推介率, 以及顾客对酒店的感知价值。此外, 本研究为酒店各项部门都建立了对应的不同模型。
            
            
              研究原创性/价值
              本论文作为对酒店外包活动对顾客在线评论影响的首次实证研究。本研究也是首次探讨外包和顾客评分作为一项绩效指标的研究。},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Selecting the appropriate academic journal is a priority issue for researchers in the process of publishing a manuscript. If researchers could quantify the research topic in terms of its fit with the journal requirements before the submission of a paper, then the assessment of journal suitability could be much easier. Basing any decision on journal impact factors alone might obviously result in a mismatch, eventual rejection and a consequent loss of time. Taking the twelve leading Tourism and Hospitality journals as a reference, the main research topics mentioned in the abstracts of 20,381 articles are identified, using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm and other text-mining techniques running the R programming language. Subsequently, a quantitative measure of the fit of the research topics in each journal is offered according to their frequency of occurrence. The results suggested that the importance of the topic-journal fit with respect to the impact factor depended on the variance of the fits among the journals. Finally, a guide of the most suitable journals for the topics is presented, based on the JCR impact factor and the fit of the topic. Some recommendations are likewise offered on the use of this methodology and its limitations.},
