	abstract = {Abstract
            Some factors in the product development process can increase success. Evaluating the risks and success factors is necessary for a more successful product development process. Some inadequacies arise in classical risk assessment methods due to the subjective nature of likelihood and severity ratings. Different probability and impact values can give the same risk size. Due to these inadequacies, doubts about the accuracy of risk prioritization may arise. In this study, a new risk prioritization model is proposed to eliminate these doubts and to consider their contribution to the success of the process they affect while prioritizing the risks, with a detailed literature review and the support of the experts of the applied company, the risks affecting the product development process. The importance levels of risks and success factors were calculated using the analytical hierarchy process. With the proposed model, unlike the classical method, when calculating the risk size, the risk weight and the total score from the success factors are added to the likelihood and severity values of the risk. Thus, companies will obtain more detailed and objective results, considering success factors and risk importance levels, and use the resources they allocate for risk reduction activities more efficiently.},

@article{jia_effectiveness_2021,
	abstract = {The application mode of army mobile communication networks is closely related to combat mission and application environment. Different combat missions and application environments result in different network structures and different service priorities, which requires a semi-automatic system to support the network scheme design. Therefore, evaluating the efficiency of network schemes generated by automatic planning is a problem that needs to be urgently addressed. In the past, researchers have proposed a variety of methods to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile communication systems, most of which are based on simulation methods and ignore the historical data of network usage. This paper studies an effectiveness evaluation method of mobile communication network design schemes and proposes a design scheme for the evaluation and optimization of network plans. Furthermore, the improved method of effectiveness evaluation based on factor analysis is discussed in detail. The method not only effectively uses historical data but also reduces the amount of data collection and calculation. In order to adapt to the preference requirements of different task scenarios, a decision preference setting method based on cluster analysis is proposed, which can render the output optimization result more reasonable and feasible.},

@article{danilova_pipeline_2021,
	abstract = {With the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown, social media became a vital communication tool. The sudden outburst of online activity influenced information spread and consumption patterns. It increases the relevance of studying the dynamics of social networks and developing data processing pipelines that allow a comprehensive analysis of social media data in the temporal dimension. This paper scopes the weekly dynamics of the information space represented by Russian social media (Twitter and LiveJournal) during a critical period (massive COVID-19 outbreak and first governmental measures). The approach is twofold: 1) build the time series of topic similarity indicators by identifying COVID-related topics in each week and measuring user contribution to the topic space, and 2) cluster user activity and display user-topic relationships on graphs in a dashboard application. The paper describes the development of the pipeline, explains the choices made and provides a case study of the adaptation to virus control measures. The results confirm that social processes and behavior in response to pandemic-triggered changes can be successfully traced in social media. Moreover, the adaptation trends revealed by psychological and sociological studies are reflected in our data and can be explored using the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Vojvodina Province (Northern Serbia) represents a multicultural area inhabited by around thirty nations and national or ethnic groups with their authentic tradition and culture. The gastronomy of Vojvodina has been forming as a reflection of geographic characteristics---natural conditions and social events in this area. The life numerous nations share on this fertile soil of Vojvodina has initiated mutual impact of various customs, which contributed to the creation of a unique and specific Vojvodina cuisine. In this paper, mixed-method research approach was applied. The application of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was preceded by a survey research on the sample of 289 guests in the restaurants on the territory of Vojvodina. The aim of the research was to define the key motives when choosing a traditional Vojvodina dish. In the second stage, AHP model was used for ranking factors significant for choosing traditional food by 29 experts in the field of hospitality and gastronomy. The result shows that Sensory appeal is the most important criterion for choosing traditional food in restaurants by the experts, followed by Health concern, and Familiarity.},

@article{liu_what_2022,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Despite a significant focus on customer evaluation and sentiment analysis, limited attention has been paid to discrete emotional perspective in terms of the emotionality used in text. This paper aims to extend the general-sentiment dictionary in Chinese to a restaurant-domain-specific dictionary, visualize spatiotemporal sentiment trends, identify the main discrete emotions that affect customers' ratings in a restaurant setting and identify constituents of influential emotions.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              
                A total of 683,610 online restaurant reviews downloaded from
                Dianping.com
                were analyzed by a sentiment dictionary optimized by the authors; the main emotions (joy, love, trust, anger, sadness and surprise) that affect online ratings were explored by using multiple linear regression methods. After tracking these sentiment review texts, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and LDA models with term frequency-inverse document frequency as weights were used to find the factors that constitute influential emotions.
              
            
            
              Findings
              The results show that it is viable to optimize or expand sentiment dictionary by word similarity. The findings highlight that love and anger have the highest effect on online ratings. The main factors that constitute consumers' anger (local characteristics, incorrect food portions and unobtrusive location) and love (comfortable dining atmosphere, obvious local characteristics and complete supporting services) are identified. Different from previous studies, negativity bias is not observed, which poses a question of whether it has to do with Chinese culture.
            
            
              Practical implications
              These findings can help managers monitor the true quality of restaurant service in an area on time. Based on the results, restaurant operators can better decide which aspects they should pay more attention to; platforms can operate better and can have more manageable webpage settings; and consumers can easily capture the quality of restaurants to make better purchase decisions.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study builds upon the existing general sentiment dictionary in Chinese and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the first to provide a restaurant-domain-specific sentiment dictionary and use it for analysis. It also reveals the constituents of two prominent emotions (love and anger) in the case of restaurant reviews.},

	abstract = {This research presents optimization of the fastest route using Drone. Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones (VRPD) is used for planning the mapping of areas with minimal makespan. Drone point route design aims to mapping the area with considering the boundaries. In this paper, an optimization method using the Tabu Search algorithm and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to resolve VRPD problems is proposed. Tabu Search algorithm is suitable for the implementation of Vehicle Routing Problem because it is able to find the closest distance optimally with guiding other processes using a series of movements to change one solution to another. The optimization process using Tabu Search can find a suitable pair of points so that the closest route can be found. AHP is used for the weighting process and determining the hierarchy of route selection by prioritizing routes that meet the criteria and the appropriate weights. The optimization resulted in a 7.08\% reduction in the distance and significantly reduce the makespan as well as the metaheuristic approach. Experimental processes and performance analysis are carried out to find that this method can consistently produce better and optimal solutions.

	abstract = {The rapidly expanding e-health market tends to reinvent the roles of science, entrepreneurship, and state. However, the results of such reinvention remain unclear. This study investigates the decade-long history (2011--2021) of the promotion of techno-scientific biomedical communication by pro-government non-profit organizations in Russia. In 2021, the World Bank pointed out that digital technologies have played a critical role in the pandemic in Russia and Russia's economic recovery is gathering pace. Thus, Russia tends to correspond to many other emerging health markets. We compare texts from non-profit organizations' websites and Facebook accounts with official state actions and the national mass media health agenda. The instruments that were used for text mining were topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation and an algorithm for keyphrase relationship visualization.
