	abstract = {Purpose
              With the wealth of information available on the World Wide Web, it is difficult for anyone from a general user to the researcher to easily fulfill their information need. The main challenge is to categorize the documents systematically and also take into account more valuable data such as semantic information. The purpose of this paper is to develop a concept-based search system that leverages the external knowledge resources as the background knowledge for getting the accurate and efficient meaningful search results.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The paper introduces the approach which is based on formal concept analysis (FCA) with the semantic information to support the document management in information retrieval (IR). To describe the semantic information of the documents, the system uses the popular knowledge resources WordNet and Wikipedia. By using FCA, the system creates the concept lattice as the concept hierarchy of the document and proposes the navigation algorithm for retrieving the hierarchy based on the user query.
            
            
              Findings
              The semantic information of the document is based on the two external popular knowledge resources; the authors find that it will be more efficient to deal with the semantic mismatch problems of user need.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The navigation algorithm proposed in this research is applied to the scientific articles of the National Science Foundation (NSF). The proposed system can enhance the integration and exploration of the scientific articles for the advancement of the Scientific and Engineering Research Community.},

@article{aznar-sanchez_analysis_2020,
	abstract = {Greenhouse farming is an agricultural management system that has demonstrated its efficiency in intensifying food production. These systems constitute a feasible alternative for ensuring food supply, which is one of the greatest challenges faced by humankind in the twenty-first century. Technology has been able to meet the challenges related to greenhouse farming in both contributing to overcoming its limitations, correcting adverse impacts and ensuring system sustainability. The objective of this article is to analyse the global research trends in greenhouse technology over the last two decades, in order to identify the main driving agents, the most outstanding research lines and possible gaps in the literature. Different methodologies have been used for the analysis; both quantitative and qualitative. The principal results show that there are different relevant lines of research related to different aspects of greenhouse farming: the use of water for irrigation, the design of the optimum structure of the greenhouse, conserving the soil in the best growing conditions, energy consumption of the system as a whole, climate control within the facility and pest control. The research is characterized by the being composed largely of ad hoc studies, which hinders the international collaboration between researchers and institutions. The research approach has shifted from being focused on increasing production and cost savings to aspects related to resource conservation and sustainability.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that causes severe respiratory illness in humans, which results in global outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) currently. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving coronaviruses as well as COVID-19 by using topic modeling.
          
          
            Methods
            We extracted all abstracts and retained the most informative words from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, which contains 35,092 pieces of coronavirus related literature published up to March 20, 2020. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling, we trained a topic model from the corpus, analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections.
          
          
            Results
            Eight topics emerged overall: clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. It was observed that current COVID-19 research puts more emphasis on clinical characterization, epidemiological study, and virus transmission. In contrast, topics about diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, genomics and pathogenesis only account for less than 10\% or even 4\% of all the COVID-19 publications, much lower than those of other CoV infections.
          
          
            Conclusions
            These results identified knowledge gaps in the area of COVID-19 and offered directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Many business owners face struggles in determining their prices even with great experience and knowledge in their fields. The present paper addresses one case of this issue: a professional and entrepreneur that offers mechanical and lathe services in his own workshop. The goal of this work was to map the intuitive pricing process of the entrepreneur through a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). Many fuzzy aspects such as the imprecision, uncertainty, and ambiguity of these lathe and maintenance services were related to the potential benefits of FIS, clarifying which methods were used and why. This FIS was constructed to mimic the empirical pricing process of the referred professional and, in this task, this project was successful. Output surfaces showed that complexity and goods value have significant effects just above medium levels and that their impact has a smaller weight than the estimated time.

@article{aznar-sanchez_forest_2018,
	abstract = {The relevance of forests to sustain human well-being and the serious threats they face have led to a notable increase of research works on forest ecosystem services during the last few years. This paper analyses the worldwide research dynamics on forest ecosystem services in the period from 1998 to 2017. A bibliometric analysis of 4284 articles was conducted. The results showed that the number of published research articles has especially increased during the last five years. In total, 68.63\% of the articles were published in this period. This research line experiences a growing trend superior to the general publishing trend on forest research. In spite of this increase, its relative significance within the forest research is still limited. The most productive subject areas corresponded to Environmental Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences and Social Sciences Economic topics are understudied. The scientific production is published in a wide range of journals. The three first publishing countries are United States, China and the United Kingdom. The most productive authors are attached to diverse research centres and their contributions are relatively recent. A high level of international cooperation has been observed between countries, institutions and authors. The findings of this study are useful for researchers since they give them an overview of the worldwide research trends on forest ecosystem services.},

@article{feng_performance_2022,
	abstract = {Understanding the performance of the data mining approach and topic evolution in a certain scientific domain is imperative to capturing key domain developments and facilitating knowledge transfer within and across domains. Our research selects linguistics as an exploratory domain and exploits the feature maximization (FM) measurement for feature selection, combined with the contrast ratio to conduct the diachronic analysis for the linguistics domain's topics. To accurately mine the linguistics domain's topics and obtain the optimal clustering model selection, we exploit an integrated method associated with the deep embedding for clustering (DEC) algorithm based on the keywords-based Text Representation Matrix (KTRM) and Lamirel's EC index and test the performance of this method. The results show that the FM measurement is applicable in the linguistics domain for topic mining, and the combinatory method has the advantage of an unbiased clustering optimization model and applies to the design of non-parameter clustering and algorithms from the low dimension to the high dimension of datasets. The findings suggest that this approach could be suitable for a diachronic analysis of topic evolution and facilitate the performance of topic detection. In addition, these findings of text detection can rise to knowledge fusion cognition with the factor of language as an available research objective in interdisciplinary research.},

	abstract = {Irrigated agriculture plays a fundamental role as a supplier of food and raw materials. However, it is also the world's largest water user. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of studies analyzing agricultural irrigation from the perspective of sustainability with a focus on its environmental, economic, and social impacts. This study seeks to analyze the dynamics of global research in sustainable irrigation in agriculture between 1999 and 2018, including the main agents promoting it and the topics that have received the most attention. To do this, a review and a bibliometric analysis were carried out on a sample of 713 articles. The results show that sustainability is a line of study that is becoming increasingly more prominent within research in irrigation. The study also reveals the existence of substantial differences and preferred topics in the research undertaken by different countries. The priority issues addressed in the research were climatic change, environmental impact, and natural resources conservation; unconventional water resources; irrigation technology and innovation; and water use efficiency. Finally, the findings indicate a series of areas related to sustainable irrigation in agriculture in which research should be promoted.},

@article{liu_predicting_2019,
	abstract = {The advancement of science, as outlined by Popper and Kuhn, is largely qualitative, but with bibliometric data, it is possible and desirable to develop a quantitative picture of scientific progress. Furthermore, it is also important to allocate finite resources to research topics that have the growth potential to accelerate the process from scientific breakthroughs to technological innovations. In this paper, we address this problem of quantitative knowledge evolution by analyzing the APS data sets from 1981 to 2010. We build the bibliographic coupling and co-citation networks, use the Louvain method to detect topical clusters (TCs) in each year, measure the similarity of TCs in consecutive years, and visualize the results as alluvial diagrams. Having the predictive features describing a given TC and its known evolution in the next year, we can train a machine learning model to predict future changes of TCs, i.e., their continuing, dissolving, merging, and splitting. We found the number of papers from certain journals, the degree, closeness, and betweenness to be the most predictive features. Additionally, betweenness increased significantly for merging events and decreased significantly for splitting events. Our results represent the first step from a descriptive understanding of the science of science (SciSci), towards one that is ultimately prescriptive.},

	abstract = {The combination of new-generation information technology and manufacturing technology has had in a significant and profound impact on the future development paradigm of manufacturing. Machine tools are the basis of virtually everything that is manufactured in the industry, exploring the development of the machine tool domain is of considerable significance to identify the opportunity to develop manufacturing industry and promote the sustainable development of manufacturing in the current tightening constraints of resource environment. Although much attention has been paid to development studies of a specific domain in recent years, it is challenging to conduct a multidimensional study related to the development status of the machine tool domain using existing methods. To solve this challenge, we propose an integrating framework combining topic models, bibliometric, trend analysis and patent analysis to mine multi-source literature within the machine tool domain, including papers, funds, patents, and news. Specifically, papers and funds provided two different perspectives to explore the development status in the research of machine tools. Furthermore, the technology development of machine tools was investigated through patents analysis. Finally, news related to the machine tool industry in recent years was analyzed to examine business focuses on machine tools. The integration of above various analytical methods and multi-dimensional mining of literature enabled analyzing the development of the machine tool domain systematically from multi-perspectives that include research, technology development and industry to provide inspirations about the implications of sustainable development of this domain. The conclusions obtained in this paper is beneficial to different communities of machine tools, in terms of determining the research directions for researchers, identifying industry opportunities for corporations and developing reasonable industry policy for policy makers.},

@article{rincon-patino_exploring_2018,
	abstract = {Background:
              Machine learning researches algorithms that allow a machine to learn about resolving problems in different application domains. Due to the wide number of machine learning applications, it is necessary for newcomers to the field to have alternatives to explore this field faster.
            
            
              Methods:
              In this paper, we present a science mapping analysis on the machine learning research in the period 2007-2017. This study was develop using the CiteSpace tool based on results from Clarivate Web of Science. This analysis shows how the field has evolved, by highlighting the most notable authors, institutions, keywords, countries, categories, and journals.
            
            
              Results:
              The results provide information on trends and possibilities in the near future, particularly in areas such as health, biology and banking, where machine learning is a valuable tool to generate solutions.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Machine learning is being widely studied, and several institutions in countries like the USA and China constantly generate machine learning based solutions. Diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer's disease, studies in biology, such as the protein molecule, virtual reality, commerce, smartphones, and ubiquitous computing, are all fields where machine learning contributes to resolving problems.},
