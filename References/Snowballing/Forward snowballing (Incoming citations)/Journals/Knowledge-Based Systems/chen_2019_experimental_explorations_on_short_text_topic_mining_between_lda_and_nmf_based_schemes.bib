@article{pattnaik_2022_perspectives_of_non_expert_users_on_cyber_security_and_privacy_an_analysis_of_online_discussions_on_twitter,
	abstract = {Current research on users` perspectives of cyber security and privacy related to traditional and smart devices at home is very active, but the focus is often more on specific modern devices such as mobile and smart IoT devices in a home context. In addition, most were based on smaller-scale empirical studies such as online surveys and interviews. We endeavour to fill these research gaps by conducting a larger-scale study based on a real-world dataset of 413,985 tweets posted by non-expert users on Twitter in six months of three consecutive years (January and February in 2019, 2020 and 2021). Two machine learning-based classifiers were developed to identify the 413,985 tweets. We analysed this dataset to understand non-expert users` cyber security and privacy perspectives, including the yearly trend and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We applied topic modelling, sentiment analysis and qualitative analysis of selected tweets in the dataset, leading to various interesting findings. For instance, we observed a 54\% increase in non-expert users` tweets on cyber security and/or privacy related topics in 2021, compared to before the start of global COVID-19 lockdowns (January 2019 to February 2020). We also observed an increased level of help-seeking tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis revealed a diverse range of topics discussed by non-expert users across the three years, including VPNs, Wi-Fi, smartphones, laptops, smart home devices, financial security, and security and privacy issues involving different stakeholders. Overall negative sentiment was observed across almost all topics non-expert users discussed on Twitter in all the three years. Our results confirm the multi-faceted nature of non-expert users` perspectives on cyber security and privacy and call for more holistic, comprehensive and nuanced research on different facets of such perspectives.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Text preprocessing is not only an essential step to prepare the corpus for modeling but also a key area that directly affects the natural language processing (NLP) application results. For instance, precise tokenization increases the accuracy of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and retaining multiword expressions improves reasoning and machine translation. The text corpus needs to be appropriately preprocessed before it is ready to serve as the input to computer models. The preprocessing requirements depend on both the nature of the corpus and the NLP application itself, that is, what researchers would like to achieve from analyzing the data. Conventional text preprocessing practices generally suffice, but there exist situations where the text preprocessing needs to be customized for better analysis results. Hence, we discuss the pros and cons of several common text preprocessing methods: removing formatting, tokenization, text normalization, handling punctuation, removing stopwords, stemming and lemmatization, n-gramming, and identifying multiword expressions. Then, we provide examples of text datasets which require special preprocessing and how previous researchers handled the challenge. We expect this article to be a starting guideline on how to select and fine-tune text preprocessing methods.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Extremism has grown as a global problem for society in recent years, especially after the apparition of movements such as jihadism. This and other extremist groups have taken advantage of different approaches, such as the use of Social Media, to spread their ideology, promote their acts and recruit followers. The extremist discourse, therefore, is reflected on the language used by these groups. Natural language processing (NLP) provides a way of detecting this type of content, and several authors make use of it to describe and discriminate the discourse held by these groups, with the final objective of detecting and preventing its spread. Following this approach, this survey aims to review the contributions of NLP to the field of extremism research, providing the reader with a comprehensive picture of the state of the art of this research area. The content includes a first conceptualization of the term extremism, the elements that compose an extremist discourse and the differences with other terms. After that, a review description and comparison of the frequently used NLP techniques is presented, including how they were applied, the insights they provided, the most frequently used NLP software tools, descriptive and classification applications, and the availability of datasets and data sources for research. Finally, research questions are approached and answered with highlights from the review, while future trends, challenges and directions derived from these highlights are suggested towards stimulating further research in this exciting research area.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The communication of corporate social responsibility (CSR) highlights the behavior of the business toward CSR and their framework of sustainable development (SD), thus helping policymakers understand the role businesses play with respect to the 2030 Agenda. Despite its importance, this is still a relatively underexamined and emerging topic. In our paper, we focus on what businesses communicate about CSR through social media and how this relates to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We identified the topics discussed on Twitter, their evolution over time, and the differences across sectors. We applied the structural topic model (STM) algorithm, which allowed us to estimate the model, including document-level metadata (time and sector). This model proved to be a powerful tool for topic detection and the estimation of the effects of time and sector on the discussion proportion of the topics. Indeed, we found that the topics were well identified overall, and the model allowed catching signals from the data. We derived CSR communication indexes directly from the topic model (TM) results and propose the use of dissimilarity and homogeneity indexes to describe the communication mix and highlight differences and identify clusters.},

@article{kars_unluoglu_2022_migrants_as_dissonant_harmony_seekers_and_migrant_life_in_foam,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Migration of the Turkish new middle-class -- high-skilled, well-educated, young professionals -- has been growing in recent years. This paper explores their migration experience and discusses the role of physical and virtual bubbles in the formation of transnational communities and processes of adjustment to a new place.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This paper is based on a qualitative inquiry collecting data via semi-structured interviews with 18 London-based Turkish migrants and a digital ethnographic study of three Facebook groups that bring together the Turkish migrant community in Richmond, London.
            
            
              Findings
              Findings indicate that the migration of the new middle class differs conceptually from existing typologies. The paper proposes the concept of ``dissonant harmony-seekers'' and elaborates on their interactions to demonstrate that, in the Internet age, the traditional image of migrants living in isolated localised bubbles is no longer accurate. Findings also indicate a pragmatic and functional engagement with the bubbles, with migrants sporadically interacting with the bubbles to meet their individual needs in information, education and employment. 
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper contributes to the literature with the concept of dissonant harmony-seekers, which will gain more visibility in a world where the trend of democratic decline and rising authoritarianism will motivate a migratory move for people who confront a moral dissociation from the civil order in their homeland. The engagement of dissonant harmony-seekers with migrant communities challenges the conventional thinking that social identity is central to creating and maintaining bubbles. The other contribution of the paper to the literature is the metaphor of ``foam'' to capture the ephemeral and fugacious nature of the dynamics of migrant communities and practices.},

@article{clissa_2022_analyzing_wlcg_file_transfer_errors_through_machine_learning_an_automatic_pipeline_to_support_post_mortem_distributed_data_management,
	abstract = {Abstract
            The increasingly growing scale of modern computing infrastructures solicits more ingenious and automatic solutions to their management. Our work focuses on file transfer failures within the Worldwide Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid and proposes a pipeline to support distributed data management operations by suggesting potential issues to investigate. Specifically, we adopt an unsupervised learning approach leveraging Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning tools to automatically parse error messages and group similar failures. The results are presented in the form of a summary table containing the most common textual patterns and time evolution charts. This approach has two main advantages. First, the joint elaboration of the error string and the transfer's source/destination enables more informative and compact troubleshooting, as opposed to inspecting each site and checking unique messages separately. As a by-product, this also reduces the number of errors to check by some orders of magnitude (from unique error strings to unique categories or patterns). Second, the time evolution plots allow operators to immediately filter out secondary issues (e.g. transient or in resolution) and focus on the most serious problems first (e.g. escalating failures). As a preliminary assessment, we compare our results with the Global Grid User Support ticketing system, showing that most of our suggestions are indeed real issues (direct association), while being able to cover 89\% of reported incidents (inverse relationship).},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Objectives
              The focus of this paper is to introduce an automated early Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) detection scheme from colour fundus images through enhanced segmentation and classification strategies by analyzing blood vessels.
            
            
              Methods
              The occurrence of DR is increasing from the past years, impacting the eyes due to a sudden rise in the glucose level of blood. All over the world, half of the people who are under age 70 are severely suffered from diabetes. The patients who are affected by DR will lose their vision during the absence of early recognition of DR and appropriate treatment. To decrease the growth and occurrence of loss of vision, the early detection and timely treatment of DR are desirable. At present, deep learning models have presented better performance using retinal images for DR detection. In this work, the input retinal fundus images are initially subjected to pre-processing that undergoes contrast enhancement by Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and average filtering. Further, the optimized binary thresholding-based segmentation is done for blood vessel segmentation. For the segmented image, Tri-level Discrete Level Decomposition (Tri-DWT) is performed to decompose it. In the feature extraction phase, Local Binary Pattern (LBP), and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCMs) are extracted. Next, the classification of images is done through the combination of two algorithms, one is Neural Network (NN), and the other Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The extracted features are subjected to NN, and the tri-DWT-based segmented image is subjected to CNN. Both the segmentation and classification phases are enhanced by the improved meta-heuristic algorithm called Fitness Rate-based Crow Search Algorithm (FR-CSA), in which few parameters are optimized for attaining maximum detection accuracy.
            
            
              Results
              The proposed DR detection model was implemented in MATLAB 2018a, and the analysis was done using three datasets, HRF, Messidor, and DIARETDB.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The developed FR-CSA algorithm has the best detection accuracy in diagnosing DR.},

@article{fraguas_sanchez_2022_actively_targeted_nanomedicines_in_breast_cancer_from_pre_clinal_investigation_to_clinic,
	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed tumors and the second leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. The use of nanosystems specifically targeted to tumor cells (active targeting) can be an excellent therapeutic tool to improve and optimize current chemotherapy for this type of neoplasm, since they make it possible to reduce the toxicity and, in some cases, increase the efficacy of antineoplastic drugs. Currently, there are 14 nanomedicines that have reached the clinic for the treatment of breast cancer, 4 of which are already approved (Kadcyla{\textregistered}, Enhertu{\textregistered}, Trodelvy{\textregistered}, and Abraxane{\textregistered}). Most of these nanomedicines are antibody--drug conjugates. In the case of HER-2-positive breast cancer, these conjugates (Kadcyla{\textregistered}, Enhertu{\textregistered}, Trastuzumab-duocarmycin, RC48, and HT19-MMAF) target HER-2 receptors, and incorporate maytansinoid, deruxtecan, duocarmicyn, or auristatins as antineoplastics. In TNBC these conjugates (Trodelvy{\textregistered}, Glembatumumab-Vedotin, Ladiratuzumab-vedotin, Cofetuzumab-pelidotin, and PF-06647263) are directed against various targets, in particular Trop-2 glycoprotein, NMB glycoprotein, Zinc transporter LIV-1, and Ephrin receptor-4, to achieve this selective accumulation, and include campthotecins, calicheamins, or auristatins as drugs. Apart from the antibody--drug conjugates, there are other active targeted nanosystems that have reached the clinic for the treatment of these tumors such as Abraxane{\textregistered} and Nab-rapamicyn (albumin nanoparticles entrapping placlitaxel and rapamycin respectively) and various liposomes (MM-302, C225-ILS-Dox, and MM-310) loaded with doxorubicin or docetaxel and coated with ligands targeted to Ephrin A2, EPGF, or HER-2 receptors. In this work, all these active targeted nanomedicines are discussed, analyzing their advantages and disadvantages over conventional chemotherapy as well as the challenges involved in their lab to clinical translation. In addition, examples of formulations developed and evaluated at the preclinical level are also discussed.},

@article{lokku_2022_optimized_scale_invariant_feature_transform_with_local_tri_directional_patterns_for_facial_expression_recognition_with_deep_learning_model,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Facial expression recognition (FER) is the process of identifying human expressions. People vary in their accuracy at recognizing the emotions of others. Use of technology to help people with emotion recognition is a relatively important research area. Various works have been conducted on automating the recognition of facial expressions. The main intent of this paper is to plan for the FER model with the aid of intelligent techniques. The proposed models consist of steps like data collection, face detection, optimized feature extraction and emotion recognition. Initially, the standard benchmark facial emotion dataset is collected, and it is subjected to face detection. The optimized scale-invariant feature transform (OSIFT) is adopted for feature extraction, in which the key points that are giving unique information are optimized by the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm. Two meta-heuristic algorithms like spotted hyena optimization and beetle swarm optimization (BSO) are merged to form the proposed spotted hyena-based BSO (SH-BSO). Also, the local tri-directional pattern is extracted, which is further combined with optimized SIFT. Here, the proposed SH-BSO is utilized for optimizing the number of hidden neurons of both deep neural network and convolutional neural network in such a way that the recognition accuracy could attain maximum.},

@article{egger_2021_identifying_hidden_semantic_structures_in_instagram_data_a_topic_modelling_comparison,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Intrigued by the methodological challenges emerging from text complexity, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of different topic modelling algorithms based on Instagram textual data.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              By taking Instagram posts captioned with \#darktourism as the study context, this research applies latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), correlation explanation (CorEx), and non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to uncover tourist experiences.
            
            
              Findings
              CorEx outperforms LDA and NMF by classifying emerging dark sites and activities into 17 distinct topics. The results of LDA appear homogeneous and overlapping, whereas the extracted topics of NMF are not specific enough to gain deep insights.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study assesses different topic modelling algorithms for knowledge extraction in the highly heterogeneous tourism industry. The findings unfold the complexity of analysing short-text social media data and strengthen the use of CorEx in analysing Instagram content.

            语意大解密：主题模型的比较
            
              研究目的
              基于对文本复杂性的兴趣, 本研究以Instagram文本数据为基准, 旨在比较不同主题建模的算法的有效性。
            
            
              研究方法
              本研究以标有 \#darktourism的Instagram帖子作为背景, 评估直观理解（LDA）, 相关解释（CorEx）和非负矩阵分解（NMF）在分析与黑暗观光相关的帖子的实用性。
            
            
              研究结果
              CorEx分析出17个新兴的黑暗景点和活动, 亦胜过LDA和NMF。虽然LDA能探讨出较多的主题数, 但它们的内容几乎重复。同样的, 尽管NMF适用于短文本数据, 但它提取出主题相当笼统且不够具体。
            
            
              原创性
              透过将营销和数据科学学科相结合, 本研究为分析非结构化的文本奠定了基础, 并证实了CorEx在分析短文本社交媒体数据（如Instagram数据）中的效益。

              Resultados
              CorEx supera a LDA y NMF al clasificar los sitios y actividades oscuros emergentes en 17 temas distintos. Los resultados de LDA son homog{\'e}neos y se superponen, mientras que los temas extra{\'\i}dos de NMF no son lo suficientemente espec{\'\i}ficos como para obtener conocimientos profundos.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a text-mining framework to systematically identify vanishing or newly formed topics in highly interdisciplinary and diverse fields like cognitive science. We apply topic modeling via non-negative matrix factorization to cognitive science publications before and after 2012; this allows us to study how the field has changed since the revival of neural networks in the neighboring field of AI/ML. Our proposed method represents the two distinct sets of topics in an interpretable, common vector space, and uses an entropy-based measure to quantify topical shifts. Case studies on vanishing (e.g., connectionist/symbolic AI debate) and newly emerged (e.g., art and technology) topics are presented. Our framework can be applied to any field or any historical event considered to mark a major shift in thought. Such findings can help lead to more efficient and impactful scientific discoveries.},

	abstract = {The richness of social media data has opened a new avenue for social science research to gain insights into human behaviors and experiences. In particular, emerging data-driven approaches relying on topic models provide entirely new perspectives on interpreting social phenomena. However, the short, text-heavy, and unstructured nature of social media content often leads to methodological challenges in both data collection and analysis. In order to bridge the developing field of computational science and empirical social research, this study aims to evaluate the performance of four topic modeling techniques; namely latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), Top2Vec, and BERTopic. In view of the interplay between human relations and digital media, this research takes Twitter posts as the reference point and assesses the performance of different algorithms concerning their strengths and weaknesses in a social science context. Based on certain details during the analytical procedures and on quality issues, this research sheds light on the efficacy of using BERTopic and NMF to analyze Twitter data.},

	abstract = {The literature discussing the concepts, technologies, and ICT-based urban innovation approaches of smart cities has been growing, along with initiatives from cities all over the world that are competing to improve their services and become smart and sustainable. However, current studies that provide a comprehensive understanding and reveal smart and sustainable city research trends and characteristics are still lacking. Meanwhile, policymakers and practitioners alike need to pursue progressive development. In response to this shortcoming, this research offers content analysis studies based on topic modeling approaches to capture the evolution and characteristics of topics in the scientific literature on smart and sustainable city research. More importantly, a novel topic-detecting algorithm based on the deep learning and clustering techniques, namely deep autoencoders-based fuzzy C-means (DFCM), is introduced for analyzing the research topic trend. The topics generated by this proposed algorithm have relatively higher coherence values than those generated by previously used topic detection methods, namely non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and eigenspace-based fuzzy C-means (EFCM). The 30 main topics that appeared in topic modeling with the DFCM algorithm were classified into six groups (technology, energy, environment, transportation, e-governance, and human capital and welfare) that characterize the six dimensions of smart, sustainable city research.},

The My-Trac application is dedicated to the research and development of these user-centered services to improve the multi-modal experience using various techniques. Among these techniques are preference extraction systems, which extract user information from social networks, such as Twitter. In this article, we present a system that allows to develop a profile of the preferences of each user, on the basis of the tweets published on their Twitter account. The system extracts the tweets from the profile and analyzes them using the proposed algorithms and returns the result in a document containing the categories and the degree of affinity that the user has with each category. In this way, the My-Trac application includes a recommender system where the user receives preference-based suggestions about activities or services on the route to be taken.},

@article{rudiger_2021_the_explanatory_power_of_citations_a_new_approach_to_unpacking_impact_in_science,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Citation analysis has been applied to map the landscape of scientific disciplines and to assess the impact of publications. However, it is limited in that it assumes all citations to be of equal weight. Doing away with this assumption could make such studies even more insightful. Current developments in this regard focus on the evaluation of the syntactic and semantic qualities of the text that surrounds citations. Still lacking, however, are computational techniques to unpack the thematic context in which citations appear. It is against this backdrop that we propose a text clustering approach to derive contextual aspects of individual citations and the relationship between cited and citing work in an automated and scalable fashion. The method reveals a focal publication's absorption and use within the scientific community. It can also facilitate impact assessments at all levels. In addition to analyzing individual publications, the method can also be extended to creating impact profiles for authors, institutions, disciplines, and regions. We illustrate our results based on a large corpus of full-text articles from the field of Information systems (IS) with the help of exemplary visualizations. In addition, we provide a case study, the scientific impact of the Technology acceptance model. This way, we not only show the usefulness of our method in comparison to existing techniques but also enhance the understanding of the field by providing an in-depth analysis of the absorption of a key IS theoretical base.},

@article{cheng_2020_tracking_disaster_footprints_with_social_streaming_data,
	abstract = {Social media has become an indispensable tool in the face of natural disasters due to its broad appeal and ability to quickly disseminate information. For instance, Twitter is an important source for disaster responders to search for (1) topics that have been identified as being of particular interest over time, i.e., common topics such as ``disaster rescue''; (2) new emerging themes of disaster-related discussions that are fast gathering in social media streams (Saha and Sindhwani 2012), i.e., distinct topics such as ``the latest tsunami destruction''. To understand the status quo and allocate limited resources to most urgent areas, emergency managers need to quickly sift through relevant topics generated over time and investigate their commonness and distinctiveness. A major obstacle to the effective usage of social media, however, is its massive amount of noisy and undesired data. Hence, a naive method, such as set intersection/difference to find common/distinct topics, is often not practical. To address this challenge, this paper studies a new topic tracking problem that seeks to effectively identify the common and distinct topics with social streaming data. The problem is important as it presents a promising new way to efficiently search for accurate information during emergency response. This is achieved by an online Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) scheme that conducts a faster update of latent factors, and a joint NMF technique that seeks the balance between the reconstruction error of topic identification and the losses induced by discovering common and distinct topics. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets collected during Hurricane Harvey and Florence reveal the effectiveness of our framework.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            With the popularity of the Internet, real-time web news has been extensively used in human daily life. Because of competition and repetitive reporting between the media, there may be multiple similar news reporting the same searing event, which may waste a lot of time for users to obtain and read the similar news. Hence, how to rapid aggregating similar news to help users obtain relevant news information accurately is a very meaningful and essential study. However, the accuracy of the existing aggregation method needs to be strengthened, and it not meet real-time incremental processing requirements.
            In this paper, rapid incremental aggregating a lot of similar news headlines are our main study targets. We proposed a novel Rapidly Grouping Aggregation (RGA) method. It carries out similar news headline aggregation via two core aspects --- Improved Jaro-Winkler (IJW) similarity calculation, normalized mapping and rapidly grouping aggregation. The IJW using hierarchical matching windows to enhance the performance of similarity calculation, and using the MD5 normalization strategy and the Group By function of the MongoDB database to carry out the similarity news headline rapidly grouping. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, the actual system application results show that the RGA method achieves higher performance on similar news headline aggregation tasks.},

	abstract = {Tracking scientific and technological (S\&T) research hotspots can help scholars to grasp the status of current research and develop regular patterns in the field over time. It contributes to the generation of new ideas and plays an important role in promoting the writing of scientific research projects and scientific papers. Patents are important S\&T resources, which can reflect the development status of the field. In this paper, we use topic modeling, topic intensity, and evolutionary computing models to discover research hotspots and development trends in the field of blockchain patents. First, we propose a time-based dynamic latent Dirichlet allocation (TDLDA) modeling method based on a probabilistic graph model and knowledge representation learning for patent text mining. Second, we present a computational model, topic intensity (TI), that expresses the topic strength and evolution. Finally, the point-wise mutual information (PMI) value is used to evaluate topic quality. We obtain 20 hot topics through TDLDA experiments and rank them according to the strength calculation model. The topic evolution model is used to analyze the topic evolution trend from the perspectives of rising, falling, and stable. From the experiments we found that 8 topics showed an upward trend, 6 topics showed a downward trend, and 6 topics became stable or fluctuated. Compared with the baseline method, TDLDA can have the best effect when K is 40 or less. TDLDA is an effective topic model that can extract hot topics and evolution trends of blockchain patent texts, which helps researchers to more accurately grasp the research direction and improves the quality of project application and paper writing in the blockchain technology domain.},

@article{kang_2022_resilience_in_web_based_mental_health_communities_building_a_resilience_dictionary_with_semiautomatic_text_analysis,
	abstract = {Background
              Resilience is an accepted strengths-based concept that responds to change, adversity, and crises. This concept underpins both personal and community-based preventive approaches to mental health issues and shapes digital interventions. Online mental health peer-support forums have played a prominent role in enhancing resilience by providing accessible places for sharing lived experiences of mental issues and finding support. However, little research has been conducted on whether and how resilience is realized, hindering service providers' ability to optimize resilience outcomes.
            
            
              Objective
              This study aimed to create a resilience dictionary that reflects the characteristics and realization of resilience within online mental health peer-support forums. The findings can be used to guide further analysis and improve resilience outcomes in mental health forums through targeted moderation and management.
            
            
              Methods
              A semiautomatic approach to creating a resilience dictionary was proposed using topic modeling and qualitative content analysis. We present a systematic 4-phase analysis pipeline that preprocesses raw forum posts, discovers core themes, conceptualizes resilience indicators, and generates a resilience dictionary. Our approach was applied to a mental health forum run by SANE (Schizophrenia: A National Emergency) Australia, with 70,179 forum posts between 2018 and 2020 by 2357 users being analyzed.
            
            
              Results
              The resilience dictionary and taxonomy developed in this study, reveal how resilience indicators (ie, ``social capital,'' ``belonging,'' ``learning,'' ``adaptive capacity,'' and ``self-efficacy'') are characterized by themes commonly discussed in the forums; each theme's top 10 most relevant descriptive terms and their synonyms; and the relatedness of resilience, reflecting a taxonomy of indicators that are more comprehensive (or compound) and more likely to facilitate the realization of others. The study showed that the resilience indicators ``learning,'' ``belonging,'' and ``social capital'' were more commonly realized, and ``belonging'' and ``learning'' served as foundations for ``social capital'' and ``adaptive capacity'' across the 2-year study period.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study presents a resilience dictionary that improves our understanding of how aspects of resilience are realized in web-based mental health forums. The dictionary provides novel guidance on how to improve training to support and enhance automated systems for moderating mental health forum discussions.},

@article{luo_2022_exploring_energy_saving_refrigerators_through_online_e_commerce_reviews_an_augmented_mining_model_based_on_machine_learning_methods,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Based on climate issues and carbon emissions, this study aims to promote low-carbon consumption and compel consumers to actively shift to energy-saving appliances. In this big data era, online reviews in social and electronic commerce (e-commerce) websites contain valuable product information, which can facilitate firm business strategies and consumer comparison shopping. This study is designed to advance existing research on energy-saving refrigerators by incorporating machine learning models in the analysis of online reviews to provide valuable suggestions to e-commerce platform managers and manufacturers to effectively understand the psychological cognition of consumers.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study proposes an online e-commerce review mining and management strategy model based on ``data acquisition and cleaning, data mining and analysis and strategy formation'' through multiple machine learning methods, namely, Bayes networks, support vector machine (SVM), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and importance--performance analysis (IPA), to help managers.
            
            
              Findings
              Based on a case study of one of the largest e-commerce platforms in China, this study linguistically analyzes 29,216 online reviews of energy-saving refrigerators. Results indicate that the energy-saving refrigerator features that consumers are generally satisfied with are, in sequential order, logistics, function, price, outlook, after-sales service, brand, quality and space. This study also identifies ten topics with 100 keywords by analyzing 18 different refrigerator models. Finally, based on the IPA, this study allocates different priorities to the features and provides suggestions from the perspective of consumers, the government and manufacturers.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              In terms of limitations, future research may focus on the following points. First, the topics identified in this study derive from specific points in time and reviews; thus, the topics may change with the text data. A machine learning-based online review analysis platform could be developed in the future to dynamically improve consumer satisfaction. Moreover, given that consumers' needs may change over time, e-commerce platform types and consumer characteristics, such as user profiles, can be incorporated into the model to effectively analyze trends in consumers' perceived dimensions.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study fills the gap in previous research in this field, which uses small-sample data for qualitative analysis, while integrating management ideas and proposes an online e-commerce review mining and management strategy model based on machine learning methods. Moreover, this study considers how consumers' emotional and thematic preferences for products affect their purchase decision-making from the perspective of their psychological perception and linguistically analyzes online reviews of energy-saving refrigerators using the proposed mining model. Through the improved IPA model, this study provides optimizing strategies to help e-commerce platform managers and manufacturers.},

@article{truica_2021_topic_based_document_level_sentiment_analysis_using_contextual_cues,
	abstract = {Document-level Sentiment Analysis is a complex task that implies the analysis of large textual content that can incorporate multiple contradictory polarities at the phrase and word levels. Most of the current approaches either represent textual data using pre-trained word embeddings without considering the local context that can be extracted from the dataset, or they detect the overall topic polarity without considering both the local and global context. In this paper, we propose a novel document-topic embedding model, DocTopic2Vec, for document-level polarity detection in large texts by employing general and specific contextual cues obtained through the use of document embeddings (Doc2Vec) and Topic Modeling. In our approach, (1) we use a large dataset with game reviews to create different word embeddings by applying Word2Vec, FastText, and GloVe, (2) we create Doc2Vecs enriched with the local context given by the word embeddings for each review, (3) we construct topic embeddings Topic2Vec using three Topic Modeling algorithms, i.e., LDA, NMF, and LSI, to enhance the global context of the Sentiment Analysis task, (4) for each document and its dominant topic, we build the new DocTopic2Vec by concatenating the Doc2Vec with the Topic2Vec created with the same word embedding. We also design six new Convolutional-based (Bidirectional) Recurrent Deep Neural Network Architectures that show promising results for this task. The proposed DocTopic2Vecs are used to benchmark multiple Machine and Deep Learning models, i.e., a Logistic Regression model, used as a baseline, and 18 Deep Neural Networks Architectures. The experimental results show that the new embedding and the new Deep Neural Network Architectures achieve better results than the baseline, i.e., Logistic Regression and Doc2Vec.},

Thus, there is a thriving interest in social impact research, especially from the point of view of its measurement and valuation. In this work, we explored the rising attention on the concept of social impact to identify salient agents in the field and categorize the conceptual structure of research. To achieve this, we used evaluative and relational techniques combining traditional bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and a text mining analysis based on natural processing language (NLP) to search for documents with the term ``social impact'' in the title. The documents were extracted from the database Web of Science (WoS) for the period of 1938--2020. As a result, we mapped the concept of social impact from up to 1677 documents, providing an overview of the topics in which the concept was used (e.g., health, finance, environment and development, etc.) and the trends of research. This work seeks to serve as a roadmap that reflects not only the evolution of social impact but also future lines of research that require attention.},

Countless researchers devoted themselves to rescuing patients and reducing its impact. Analyzing the literature published during the pandemic and identifying the research priorities is of great significance to quickly discover research gaps, rationally allocate scientific research resources, and promote the development of the global research platform. To understand the swing of research priorities during the pandemic, this paper proposed a research priorities identification framework for pandemic based on scientific literature text analysis. Moreover, a research priority metric model was proposed to measure the characteristics of research priorities, and the empirical analysis from COVID-19 scientific literature was conducted to identify the research priorities during the pandemic. As a result, the research priorities identified by the method proposed in this paper discovered the fine-grained dynamic characteristics along with the process in the pandemic outbreak, and based on this, the emergency scientific research response strategies were discussed to give implications for the public health emergency scientific research and management.},

@article{vasquez_henriquez_2020_tweets_on_the_go_gender_differences_in_transport_perception_and_its_discussion_on_social_media,
	abstract = {People often base their mobility decisions on subjective aspects of travel experience, such as time perception, space usage, and safety. It is well recognized that different groups within a population will react differently to the same trip, however, current data collection methods might not consider the multi dimensional aspects of travel perception, which could lead to overlooking the needs of large population groups. In this paper, we propose to measure several aspects of the travel experience from the social media platform Twitter, with a focus on differences with respect to gender. We analyzed more than 400,000 tweets from 100,000 users about transportation from Santiago, Chile. Our main findings show that both genders express themselves differently, as women write about their emotions regarding travel (both, positive and negative feelings), that men express themselves using slang, making it difficult to interpret emotion. The strongest difference is related to harassment, not only on transportation, but also on the public space. Since these aspects are usually omitted from travel surveys, our work provides evidence on how Twitter allows the measurement of aspects of the transportation system in a city that have been studied in qualitative terms, complementing surveys with emotional and safety aspects that are as relevant as those traditionally measured.},

@article{luo_2021_exploring_destination_image_through_online_reviews_an_augmented_mining_model_using_latent_dirichlet_allocation_combined_with_probabilistic_hesitant_fuzzy_algorithm,
	abstract = {Purpose
              In the era of information overload, the density of tourism information and the increasingly sophisticated information needs of consumers have created information confusion for tourists and scenic-area managers. The study aims to help scenic-area managers determine the strengths and weaknesses in the development process of scenic areas and to solve the practical problem of tourists' difficulty in quickly and accurately obtaining the destination image of a scenic area and finding a scenic area that meets their needs.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The study uses a variety of machine learning methods, namely, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) theme extraction model, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting method and sentiment analysis. This work also incorporates probabilistic hesitant fuzzy algorithm (PHFA) in multi-attribute decision-making to form an enhanced tourism destination image mining and analysis model based on visitor expression information. The model is intended to help managers and visitors identify the strengths and weaknesses in the development of scenic areas. Jiuzhaigou is used as an example for empirical analysis.
            
            
              Findings
              In the study, a complete model for the mining analysis of tourism destination image was constructed, and 24,222 online reviews on Jiuzhaigou, China were analyzed in text. The results revealed a total of 10 attributes and 100 attribute elements. From the identified attributes, three negative attributes were identified, namely, crowdedness, tourism cost and accommodation environment. The study provides suggestions for tourists to select attractions and offers recommendations and improvement measures for Jiuzhaigou in terms of crowd control and post-disaster reconstruction.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Previous research in this area has used small sample data for qualitative analysis. Thus, the current study fills this gap in the literature by proposing a machine learning method that incorporates PHFA through the combination of the ideas of management and multi-attribute decision theory. In addition, the study considers visitors' emotions and thematic preferences from the perspective of their expressed information, based on which the tourism destination image is analyzed. Optimization strategies are provided to help managers of scenic spots in their decision-making.},

@article{monselise_2021_topics_and_sentiments_of_public_concerns_regarding_covid_19_vaccines_social_media_trend_analysis,
	abstract = {Background
              As a number of vaccines for COVID-19 are given emergency use authorization by local health agencies and are being administered in multiple countries, it is crucial to gain public trust in these vaccines to ensure herd immunity through vaccination. One way to gauge public sentiment regarding vaccines for the goal of increasing vaccination rates is by analyzing social media such as Twitter.
            
            
              Objective
              The goal of this research was to understand public sentiment toward COVID-19 vaccines by analyzing discussions about the vaccines on social media for a period of 60 days when the vaccines were started in the United States. Using the combination of topic detection and sentiment analysis, we identified different types of concerns regarding vaccines that were expressed by different groups of the public on social media.
            
            
              Methods
              To better understand public sentiment, we collected tweets for exactly 60 days starting from December 16, 2020 that contained hashtags or keywords related to COVID-19 vaccines. We detected and analyzed different topics of discussion of these tweets as well as their emotional content. Vaccine topics were identified by nonnegative matrix factorization, and emotional content was identified using the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner sentiment analysis library as well as by using sentence bidirectional encoder representations from transformer embeddings and comparing the embedding to different emotions using cosine similarity.
            
            
              Results
              After removing all duplicates and retweets, 7,948,886 tweets were collected during the 60-day time period. Topic modeling resulted in 50 topics; of those, we selected 12 topics with the highest volume of tweets for analysis. Administration and access to vaccines were some of the major concerns of the public. Additionally, we classified the tweets in each topic into 1 of the 5 emotions and found fear to be the leading emotion in the tweets, followed by joy.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This research focused not only on negative emotions that may have led to vaccine hesitancy but also on positive emotions toward the vaccine. By identifying both positive and negative emotions, we were able to identify the public's response to the vaccines overall and to news events related to the vaccines. These results are useful for developing plans for disseminating authoritative health information and for better communication to build understanding and trust.},

@article{lee_2021_construction_disputes_and_associated_contractual_knowledge_discovery_using_unstructured_text_heavy_data_legal_cases_in_the_united_kingdom,
	abstract = {Construction disputes are one of the main challenges to successful construction projects. Most construction parties experience claims---and even worse, disputes---which are costly and time-consuming to resolve. Lessons learned from past failure cases can help reduce potential future risk factors that likely lead to disputes. In particular, case law, which has been accumulated from the past, is valuable information, providing useful insights to prepare for future disputes. However, few efforts have been made to discover legal knowledge using a large scale of case laws in the construction field. The aim of this paper is to enhance understanding of the multifaceted legal issues surrounding construction adjudication using large amounts of accumulated construction legal cases. This goal is achieved by exploring dispute-related contract terms and conditions that affect judicial decisions based on their verdicts. This study builds on text mining methods to examine what type of contract conditions are frequently referenced in the final decision of each dispute. Various text mining techniques are leveraged for knowledge discovery (i.e., analyzing frequent terms, discovering pairwise correlations, and identifying potential topics) in text-heavy data. The findings show that (1) similar patterns of disputes have occurred repeatedly in construction-related legal cases and (2) the discovered dispute topics indicate that mutually agreed upon contract terms and conditions are import in dispute resolution.},

@article{ye_2021_cdcn_a_new_nmf_based_community_detection_method_with_community_structures_and_node_attributes,
	abstract = {Community discovery can discover the community structure in a network, and it provides consumers with personalized services and information pushing. It plays an important role in promoting the intelligence of the network society. Most community networks have a community structure whose vertices are gathered into groups which is significant for network data mining and identification. Existing community detection methods explore the original network topology, but they do not make the full use of the inherent semantic information on nodes, e.g., node attributes. To solve the problem, we explore networks by considering both the original network topology and inherent community structures. In this paper, we propose a novel nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model that is divided into two parts, the community structure matrix and the node attribute matrix, and we present a matrix updating method to deal with the nonnegative matrix factorization optimization problem. NMF can achieve large-scale multidimensional data reduction processing to discover the internal relationships between networks and find the degree of network association. The community structure matrix that we proposed provides more information about the network structure by considering the relationships between nodes that connect directly or share similar neighboring nodes. The use of node attributes provides a semantic interpretation for the community structure. We conduct experiments on attributed graph datasets with overlapping and nonoverlapping communities. The results of the experiments show that the performances of the F1-Score and Jaccard-Similarity in the overlapping community and the performances of normalized mutual information (NMI) and accuracy (AC) in the nonoverlapping community are significantly improved. Our proposed model achieves significant improvements in terms of its accuracy and relevance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {The social sciences and digital humanities have recently adopted the machine learning technique of topic modeling to address research questions in their fields. This is problematic in a number of ways, some of which have not received much attention in the debate yet. This paper adds epistemological concerns centering around the interface between topic modeling and linguistic concepts and the argumentative embedding of evidence obtained through topic modeling. It concludes that topic modeling in its present state of methodological integration does not meet the requirements of an independent research method. It operates from relevantly unrealistic assumptions, is non-deterministic, cannot effectively be validated against a reasonable number of competing models, does not lock into a well-defined linguistic interface, and does not scholarly model topics in the sense of themes or content. These features are intrinsic and make the interpretation of its results prone to apophenia (the human tendency to perceive random sets of elements as meaningful patterns) and confirmation bias (the human tendency to perceptually prefer patterns that are in alignment with pre-existing biases). While partial validation of the statistical model is possible, a conceptual validation would require an extended triangulation with other methods and human ratings, and clarification of whether statistical distinctivity of lexical co-occurrence correlates with conceputal topics in any reliable way.},

@techreport{monselise_2021_topics_and_sentiments_of_public_concerns_regarding_covid_19_vaccines_social_media_trend_analysis_preprint,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND
            As a number of vaccines for COVID-19 are given emergency use authorization by local health agencies and are being administered in multiple countries, it is crucial to gain public trust in these vaccines to ensure herd immunity through vaccination. One way to gauge public sentiment regarding vaccines for the goal of increasing vaccination rates is by analyzing social media such as Twitter.
          
          
            OBJECTIVE
            The goal of this research was to understand public sentiment toward COVID-19 vaccines by analyzing discussions about the vaccines on social media for a period of 60 days when the vaccines were started in the United States. Using the combination of topic detection and sentiment analysis, we identified different types of concerns regarding vaccines that were expressed by different groups of the public on social media.
          
          
            METHODS
            To better understand public sentiment, we collected tweets for exactly 60 days starting from December 16, 2020 that contained hashtags or keywords related to COVID-19 vaccines. We detected and analyzed different topics of discussion of these tweets as well as their emotional content. Vaccine topics were identified by nonnegative matrix factorization, and emotional content was identified using the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner sentiment analysis library as well as by using sentence bidirectional encoder representations from transformer embeddings and comparing the embedding to different emotions using cosine similarity.
          
          
            RESULTS
            After removing all duplicates and retweets, 7,948,886 tweets were collected during the 60-day time period. Topic modeling resulted in 50 topics; of those, we selected 12 topics with the highest volume of tweets for analysis. Administration and access to vaccines were some of the major concerns of the public. Additionally, we classified the tweets in each topic into 1 of the 5 emotions and found fear to be the leading emotion in the tweets, followed by joy.
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS
            This research focused not only on negative emotions that may have led to vaccine hesitancy but also on positive emotions toward the vaccine. By identifying both positive and negative emotions, we were able to identify the public's response to the vaccines overall and to news events related to the vaccines. These results are useful for developing plans for disseminating authoritative health information and for better communication to build understanding and trust.},

@article{petrusevich_2019_analysis_of_students_final_qualification_theses_using_text_loans_detection_systems,
	abstract = {In this paper there are results of the bachelor and master theses citing analysis. These students graduated from the Higher mathematics chair of the Russian Technological University in the summer of 2018. In this comparative analysis the dependencies of thesis loan percent on parameters of students, statistical values of their theses are explored. This research is actual because of the progress and development of new informational technologies used in the educational system. Popularity of the text loan detection systems increases. Automatic plagiarism detection systems are intended to make educational process better, the text drawing search easier, to support the copyright laws and academical honesty. The percentage is given by two main Russian plagiarism detection systems: Antiplagiat and Rucontext. Connections between thesis parameters are explored. Advantages of each text loan detection systems are described. In this research there are the results of the pedagogical experiment aimed to analyze statistically the dependencies of the bachelor's and master's theses loan percentage which have been got from Antiplagiat and Rucontext systems on the author's parameters, statistical values describing thesis text. The comparison between statistical results of these systems have been made. The conclusions about their advantages have been presented in the paper. In order to make the comparison methods of the mathematical statistics have been used. Numerical experiment has been provided by means of the packages of the R statistical language. The difference between text loan percentages in the Antiplagiat and Rucontext systems has been analyzed. It has been shown that it grows when length of the text becomes larger. The dependencies of the text loan percentage on the available parameters of the thesis author and text parameters have been presented. The dependencies types are the same for the both systems. Scale of the coefficients in the statistical dependencies is also the same. The difference is in the very set of the parameters: the Rucontext percentage is better described statistically with the sex of the author, the Antiplagiat percentage is described with the type of the higher education (bachelor's or master's thesis). Also the dependency of the text loan percentage on the length of the thesis text differs: the Antiplagiat percentage is better described statistically with the number of words but the Rucontext percentage is described with the number of characters. It seems that these differences can be explained with different text search and analyze algorithms. The dependencies between the Rucontext percentage and the Antiplagiat text loan percentage is presented.},
