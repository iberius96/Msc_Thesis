@article{ghafouri_influence_2022,
	abstract = {A social network (SN) is a social structure consisting of a group representing the interaction between them. SNs have recently been widely used and, subsequently, have become suitable and popular platforms for product promotion and information diffusion. People in an SN directly influence each other's interests and behavior. One of the most important problems in SNs is to find people who can have the maximum influence on other nodes in the network in a cascade manner if they are chosen as the seed nodes of a network diffusion scenario. Influential diffusers are people who, if they are chosen as the seed set in a publishing issue in the network, that network will have the most people who have learned about that diffused entity. This is a well-known problem in literature known as influence maximization (IM) problem. Although it has been proven that this is an NP-complete problem and does not have a solution in polynomial time, it has been argued that it has the properties of sub modular functions and, therefore, can be solved using a greedy algorithm. Most of the methods proposed to improve this complexity are based on the assumption that the entire graph is visible. However, this assumption does not hold for many real-world graphs. This study is conducted to extend current maximization methods with link prediction techniques to pseudo-visibility graphs. To this end, a graph generation method called the exponential random graph model (ERGM) is used for link prediction. The proposed method is tested using the data from the Snap dataset of Stanford University. According to the experimental tests, the proposed method is efficient on real-world graphs.},

	abstract = {This study explores the factors contributing to online users' network centrality in a network on Twitter in the context of a social movement about the ``clear the shelters'' campaign across the United States. The authors performed a social network analysis on a network including 13,270 Twitter users and 24,354 relationships to reveal users' betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, in-degree, and out-degree centralities before hypothesis testing. They applied a path analysis including users' centrality measures and their user-related features. The path analysis discovered that the factors of the number of people a user follows, the number of followers a user has, and the number of years since a user had his account increased a user's in-degree connections in the network. Together with the user's out-degree connections along with in-degree links, they pushed a user to have a strategic place in the network. They also implemented a multi-group analysis to find whether the impact of these factors showed differences specifically in replies to, mentions, and retweets networks.},

@article{firdaniza_information_2021,
	abstract = {Information diffusion, information spread, and influencers are important concepts in many studies on social media, especially Twitter analytics. However, literature overviews on the information diffusion of Twitter analytics are sparse, especially on the use of continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). This paper examines the following topics: (1) the purposes of studies about information diffusion on Twitter, (2) the methods adopted to model information diffusion on Twitter, (3) the metrics applied, and (4) measures used to determine influencer rankings. We employed a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore the studies related to information diffusion on Twitter extracted from four digital libraries. In this paper, a two-stage analysis was conducted. First, we implemented a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and R-bibliometrix software. This approach was applied to select 204 papers after conducting a duplication check and assessing the inclusion--exclusion criteria. At this stage, we mapped the authors' collaborative networks/collaborators and the evolution of research themes. Second, we analyzed the gap in research themes on the application of CTMC information diffusion on Twitter. Further filtering criteria were applied, and 34 papers were analyzed to identify the research objectives, methods, metrics, and measures used by each researcher. Nonhomogeneous CTMC has never been used in Twitter information diffusion modeling. This finding motivates us to further study nonhomogeneous CTMC as a modeling approach for Twitter information diffusion.},

@article{elbaghazaoui_data_2022,
	abstract = {Because of the numerous applications domains in which social media networks can be used, the huge volume of data and information uploaded by them is gaining significant interest. Publishing allows consumers to express their thoughts on products and services. Some feedbacks could also influence other users on those things. Therefore, extracting and identifying influencers from social media networks, also profiling their product perceptions and preferences, is critical for marketers to use efficient viral marketing and recommendation strategies. Our major goal in this research is to find the best machine learning model for characterizing influencers on social media networks. However, to achieve this objective, our strategy revolves around applying the PageRank algorithm to profile influential nodes throughout the social media network graph. The results of our experiment showed that the correlation is always different when adding a new parameter to machine learning models, also to determine the suitable model for our needs. In any event, the experiment outcomes are critical and significant to profiling influencers from social media platforms.},

@article{tidke_social_2021,
	abstract = {Purpose
              In online social network analysis, the problem of identification and ranking of influential nodes based on their prominence has attracted immense attention from researchers and practitioners. Identification and ranking of influential nodes is a challenging problem using Twitter, as data contains heterogeneous features such as tweets, likes, mentions and retweets. The purpose of this paper is to perform correlation between various features, evaluation metrics, approaches and results to validate selection of features as well as results. In addition, the paper uses well-known techniques to find topical authority and sentiments of influential nodes that help smart city governance and to make importance decisions while understanding the various perceptions of relevant influential nodes.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The tweets fetched using Twitter API are stored in Neo4j to generate graph-based relationships between various features of Twitter data such as followers, mentions and retweets. In this paper, consensus approach based on Twitter data using heterogeneous features has been proposed based on various features such as like, mentions and retweets to generate individual list of top-k influential nodes based on each features.
            
            
              Findings
              The heterogeneous features are meant for integrating to accomplish identification and ranking tasks with low computational complexity, i.e. O(n), which is suitable for large-scale online social network with better accuracy than baselines.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Identified influential nodes can act as source in making public decisions and their opinion give insights to urban governance bodies such as municipal corporation as well as similar organization responsible for smart urban governance and smart city development.},

Mixed-methods exploratory analysis was used to evaluate the discourse on Twitter regarding gifted education. The results of the quantitative analysis of the matrix of connections using NodeXL Pro indicate that gifted education Twitter is a cohesive network and that the top influencers are organizations and educational consultants. Sentiment analysis using Linguistics Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC2015, Pennebaker et al., 2015) software indicates that tweets related to gifted education have a mix of positive and negative emotive tone. The qualitative analyses suggest that gifted education professionals and parents engage in Twitter in similar ways to what has been described in past research: to share interesting articles and videos, to discuss current issues, promote one's ideas, and seek opportunities.},

@article{fikriyah_identify_2022,
	abstract = {Twitter is a social media where users often get information from various fields. There are many problems with Twitter. For example, in Indonesia's political field, discussing the performance of the President of Indonesia and his staff who are not good, students and the public hold demonstrations in DKI Jakarta. They want the President of Indonesia to step down from office. When the problem is trending, some users have positive (praise) and negative (blasphemous) behavior, which is interesting to discuss in this study. Before the method stage, data preprocessing is carried out so that the data to be used becomes more efficient. Word weighting is also done using the TF-IDF Vectorizer. Then, the clustering method with the Mean Shift algorithm is applied to identify user behavior based on the type of tweet. This method can find information from a vast data set in a short time. Based on this algorithm, the results obtained are 67 clusters from the Mean Shift algorithm. From a total of 67 clusters obtained, 5 clusters were taken to identify user behavior. User behavior in clusters 0, 2, 3, and 4 is negative because it discusses the people who want the President of the Republic of Indonesia to resign from his position immediately. Meanwhile, user behavior in cluster 1 is positive because the topics discussed only information that the people of Lampung are already in Jakarta.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Quantifying the nodal spreading abilities and identifying the potential influential spreaders has been one of the most engaging topics recently, which is essential and beneficial to facilitate information flow and ensure the stabilization operations of social networks. However, most of the existing algorithms just consider a fundamental quantification through combining a certain attribute of the nodes to measure the nodes' importance. Moreover, reaching a balance between the accuracy and the simplicity of these algorithms is difficult. In order to accurately identify the potential super-spreaders, the CumulativeRank algorithm is proposed in the present study. This algorithm combines the local and global performances of nodes for measuring the nodal spreading abilities. In local performances, the proposed algorithm considers both the direct influence from the node's neighbourhoods and the indirect influence from the nearest and the next nearest neighbours. On the other hand, in the global performances, the concept of the tenacity is introduced to assess the node's prominent position in maintaining the network connectivity. Extensive experiments carried out with the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model on real-world social networks demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the comparison of the proposed algorithm with the existing well-known algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm has lower time complexity and can be applicable to large-scale networks.},

@article{abhishek_mapping_2021,
	abstract = {Purpose
              The advent of social media has led to the emergence of influencers and the domain of influencer marketing (IM). Despite being a popular and evolving research domain, it still lacks a comprehensive and systematic bibliometric analysis in the field. This study attempts to fill this critical gap by mapping the influence of IM to understand the intellectual structure and propose a future research agenda for scholars working in the domain.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The authors have used VOSviewer and Biblioshiny packages for conducting a variety of analyses such as citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, keyword analysis and three-field plot analysis.
            
            
              Findings
              The main findings include identifying six clusters in the domain, i.e. ``mechanism of IM,'' ``measuring the impact of IM,'' ``persuasive cues in IM,'' ``likability factors of influencers,'' ``authenticity of influencers'' and ``understanding followers.'' Future research guidelines have been proposed in each of the six clusters, followed by research and managerial implications, conclusion and limitations.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study is probably the first attempt at providing a comprehensive bibliometric analysis in the domain using a combination of VOSviewer and Biblioshiny packages.},

	abstract = {Social networks are known for their decentralization and democracy. Each individual has a chance to participate and influence any discussion. Even with all the freedom, people's behavior falls under patterns that are observed in numerous situations. In this paper, we propose a methodology that defines and searches for common communication patterns in topical networks on Twitter. We analyze clusters according to four traits: number of nodes the cluster has, their degree and betweenness centrality values, number of node types, and whether the cluster is open or closed. We find that cluster structures can be defined as (a) fixed, meaning that they are repeated across datasets/topics following uniform rules, or (b) variable if they follow an underlying rule regardless of their size. This approach allows us to classify 90\% of all conversation clusters, with the number varying by topic. An increase in cluster size often results in difficulties finding topological shape rules; however, these types of clusters tend to exhibit rules regarding their node relationships in the form of centralization. Most individuals do not enter large-scale discussions on Twitter, meaning that the simplicity of communication clusters implies repetition. In general, power laws apply for the influencer connection distribution (degree centrality) even in topical networks.},

@article{zhang_assessing_2021,
	abstract = {Assessing the structural vulnerability of online social networks has been one of the most engaging topics recently, which is quite essential and beneficial to holding the network connectivity and facilitating information flow, but most of the existing vulnerability assessment measures and the corresponding solutions fail to accurately reveal the global damage done to the network. In order to accurately measure the vulnerability of networks, an invulnerability index based on the concept of improved tenacity is proposed in the present study. Compared with existing measurements, the new method does not measure a single property performance, such as giant component size or the number of components after destruction, but pays special attention to the potential equilibrium between the removal cost and the removal effect. Extensive experiments on real-world social networks demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, compared with results of attacks based on the different centrality indices, we found an individual node's prominence in a network is inherently related to the structural properties of network. In high centralized networks, the nodes with higher eigenvector are more important than the others in maintaining stability and connectivity. But in low centralized networks, the nodes with higher betweenness are more powerful than the others. In addition, the experimental results indicate that low centralized networks can tolerate high intentional attacks and has a better adaptability to attacks than high centralized networks.},

@article{weninggalih_identify_2022,
	abstract = {Information dissemination can occur through any media, including social media. One of the social media that has become a forum for disseminating information is Twitter. Through user-uploaded tweets, not a few comments are positive (praise/support) or negative (blasphemy), depending on the tweet. This study chooses politics as a discussion. Data crawling was carried out to obtain a dataset and raise the topic of Joko Widodo as a President of Indonesia, whose work is considered poor by the public, so they want him to resign immediately. This makes it interesting because we can identify user behavior from tweets about the topic. The choice of this topic was based on a lot of users who discussed it, so it was trending on Twitter. Preprocessing stage aims to eliminate missing values. After that, it then goes through the feature extraction process. The agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm of the clustering method is applied in this research. This algorithm can directly set how many clusters to facilitate the clustering process. The result obtained 3 clusters with different user behavior. Negative user behavior is found in cluster 1, while positive user behavior is found in cluster 2.},

The results identify three categories of accounts that linked Omar to clusters of accounts that shaped the Islamophobia/xenophobic narrative: Influencers, Amplifiers, and Icons. This cadre of accounts played a synergistic and disproportionate role in raising the level of hate speech as a vast network containing a high proportion of apparently inauthentic accounts magnified the messages generated by a handful of provocateurs.},

@article{kanavos_estimating_2019,
	abstract = {A considerable part of social network analysis literature is dedicated to determining which individuals are to be considered as influential in particular social settings. Concretely, Social Influence can be described as the power or even the ability of a person to yet influence the thoughts as well as the actions of other users. So, User Influence stands as a value that depends on the interest of the followers of a concrete user (via retweets, replies, mentions, favorites, etc.). This paper focuses on identifying such phenomena on the Twitter graph and on presenting a novel methodology for characterizing Twitter Influential Users. The novelty of our approach lies in the fact that we have incorporated a set of features for characterizing social media authors, including both nodal and topical metrics, along with new features concerning temporal aspects of user participation on the topic. We have also implemented cluster-based fusion techniques in order to retrieve result lists for the ranking of top influential users. Hence, results show that the proposed implementations and methodology can assist in identifying influential users, that play a dominant role in information diffusion.},

	abstract = {In the contemporary globalised markets opinion leaders play a vital role in the process of the purchasing decision-making of consumers. Thanks to their individual skills, specific knowledge or their personality, opinion leaders have a direct or indirect influence on the attitudes and decisions of consumers. In the contemporary globalised marketing using social media, this role is taken over by the influencers who affect consumers with their thoughts, attitudes and opinions and thus, significantly influence trends in demand for particular products. Over the recent years, influencer marketing has become increasingly popular, representing a specific type of social media marketing. The aim of this scientific contribution is the systematization of knowledge about the position and roles of influencers as opinion leaders in the social media environment in order to identify their typology, influence factors and the intensity of their impact on consumer decision making process, based on the comparison of knowledge from the results of global research studies and the quantitative online research study processed by authors. The findings of the survey showed that the promotion of some products through influencers may be more advantageous than others. Influencers will have the greatest impact when buying clothes, shoes, cosmetics and, surprisingly, services. Meanwhile, people rely heavily on other factors to buy food, jewellery and electronics, but it is not excluded that influencer marketing could affect them as well.},
