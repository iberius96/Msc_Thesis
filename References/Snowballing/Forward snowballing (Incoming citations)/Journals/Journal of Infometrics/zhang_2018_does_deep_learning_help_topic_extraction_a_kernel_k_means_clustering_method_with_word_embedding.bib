@article{zhang_2022_stepping_beyond_your_comfort_zone_diffusion_based_network_analytics_for_knowledge_trajectory_recommendation,
	abstract = {Interest in tracing the research interests of scientific researchers is rising, and particularly that of predicting a researcher's knowledge trajectories beyond their current foci into potential inter-/cross-/multi-disciplinary interactions. Hence, in this study, we present a method of diffusion-based network analytics for knowledge trajectory recommendation. The method begins by constructing a heterogeneous bibliometric network consisting of a co-topic layer and a co-authorship layer. A novel link prediction approach with a diffusion strategy is then used to reflect real-world academic activity, such as knowledge sharing between co-authors or diffusing between similar research topics. This strategy differentiates the interactions occurring between homogeneous and heterogeneous nodes and weights the strengths of these interactions. Two sets of experiments - one with a local dataset and another with a global dataset - demonstrate that the proposed method is prior to selected baselines. In addition, to further examine the reliability of our method, we conducted a case study on recommending knowledge trajectories of selected information scientists and their research groups. The results demonstrate the empirical insights our method yields for individual researchers, communities, and research institutions in the information science discipline.},

@article{shen_2022_english_teaching_ability_evaluation_algorithm_based_on_random_matrix_model_and_fuzzy_k_means_clustering,
	abstract = {This paper proposes a nonelliptic extended English teaching ability evaluation algorithm based on an adaptive random matrix model. The algorithm models a nonelliptical expansion target as multiple elliptical sub-objectives, and the expansion state of each sub-target is described by an inverse Wishart distribution. The new method is combined to improve the robustness problem caused by the initialization after the algorithm expansion. This research uses the smart teacher education platform to conduct research and analysis on the evaluation of teaching practice ability of intern normal students. From the perspective of data evaluation, we explore the influence of normal students' curriculum training on the teaching practice ability of normal students. By analyzing the correlation between normal students' course grades and practice grades, this paper explores the influence of normal students' prepractice training on normal students' teaching practice ability. This paper explores the influence of the training of normal students' course learning on the teaching practice ability of normal students. The results show that the learning level of normal students' professional courses has a significant impact on the development of normal students' practice performance and teaching practice ability; the impact of normal students' pedagogical course level on normal students' practice performance and teaching practice ability is relatively low.},

@article{zhao_2022_intellectual_structure_of_information_science_2011__2020_an_author_co_citation_analysis,
	abstract = {Purpose
              This study continues a long history of author co-citation analysis of the intellectual structure of information science into the time period of 2011--2020. It also examines changes in this structure from 2006--2010 through 2011--2015 to 2016--2020. Results will contribute to a better understanding of the information science research field.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The well-established procedures and techniques for author co-citation analysis were followed. Full records of research articles in core information science journals published during 2011--2020 were retrieved and downloaded from the Web of Science database. About 150 most highly cited authors in each of the two five-year time periods were selected from this dataset to represent this field, and their co-citation counts were calculated. Each co-citation matrix was input into SPSS for factor analysis, and results were visualized in Pajek. Factors were interpreted as specialties and labeled upon an examination of articles written by authors who load primarily on each factor.
            
            
              Findings
              The two-camp structure of information science continued to be present clearly. Bibliometric indicators for research evaluation dominated the Knowledge Domain Analysis camp during both fivr-year time periods, whereas interactive information retrieval (IR) dominated the IR camp during 2011--2015 but shared dominance with information behavior during 2016--2020. Bridging between the two camps became increasingly weaker and was only provided by the scholarly communication specialty during 2016--2020. The IR systems specialty drifted further away from the IR camp. The information behavior specialty experienced a deep slump during 2011--2020 in its evolution process. Altmetrics grew to dominate the Webometrics specialty and brought it to a sharp increase during 2016--2020.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Author co-citation analysis (ACA) is effective in revealing intellectual structures of research fields. Most related studies used term-based methods to identify individual research topics but did not examine the interrelationships between these topics or the overall structure of the field. The few studies that did discuss the overall structure paid little attention to the effect of changes to the source journals on the results. The present study does not have these problems and continues the long history of benchmark contributions to a better understanding of the information science field using ACA.},

@article{salatino_2022_cso_classifier_30_a_scalable_unsupervised_method_for_classifying_documents_in_terms_of_research_topics,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Classifying scientific articles, patents, and other documents according to the relevant research topics is an important task, which enables a variety of functionalities, such as categorising documents in digital libraries, monitoring and predicting research trends, and recommending papers relevant to one or more topics. In this paper, we present the latest version of the CSO Classifier (v3.0), an unsupervised approach for automatically classifying research papers according to the Computer Science Ontology (CSO), a comprehensive taxonomy of research areas in the field of Computer Science. The CSO Classifier takes as input the textual components of a research paper (usually title, abstract, and keywords) and returns a set of research topics drawn from the ontology. This new version includes a new component for discarding outlier topics and offers improved scalability. We evaluated the CSO Classifier on a gold standard of manually annotated articles, demonstrating a significant improvement over alternative methods. We also present an overview of applications adopting the CSO Classifier and describe how it can be adapted to other fields.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Uncovering the driving forces, strategic landscapes, and evolutionary mechanisms of China's research systems is attracting rising interest around the globe. One topic of interest is to understand the problem-solving patterns in China's research systems now and in the future. Targeting a set of high-quality research articles published by Chinese researchers between 2009 and 2018, and indexed in the Essential Science Indicators database, we developed an intelligent bibliometrics-based methodology for identifying the problem-solving patterns from scientific documents. Specifically, science overlay maps incorporating link prediction were used to profile China's disciplinary interactions and predict potential cross-disciplinary innovation at a macro level. We proposed a function incorporating word embedding techniques to represent subjects, actions, and objects (SAO) retrieved from combined titles and abstracts into vectors and constructed a tri-layer SAO network to visualize SAOs and their semantic relationships. Then, at a micro level, we developed network analytics for identifying problems and solutions from the SAO network, and recommending potential solutions for existing problems. Empirical insights derived from this study provide clues to understand China's research strengths and the science policies underlying them, along with the key research problems and solutions that Chinese researchers are focusing on now and might pursue in the future.},

@article{lin_2022_topic_network_analysis_based_on_co_occurrence_time_series_clustering,
	abstract = {Traditional topic research divides similar topics into the same cluster according to clustering or classification from the perspective of users, which ignores the deep relationship within and between topics. In this paper, topic analysis is achieved from the perspective of the topic network. Based on the initial core topics obtained by the keyword importance and affinity propagation clustering, co-occurrence time series between topics are constructed according to time sequence and topic frequency. Subsequence segments of each topic co-occurrence time series are divided by sliding windows, and the similarity between subsequence segments is calculated. Based on the topic similarity matrix, the topic network is constructed. The topic network is divided according to the community detection algorithm, which realizes the topic re-clustering and reveals the deep relationship between topics in fine-grained. The results show there is no relationship between topic center representation and keyword popularity, and topics with a wide range of concepts are more likely to become topic network centers. The proposed approach takes into account the influence of time factors on topic analysis, which not only expands the analysis in the field of topic research but also improves the quality of topic research.},

	abstract = {The wealth of opinions expressed by users on micro-blogging sites can be beneficial for product manufacturers of service providers, as they can gain insights about certain aspects of their products or services. The most common approach for analyzing text opinion is using machine learning. However. opinion data are often imbalanced, e.g. the number of positive sentiments heavily outnumbered the negative sentiments. Ensemble technique, which combines multiple classification algorithms to make decisions, can be used to tackle imbalanced data to learn from multiple balanced datasets. The decision of ensemble is obtained by combining the decisions of individual classifiers using a certain rule. Therefore, rule selection is an important factor in ensemble design. This research aims to investigate the best decision combination rule for imbalanced text data. Multinomial Na{\~A}¯ve Bayes, Complement Na{\~A}¯ve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Softmax Regression are used for base classifiers, and max, min, product, sum, vote, and meta-classifier rules are considered for decision combination. The experiment is done on several Twitter datasets. From the experimental results, it is found that the Softmax Regression ensemble with meta-classifier combination rule performs the best in all except in one dataset. However, it is also found that the training of the Softmax Regression ensemble requires intensive computational resources.},

@article{rustam_2019_the_global_kernel_k_means_clustering_algorithm_for_cerebral_infarction_classification,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Cerebral infarction is the death of neurons, glia cells and blood vessel systems caused by a lack of oxygen and nutrients. This situation is often called storke. Common causes of neuron damage are hypoxia, which is caused by impaired blood flow, reduced oxygen pressure in blood circulation, toxins, and hypoglycemia which can result in the same morphological changes as morphological changes in hypoxia. Hypoxia is reduced oxygen pressure in the alveoli, resulting in hypoxemia which can cause hypoxic brain tissue. The initial stage of ischemic neurons is characterized by the formation of micro vacuolization, which is characterized by the size of the cells that are still normal or slightly reduced, the nucleus shrinks slightly, vacuoles occur in the perikaryon region. This micro vacuole can be found in neurons in hippokamus and cortical 5-15 minutes after hypoxia. The final sign of cell damage due to ischemia is characterized by the nucleus becoming pyknotic and fragmented. To classify cerebral infarction, the author uses the global k-means clustering algorithm as a classification method that shows that the method has good accuracy, good memory, and good precision in classifying cerebral infarction. In this proposed method, the global kernel k-means clustering algorithm is an extension of the standard k-means clustering algorithm and has been used to identify or classify clusters that are non-linearly separated in space input. This method adds one cluster at each stage through a global search process consisting of several k-means kernel executions from the appropriate initialization. Therefore, this method can make good classification accuracy. In particular, this achieves classification accuracy of up to 78\% for the highest accuracy.},

	abstract = {The motorcycle market has experienced an upward trend. That growth brings along mobility, accidents, and environment-related issues; nevertheless, there is a scarcity of literature on evaluating the impact of motorcycle market policies. Consequently, it has been challenging for researchers and policymakers to develop evidence-based strategies to promote or control the growth of this market. This paper aims to review and analyze the scientific literature about motorcycle market policies, using tech-mining techniques and a cluster analysis of keywords, to provide insights about the most relevant world trends in this research area. For this purpose, the bibliographic information of publications in the field was retrieved from the Scopus database. As a result, three thematic clusters (sustainability, mobility, and electric motorcycles) were identified and explained. According to our findings, greenhouse gas emissions, sustainability, environmental impact, and developing countries are the hot research topics. The research leader countries on said topics are the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This study can, therefore, be used as a reference to define a future research agenda in the area. Consequently, it permits researchers and policymakers to identify trending topics and gaps in knowledge, as a baseline to include motorcycles in sustainable and affordable transport systems design.},

@article{xie_2021_a_topic_detection_method_based_on_word_attention_networks,
	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Purpose
              We proposed a method to represent scientific papers by a complex network, which combines the approaches of neural and complex networks.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Its novelty is representing a paper by a word branch, which carries the sequential structure of words in sentences. The branches are generated by the attention mechanism in deep learning models. We connected those branches at the positions of their common words to generate networks, called word-attention networks, and then detect their communities, defined as topics.
            
            
              Findings
              Those detected topics can carry the sequential structure of words in sentences, represent the intra- and inter-sentential dependencies among words, and reveal the roles of words playing in them by network indexes.
            
            
              Research limitations
              The parameter setting of our method may depend on practical data. Thus it needs human experience to find proper settings.
            
            
              Practical implications
              Our method is applied to the papers of the PNAS, where the discipline designations provided by authors are used as the golden labels of papers' topics.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This empirical study shows that the proposed method outperforms the Latent Dirichlet Allocation and is more stable.},

@article{katsurai_2020_using_word_embeddings_for_library_and_information_science_research_a_short_survey,
	abstract = {In the research field of library and information science (LIS), pattern recognition and machine learning approaches have often been adopted to analyze massive amounts of textual data in digital libraries. In recent natural language processing, word embeddings have attracted much attention because they can capture semantic meanings and contexts. This paper presents a short survey of how word embeddings have been used in LIS research, especially focusing on articles published in LIS journals between 2009 and 2019. Our simple bibliographic analysis showed that at least 15 LIS journal papers used word embeddings. These 15 papers were briefly described under the following categories: knowledge extraction and visualization from scholarly data, classification in scholarly data, and others that focus on more general corpora.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Deep learning can be used to forecast emerging technologies based on patent data. However, it requires a large amount of labeled patent data as a training set, which is difficult to obtain due to various constraints. This study proposes a novel approach that integrates data augmentation and deep learning methods, which overcome the problem of lacking training samples when applying deep learning to forecast emerging technologies. First, a sample data set was constructed using Gartner's hype cycle and multiple patent features. Second, a generative adversarial network was used to generate many synthetic samples (data augmentation) to expand the scale of the sample data set. Finally, a deep neural network classifier was trained with the augmented data set to forecast emerging technologies, and it could predict up to 77\% of the emerging technologies in a given year with high precision. This approach was used to forecast emerging technologies in Gartner's hype cycles for 2017 based on patent data from 2000 to 2016. Four out of six of the emerging technologies were forecasted correctly, showing the accuracy and precision of the proposed approach. This approach enables deep learning to forecast emerging technologies with limited training samples.},

@article{amjad_2019_uncovering_diffusion_trends_in_computer_science_and_physics_publications,
	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to trace the knowledge diffusion patterns between the publications of top journals of computer science and physics to uncover the knowledge diffusion trends.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The degree of information flow between the disciplines is a measure of entropy and received citations. The entropy gives the uncertainty in the citation distribution of a journal; the more a journal is involved in spreading information or affected by other journals, its entropy increases. The citations from outside category give the degree of inter-disciplinarity index as the percentage of references made to papers of another discipline. In this study, the topic-related diffusion across computer science and physics scholarly communication network is studied to examine how the same research topic is studied and shared across disciplines.
            
            
              Findings
              For three indicators, Shannon entropy, citations outside category (COC) and research keywords, a global view of information flow at the journal level between both disciplines is obtained. It is observed that computer science mostly cites knowledge published in physics journals as compared to physics journals that cite knowledge within the field.
            
            
              Originality/value
              To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that traces knowledge diffusion trends between computer science and physics publications at journal level using entropy, COC and research keywords.},

@article{wang_2020_a_topic_based_patent_analytics_approach_for_exploring_technological_trends_in_smart_manufacturing,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Smart manufacturing can lead to disruptive changes in production technologies and business models in the manufacturing industry. This paper aims to identify technological topics in smart manufacturing by using patent data, investigating technological trends and exploring potential opportunities.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling technique was used to extract latent technological topics, and the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was used to analyze the relative emergence levels of the topics. Topic value and topic competitive analyses were developed to evaluate each topic's potential value and identify technological positions of competing firms, respectively.
            
            
              Findings
              A total of 14 topics were extracted from the collected patent data and several fast growth and high-value topics were identified, such as smart connection, cyber-physical systems (CPSs), manufacturing data analytics and powder bed fusion additive manufacturing. Several leading firms apply broad R\&D emphasis across a variety of technological topics, while others focus on a few technological topics.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The developed methodology can help firms identify important technological topics in smart manufacturing for making their R\&D investment decisions. Firms can select appropriate technology strategies depending on the topic's emergence position in the topic strategy matrix.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Previous research studies have not analyzed the maturity levels of technological topics. The topic-based patent analytics approach can complement previous studies. In addition, this study provides a multi-valuation framework for exploring technological opportunities, thus providing valuable information that supports a more robust understanding of the technology landscape of smart manufacturing.},
