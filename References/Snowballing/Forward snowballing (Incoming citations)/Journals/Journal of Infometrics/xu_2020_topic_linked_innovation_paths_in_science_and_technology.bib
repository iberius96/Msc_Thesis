	abstract = {Abstract
            Identifying the evolution path of a research field is essential to scientific and technological innovation. There have been many attempts to identify the technology evolution path based on the topic model or social networks analysis, but many of them had deficiencies in methodology. First, many studies have only considered a single type of information (text or citation information) in scientific literature, which may lead to incomplete technology path mapping. Second, the number of topics in each period cannot be determined automatically, making dynamic topic tracking difficult. Third, data mining methods fail to be effectively combined with visual analysis, which will affect the efficiency and flexibility of mapping. In this study, we developed a method for mapping the technology evolution path using a novel non-parametric topic model, the citation involved Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (CIHDP), to achieve better topic detection and tracking of scientific literature. To better present and analyze the path, D3.js is used to visualize the splitting and fusion of the evolutionary path. We used this novel model to mapping the artificial intelligence research domain, through a successful mapping of the evolution path, the proposed method’s validity and merits are shown. After incorporating the citation information, we found that the CIHDP can be mapping a complete path evolution process and had better performance than the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process and LDA. This method can be helpful for understanding and analyzing the development of technical topics. Moreover, it can be well used to map the science or technology of the innovation ecosystem. It may also arouse the interest of technology evolution path researchers or policymakers.},

In this study, taking extant academic publications as our research object, we used topic extraction and visualisation tools to explore the intersections and differences among transformative and other innovative concepts. The correlation degrees among the concepts related to ‘transformative innovation’ were used to distinguish the relationships among concepts related to ‘breakthrough innovation’ and ‘disruptive innovation’. We further analysed the definitional differences among ‘transformative innovation’, ‘emerging technology’ and ‘groundbreaking research’. The results showed that the concepts of ‘breakthrough innovation’ and ‘disruptive innovation’ can be integrated into the scope of ‘transformative innovation’. However, the definitions of ‘transformative innovation’, ‘emerging technology’ and ‘research frontier’ had their distinct characteristics. ‘Transformative innovation’ focused on major impactful technological changes. ‘Emerging technology’ focused on novel technology and its promoting. ‘Research frontier’ focused on research activities taking place at the frontiers of knowledge. Therefore, distinctive science and technology (S\&T) policies are needed for the different types of innovation. This article introduces a novel multidimensional method to place the different concepts associated with ‘transformative innovation’ into a unified framework. This framework is expected to support policymakers in their S\&T policymaking, and it would aid the work of S\&T researchers.},

	abstract = {Objectives
              This paper aimed to identify the technology frontiers of artificial intelligence-assisted pathology based on patent citation network.
            
            
              Methods
              Patents related to artificial intelligence-assisted pathology were searched and collected from the Derwent Innovation Index (DII), which were imported into Derwent Data Analyzer (DDA, Clarivate Derwent, New York, NY, USA) for authority control, and imported into the freely available computer program Ucinet 6 for drawing the patent citation network. The patent citation network according to the citation relationship could describe the technology development context in the field of artificial intelligence-assisted pathology. The patent citations were extracted from the collected patent data, selected highly cited patents to form a co-occurrence matrix, and built a patent citation network based on the co-occurrence matrix in each period. Text clustering is an unsupervised learning method, an important method in text mining, where similar documents are grouped into clusters. The similarity between documents are determined by calculating the distance between them, and the two documents with the closest distance are combined. The method of text clustering was used to identify the technology frontiers based on the patent citation network, which was according to co-word analysis of the title and abstract of the patents in this field.
            
            
              Results
              1704 patents were obtained in the field of artificial intelligence-assisted pathology, which had been currently undergoing three stages, namely the budding period (1992–2000), the development period (2001–2015), and the rapid growth period (2016–2021). There were two technology frontiers in the budding period (1992–2000), namely systems and methods for image data processing in computerized tomography (CT), and immunohistochemistry (IHC), five technology frontiers in the development period (2001–2015), namely spectral analysis methods of biomacromolecules, pathological information system, diagnostic biomarkers, molecular pathology diagnosis, and pathological diagnosis antibody, and six technology frontiers in the rapid growth period (2016–2021), namely digital pathology (DP), deep learning (DL) algorithms—convolutional neural networks (CNN), disease prediction models, computational pathology, pathological image analysis method, and intelligent pathological system.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Artificial intelligence-assisted pathology was currently in a rapid development period, and computational pathology, DL and other technologies in this period all involved the study of algorithms. Future research hotspots in this field would focus on algorithm improvement and intelligent diagnosis in order to realize the precise diagnosis. The results of this study presented an overview of the characteristics of research status and development trends in the field of artificial intelligence-assisted pathology, which could help readers broaden innovative ideas and discover new technological opportunities, and also served as important indicators for government policymaking.},

	abstract = {Investments in research and development (R\&D) and innovation are expensive, and one wishes to be assured that there is positive feedback and to receive guidance on how to direct investments in the future. The social or economic benefits of investments in R\&D are of particular interest to policymakers. In this regard, public expense in research, especially through universities, is sometimes being questioned. This paper establishes a measure of how research in Spain, and specifically in its universities, is involved. In this study, we have analyzed all the literature cited in the period 1998–2018 produced by Spanish institutions and which has been cited in at least one international patent, obtaining more than 40,000 publications from more than 160,000 different authors. The data have been surprisingly positive, showing that practically all public universities contribute to this subject and that there is a great deal of international collaboration, both in terms of the number of countries with which they collaborate and the prestige of the institutions involved. Regarding the specific scientific fields in which this collaboration is most relevant, biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology, and medicine together account for almost 40\% of the total works. The topics most used by these publications were those of diseases or medical problems such as: Neoplams, Carcinoma, Alzheimer Disease, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Oncology was according to the All Science Journal Classification (ASJC) the leading and central issue. Therefore, although the result of basic research is difficult to quantify, when it is observed that there is a return in fields such as medicine or global health, it can be said that it is well employed. In terms of journals from a purely bibliometric point of view, it has been observed that some journals do not have a great impact or relative position within their categories, but they do have a great relevance in this area of patent support. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to set up a rank for scientific journals based on the citations of patents, so the percentage of articles cited in patents with Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) {\textgreater}1, and as an indicator of scientific transfer from universities or research centres, the transference index in patents (TIP) is also proposed.},

In science education, Nature of Science (NOS), in its different forms of educational scaffoldings, seeks to provide with students an understanding of features of scientific knowledge and science in general, how scientific knowledge changes and becomes accepted, and what factors guide scientific activities. For a science teacher, deep and broad enough picture of sciences is therefore of importance. This study attempts to show that the research field called Science of Science (SoS) can significantly support building such a panoramic picture of sciences, and through that, significantly support NOS. The SoS approaches the structure and dynamics of science quantitatively, using scientific documents (e.g., publications, reports, books and monographs and patent applications) as trails to map the landscape of sciences. It is argued here that SoS may provide material and interesting cases for NOS, and in so doing enrich NOS in a similarly significant way as history, philosophy and sociology of science (HPSS) scholarship has done thus far. This study introduces several themes based on SoS that are of relevance for NOS as they were introduced and discussed in a pre-service science teachers’ course. The feedback from pre-service teachers shows that introducing SoS, with minimal additional philosophical interpretations and discussions, but simply as evidential facts and findings, sparks ideas and views that come very close to NOS themes and topics. Discussions related to nature of science, and specific educational NOS scaffoldings for it, can find a good companion in SoS; the latter providing facts and evidence of thee structure and dynamics of sciences, the former providing perspectives for interpretations.},
