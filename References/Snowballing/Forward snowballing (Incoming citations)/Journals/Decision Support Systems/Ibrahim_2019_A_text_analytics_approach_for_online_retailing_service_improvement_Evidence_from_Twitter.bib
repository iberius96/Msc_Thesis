@article{poumay_2021_htmot__hierarchical_topic_modelling_over_time,
	abstract = {Over the years, topic models have provided an efficient way of extracting insights from text. However, while many models have been proposed, none are able to model topic temporality and hierarchy jointly. Modelling time provide more precise topics by separating lexically close but temporally distinct topics while modelling hierarchy provides a more detailed view of the content of a document corpus. In this study, we therefore propose a novel method, HTMOT, to perform Hierarchical Topic Modelling Over Time. We train HTMOT using a new implementation of Gibbs sampling, which is more efficient. Specifically, we show that only applying time modelling to deep sub-topics provides a way to extract specific stories or events while high level topics extract larger themes in the corpus. Our results show that our training procedure is fast and can extract accurate high-level topics and temporally precise sub-topics. We measured our model's performance using the Word Intrusion task and outlined some limitations of this evaluation method, especially for hierarchical models. As a case study, we focused on the various developments in the space industry in 2020.},

	abstract = {The volume of discussions concerning brands within social media provides digital marketers with great opportunities for tracking and analyzing the feelings and views of consumers toward brands, products, influencers, services, and ad campaigns in CGC. The present study aims to assess and compare the performance of firms and celebrities (i.e., influencers that with the experience of being in an ad campaign of those companies) with the automated sentiment analysis that was employed for CGC at social media while exploring the feeling of the consumers toward them to observe which influencer (of two for each company) had a closer effect with the corresponding corporation on consumer minds. For this purpose, several consumer tweets from the pages of brands and influencers were utilized to make a comparison of machine learning and lexicon-based approaches to the sentiment analysis through the Naive algorithm (lexicon-based) and Naive Bayes algorithm (machine learning method) and obtain the desired results to assess the campaigns. The findings suggested that the approaches were dissimilar in terms of accuracy; the machine learning method yielded higher accuracy. Finally, the results showed which influencer was more appropriate according to their existence in previous campaigns and helped choose the right influencer in the future for our company and have a better, more appropriate, and more efficient ad campaign subsequently. It is required to conduct further studies on the accuracy improvement of the sentiment classification. This approach should be employed for other social media CGC types. The results revealed decision-making for which sentiment analysis methods are the best approaches for the analysis of social media. It was also found that companies should be aware of their consumers' sentiments and choose the right person every time they think of a campaign.},

@article{wang_2022_discovery_of_product_features_for_redesign_from_user_implicit_feedback,
	abstract = {Online reviews are key sources to help manufacturers design and improve their products. However, using online reviews for product redesign is challenging because many online reviews contain useless information, and customers rarely provide explicit information about the products. The few methods available to recognize the customers' demands from online reviews have several limitations, including failing to consider the redundancy of useless reviews, confusion in providing targeted information among different aspects of product design, and disregarding the manufacturing limitation. Hence, considering customer needs and manufacturing constraints for product improvement, this study proposes a new model called DPFR to discover the potential product features for redesign. In DPFR, it first analyzes and predicts helpfulness of reviews for more effective decision of product design and improvement, which is neglected in previous research. Then, a structured model based on topic modeling is conducted. Overlooked by previous researchers, DPFR also introduces a feature importance matric to measure the significance of each commented feature to product redesign. Third, a target features selection model is conducted further considering the limitations of manufacturers rather than only focusing on customer satisfaction. The effectiveness of the proposed model was assessed using a case study of data acquired from Bilibili, a large short-video platform in China. Focusing only on customer satisfaction, the results confirm the effectiveness of DPFR. Finally, including the constraints of product redesign, DPFR balances customer satisfaction and the manufacturing constraints such as redesign cost, redesign time, and carbon emissions. This study provides more practical suggestions for manufacturers to discover product redesign features that result in strategic product improvement decisions.},

@article{alanazi_2022_publics_mental_health_monitoring_via_sentimental_analysis_of_financial_text_using_machine_learning_techniques,
	abstract = {Public feelings and reactions associated with finance are gaining significant importance as they help individuals, public health, financial and non-financial institutions, and the government understand mental health, the impact of policies, and counter-response. Every individual sentiment linked with a financial text can be categorized, whether it is a headline or the detailed content published in a newspaper. The Guardian newspaper is considered one of the most famous and the biggest websites for digital media on the internet. Moreover, it can be one of the vital platforms for tracking the public's mental health and feelings via sentimental analysis of news headlines and detailed content related to finance. One of the key purposes of this study is the public's mental health tracking via the sentimental analysis of financial text news primarily published on digital media to identify the overall mental health of the public and the impact of national or international financial policies. A dataset was collected using The Guardian application programming interface and processed using the support vector machine, AdaBoost, and single layer convolutional neural network. Among all identified techniques, the single layer convolutional neural network with a classification accuracy of 0.939 is considered the best during the training and testing phases as it produced efficient performance and effective results compared to other techniques, such as support vector machine and AdaBoost with associated classification accuracies 0.677 and 0.761, respectively. The findings of this research would also benefit public health, as well as financial and non-financial institutions.},

@article{kim_2022_opinion_mining_based_term_extraction_sentiment_classification_modeling,
	abstract = {The spread of social media has accelerated the formation and dissemination of user review data, which contain subjective opinions of users on products, in an e-commerce environment. Because these reviews significantly influence other users, opinion mining has garnered substantial attention in analyzing the positive and negative opinions of users and deriving solutions based on these analytical results. Terms that include sentimental information and used in user reviews serve as the most crucial element in sentimental classification. In this regard, it is crucial to distinguish the most influential terms in user reviews. This study proposed a document-level sentiment classification model based on the collection and application of user reviews generated in an e-commerce environment. Here, a term information extraction method was applied to the proposed model to select core terms, classify the selected terms according to parts of speech (POS), determine terms that can increase information power and influence, and adopt these terms in opinion mining research, based on SVM, SVM+, and SVM+MTL techniques. The results obtained from evaluating the proposed model indicate that it exhibited excellent sentiment analysis performance. The proposed model is expected to be effectively utilized in providing enhanced services for users and increasing competitiveness in the e-commerce environment.},

	abstract = {This study uses aspect level sentiment analysis using lexicon-based approach to analyse online reviews of an Indian brand called Patanjali, which sells many FMCG products under its name. These reviews have been collected from the microblogging site twitter from where a total of 4961 tweets about ten Patanjali branded products have been extracted and analysed. Along with the aspect level sentiment analysis, an opinion tagged corpora has also been developed. Machine learning approaches - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Na{\"\i}ve Bayes have also been used to perform the sentiment analysis and to figure out the appropriate classifiers suitable for such product reviews analysis. Authors first identify customer preferences and / or opinions about a product or brand by analyisng online customer reviews as they express them on social media platform, twitter by using aspect level sentiment analysis. Authors also address the limitations of scarcity of opinion tagged data, required to train supervised classifiers to perform sentiment analysis by developing tagged corpora.},

@article{firdaniza_2021_information_diffusion_model_in_twitter_a_systematic_literature_review,
	abstract = {Information diffusion, information spread, and influencers are important concepts in many studies on social media, especially Twitter analytics. However, literature overviews on the information diffusion of Twitter analytics are sparse, especially on the use of continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). This paper examines the following topics: (1) the purposes of studies about information diffusion on Twitter, (2) the methods adopted to model information diffusion on Twitter, (3) the metrics applied, and (4) measures used to determine influencer rankings. We employed a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore the studies related to information diffusion on Twitter extracted from four digital libraries. In this paper, a two-stage analysis was conducted. First, we implemented a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and R-bibliometrix software. This approach was applied to select 204 papers after conducting a duplication check and assessing the inclusion--exclusion criteria. At this stage, we mapped the authors' collaborative networks/collaborators and the evolution of research themes. Second, we analyzed the gap in research themes on the application of CTMC information diffusion on Twitter. Further filtering criteria were applied, and 34 papers were analyzed to identify the research objectives, methods, metrics, and measures used by each researcher. Nonhomogeneous CTMC has never been used in Twitter information diffusion modeling. This finding motivates us to further study nonhomogeneous CTMC as a modeling approach for Twitter information diffusion.},

@article{schlosser_2021_comparing_methods_to_collect_and_geolocate_tweets_in_great_britain,
	abstract = {In the era of Big Data, the Internet has become one of the main data sources: Data can be collected for relatively low costs and can be used for a wide range of purposes. To be able to timely support solid decisions in any field, it is essential to increase data production efficiency, data accuracy, and reliability. In this framework, our paper aims at identifying an optimized and flexible method to collect and, at the same time, geolocate social media information over a whole country. In particular, the target of this paper is to compare three alternative methods to collect data from the social media Twitter. This is achieved considering four main comparison criteria: Collection time, dataset size, pre-processing phase load, and geographic distribution. Our findings regarding Great Britain identify one of these methods as the best option, since it is able to collect both the highest number of tweets per hour and the highest percentage of unique tweets per hour. Furthermore, this method reduces the computational effort needed to pre-process the collected tweets (e.g., showing the lowest collection times and the lowest number of duplicates within the geographical areas) and enhances the territorial coverage (if compared to the population distribution). At the same time, the effort required to set up this method is feasible and less prone to the arbitrary decisions of the researcher.},

@article{ding_2021_exploring_sources_of_satisfaction_and_dissatisfaction_in_airbnb_accommodation_using_unsupervised_and_supervised_topic_modeling,
	abstract = {This study aims to examine key attributes affecting Airbnb users' satisfaction and dissatisfaction through the analysis of online reviews. A corpus that comprises 59,766 Airbnb reviews form 27,980 listings located in 12 different cities is analyzed by using both Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and supervised LDA (sLDA) approach. Unlike previous LDA based Airbnb studies, this study examines positive and negative Airbnb reviews separately, and results reveal the heterogeneity of satisfaction and dissatisfaction attributes in Airbnb accommodation. In particular, the emergence of the topic ``guest conflicts'' in this study leads to a new direction in future sharing economy accommodation research, which is to study the interactions of different guests in a highly shared environment. The results of topic distribution analysis show that in different types of Airbnb properties, Airbnb users attach different importance to the same service attributes. The topic correlation analysis reveals that home like experience and help from the host are associated with Airbnb users' revisit intention. We determine attributes that have the strongest predictive power to Airbnb users' satisfaction and dissatisfaction through the sLDA analysis, which provides valuable managerial insights into priority setting when developing strategies to increase Airbnb users' satisfaction. Methodologically, this study contributes by illustrating how to employ novel approaches to transform social media data into useful knowledge about customer satisfaction, and the findings can provide valuable managerial implications for Airbnb practitioners.},

This paper proposes a novel approach to acquire useful online reviews from E-commerce platforms, build a product evaluation indicator system, and put forward improvement strategies for the product with opinion mining and sentiment analysis with online reviews. The effectiveness of the method is validated by a large number of user reviews for smartphones wherein, with the evaluation indicator system, we can accurately predict the bad review rate for the product with only 9.9\% error. And improvement strategies are proposed after processing the whole approach in the case study. The approach can be applied for product evaluation and improvement, especially for the products with needs for iterative design and sailed online with plenty of user reviews.},

Due to this fact, this study aims to analyze and characterize the public opinions from the messages posted by Twitter users while addressing customer services. For this purpose, this study carried out a content analysis of a customer service platform. We extracted the general users' viewpoints and sentiments of each of the discussed topics by using a wide range of techniques, such as topic modeling, document clustering, and opinion mining algorithms. For training these systems and drawing conclusions, a dataset containing tweets from the English-speaking customers addressing the @Uber\_Support platform during the year 2020 has been used.},

@article{bansal_2020_aspect_context_aware_sentiment_classification_of_online_consumer_reviews,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Aspect based sentiment classification is valuable for providing deeper insight into online consumer reviews (OCR). However, the majority of the previous studies explicitly determine the orientation of aspect related sentiment bearing word and overlook the aspect-context. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an aspect-context aware sentiment classification of OCR for deeper and more accurate insights.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              In the proposed methodology, first, aspect descriptions and sentiment bearing words are extracted. Then, the skip-gram model is used to extract the first set of features to capture contextual information. For the second category of features, cosine similarity is used between a pre-defined seed word list and aspects, to capture aspect context sensitive sentiments. The third set of features includes weighted word vectors using term frequency-inverse document frequency. After concatenating features, ensemble classifier is used using three base classifiers.
            
            
              Findings
              Experimental results on two real-world data sets with variable lengths, acquired from Amazon.com and TripAdvisor.com, show that the advised ensemble approach significantly outperforms sentiment classification accuracy of state-of-the-art and baseline methods.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This method is capable of capturing the correct sentiment of ambiguous words and other special words by extracting aspect-context using word vector similarity instead of expensive lexical resources, and hence, shows superior performance in terms of accuracy as compared to other methods.},

@article{he_2020_the_voice_of_drug_consumers_online_textual_review_analysis_using_structural_topic_model,
	abstract = {Many web-based pharmaceutical e-commerce platforms allow consumers to post open-ended textual reviews based on their purchase experiences. Understanding the true voice of consumers by analyzing such a large amount of user-generated content is of great significance to pharmaceutical manufacturers and e-commerce websites. The aim of this paper is to automatically extract hidden topics from web-based drug reviews using the structural topic model (STM) to examine consumers' concerns when they buy drugs online. The STM is a probabilistic extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which allows the consolidation of document-level covariates. This innovation allows us to capture consumer dissatisfaction along with their dynamics over time. We extract 12 topics, and five of them are negative topics representing consumer dissatisfaction, whose appearances in the negative reviews are substantially higher than those in the positive reviews. We also come to the conclusion that the prevalence of these five negative topics has not decreased over time. Furthermore, our results reveal that the prevalence of price-related topics has decreased significantly in positive reviews, which indicates that low-price strategies are becoming less attractive to customers. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first study using STM to analyze the unstructured textual data of drug reviews, which enhances the understanding of the aspects of drug consumer concerns and contributes to the research of pharmaceutical e-commerce literature.},

In the digital world, the amount of generated data has increased. According to the research of International Data Corporation (IDC), 33 zettabytes of data were created in 2018, and it is estimated that the amount of data will scale up more than five times from 2018 to 2025. In addition, the advertising sector, healthcare industry, biomedical companies, private firms, and governmental agencies have to make many investments in the collection, aggregation, and sharing of enormous amounts of data. To process this large-scale data, specific data processing techniques are used rather than conventional methodologies. This chapter deals with the concepts, architectures, technologies, and techniques that process big data.},
