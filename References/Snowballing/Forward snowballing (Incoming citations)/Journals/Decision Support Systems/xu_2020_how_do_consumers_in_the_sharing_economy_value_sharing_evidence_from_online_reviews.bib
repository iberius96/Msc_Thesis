	abstract = {In the access to peer-to-peer sharing of goods and services through a technology platform, which is known as the sharing economy, there is no consensus on the factors that motivate consumers. This study aimed to investigate the moderating effect of perceived risk on consumers' participation in the sharing economy in a developing country. Following a quantitative approach, a survey was conducted among 400 consumers in the Metropolitan Zone of Puebla City, Mexico. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the data. Economic benefits, enjoyment, and trust drove the usage behavior of consumers in the sharing economy. In addition, perceived risk significantly moderated the relationships that usage behavior has with the economic benefits and the feeling of the community. As predicted by social exchange theory, the consumers made choices based on a subjective cost--benefit analysis, showing flexibility in the type and amount of rewards. This study contributes to knowledge about customer behavior in the context of the sharing economy.},

@article{chen_2022_cue_congruence_effects_of_attribute_performance_and_hosts_service_quality_attributes_on_room_sales_on_peer_to_peer_accommodation_platforms,
	abstract = {Purpose
              This study aims to explore how attribute performance and hosts' service quality attributes affect room sales on peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms from the cue congruence perspective.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              More than 9.53 million reviews concerning 258,473 listings located in 35 major cities worldwide were collected from Airbnb. Data was collected from December 2019 to December 2020 and was analysed using a generalised linear model.
            
            
              Findings
              Results show that when attribute performance and hosts' service quality attributes give positive signals, Airbnb room sales are significantly higher than when the two kinds of cues give inconsistent or negative signals; when attribute performance gives positive signals and hosts' service quality attributes give negative signals, room sales are higher than when the former gives negative signals and the latter give positive signals; surprisingly, when both kinds of cues give negative signals, room sales are higher than when attribute performance gives positive signals and hosts' service quality attributes give negative signals.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              This paper adds useful insights on understanding of cue congruence (incongruence) effect on room sales of P2P accommodation platforms. This study has practical implications for hosts, online platform managers and guests regarding how to use online strategies and promotions on the Airbnb platform.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study is an early attempt to explore how the combination of attribute performance and hosts' service quality attributes affects Airbnb room sales under the conditions of consistency and inconsistency.},

@article{casidy_2022_customer_brand_engagement_and_co_production_an_examination_of_key_boundary_conditions_in_the_sharing_economy,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Digital platforms have transformed how brands engage with collaborative consumption actors, such as prosumers. This study aims to examine the role of customer innovativeness and perceived economic value as important boundary conditions on the effects of customer brand engagement behavior on co-production, which subsequently influences customer satisfaction.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The authors test the model using survey data from 430 users of a digital platform (i.e. UBER) in Australia. Hypotheses were tested using the bias-corrected bootstrapping method.
            
            
              Findings
              The findings suggest that customer innovativeness and perceived economic value positively moderate the effects of customer brand engagement behavior on co-production. Further, the mediating effects of co-production on satisfaction are stronger for highly innovative customers and for those who associate high perceived economic value with the brand.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              This study provides novel insights on the boundary conditions of the effects of customer brand engagement behavior on co-production. Future research could apply this study's conceptual framework to other digital platforms to extend the generalizability of this framework.
            
            
              Practical implications
              This study provides managerial insights into how firms can customize marketing strategies to encourage customers as prosumers in co-production by targeting highly innovative customers and focusing on perceived economic value.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study builds on service-dominant logic and social exchange theory to examine the role of customer innovativeness and perceived economic value as novel boundary conditions in digital platform ecosystems.},

@article{ruan_2022_working_together_or_separately_the_role_of_different_review_arguments_in_consumers_home_sharing_service_purchasing_evidence_from_china,
	abstract = {Purpose
              This study aims to distinguish between service arguments and communication arguments within a home-sharing review and to investigate their roles in consumer purchase decision-making.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Based on the setting of Airbnb, a 3 (service argument valence: positive, neutral, and negative) × 3 (communication argument valence: positive, neutral, and negative) online experiment was conducted. Data collected from 379 participants were used to test the hypotheses.
            
            
              Findings
              The three main determinants of purchase intention: perceived host service quality, perceived facility service quality, and perceived social value, are affected by both service arguments and communication arguments. Service arguments positively influence perceived host service quality and perceived facility service quality, while communication arguments contribute significantly to perceived host service quality and perceived social value. However, perceived facility service quality is affected by the combination of service arguments and communication arguments rather than by the service arguments only, because service argument trustworthiness, a factor influencing the effect of service arguments, varies across the combination of two types of arguments.
            
            
              Practical implications
              This research helps home-sharing platform managers to understand how to facilitate transaction success through displaying different review arguments needed by consumers. Additionally, the dual role of communication arguments emphasizes a necessity for hosts to encourage positive communication arguments and provide additional cues on the facility service quality.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The service arguments and communication arguments in home-sharing reviews are distinguished, and their distinct roles in consumers' purchase intention have been uncovered.},

@article{manchanda_2022_multi_homing_in_b2b_services_a_psychological_perspective,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Extant literature on business-to-business (B2B) has largely ignored studying multi-homing through a psychological lens. This paper aims to outline the results of three constituent studies, which were designed to reveal potential differences in multi-homers' versus single-homers' loyalty behaviors in a B2B and supply chain management (SCM) setting; identify factors that differentiate single-homers and multi-homers in these settings; and examine the relevance and effect of perceived risk on multi-homing behaviors.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              In Studies 1 and 2, the authors used a questionnaire-based survey to capture the perceptions of 503 and 458 SCM experts, respectively. They then deployed AMOS v.21 to perform structural equation modeling. In Study 3, the authors used a mixed-methods approach to interview 18 SCM experts and then applied these insights to a survey with 242 SCM experts.
            
            
              Findings
              Study 1 reveals that multi-homers' loyalty toward their preferred SP has a weaker effect on willingness to pay premium prices and share-of-wallet than single-homers' loyalty. Study 2 establishes that several attitudinal factors distinguish multi-homers from single-homers in a loyalty framework. Study 3 concludes that perceived risk dimensions promote multi-homing intention, which in turn promotes multi-homing behavior.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Through empirical investigation, the present research succeeds in establishing that multi-homing is a concern for SPs, deciphering the attitudinal factors that distinguish multi-homers and single-homers in a loyalty framework, and confirming the influence of perceived risk dimensions on multi-homing. Thus, the study has several theoretical and practical implications for B2B services in emerging economies.},

Academic literature in this field is analyzed to show the theoretical foundation, important papers, and key themes underlying the field by using various bibliometric analysis tools. We conduct a citation and co-citation analysis on literature concerning big data analytics in sharing economy, which published in the 12-year period from 2010--2021. A total of 205 papers were screened from Web of Science (WoS) database for our analysis. In the citation analysis, we depend on the degree centrality and betweenness centrality to identify 48 important papers. In the co-citation analysis, four major research themes are identified: sustainable business model, efficient match-making, trust building and innovation and value cocreation. The research also highlights future research directions and critical areas for the application of big data analytics in the SE context, which may help to produce in-depth studies.},

@article{lee_2022_what_have_hosts_overlooked_for_improving_stay_experience_in_accommodation_sharing_empirical_evidence_from_airbnb_customer_reviews,
	abstract = {Purpose
              In accommodation-sharing, hosts must provide satisfactory stay experiences for guests, who will then express intentions to revisit (behavioral loyalty) and/or recommend the experiences to others (attitudinal loyalty) in their reviews. Through the lens of expectation-confirmation theory, this study aims to investigate the service dimensions customers focus on in their reviews and their relationships with customer-loyalty manifestations in accommodation-sharing.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study uses topic modeling to discover distinctive dimensions from Airbnb reviews from a micro perspective and map them onto overarching themes from a macro perspective, and further examine the relationships among topics using cluster analysis.
            
            
              Findings
              This study reveals ``information'' as an important theme rarely mentioned in the literature. Besides, ``homeliness'' is a unique dimension associated with behavioral and attitudinal loyalty toward accommodation-sharing.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The findings help accommodation-sharing platforms and hosts identify customer concerns and the drivers of customer loyalty in accommodation-sharing.
            
            
              Originality/value
              In the existing literature, customer perceptions and loyalty are largely determined through surveys, and the findings are not univocal due to the inconsistencies of measurement items used, the potential response bias and limited sample sizes. This study capitalizes on the wealth of user-generated content and extracts service dimensions and customer loyalty directly from textual reviews, overcoming previous research limitations.},

@article{abutaleb_2022_towards_a_consumer_social_behavior_theory_for_sharing_economy_an_integrated_view,
	abstract = {Purpose
              The current study is exploring factors affecting social and sharing behavioral intentions. The paper proposes a new theory, the consumer social behavior theory, which aids in understanding social behaviors. This is through the convergence of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and norm activation theory (NAT) to foster the understanding of sharing and social behaviors. Religiosity, as a cultural and psychological factor, along with five major predictors of sharing practices are also incorporated. These predictors are economic benefits, sustainability, enjoyment, trust and difficulties in sharing practices.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The current study takes a new route through proposing a new theoretical contribution and developing a new theory termed consumer social behavior theory (CSBT) to be commonly used in social behavioral contexts.
            
            
              Findings
              The CSBT is an output of integrating two prominent theories in pro-social and pro-environmental contexts. It is found that integrating both theories help in thoroughly examining behavioral intentions. Religiosity is found to significantly impact intentions towards social behaviors, yet no study examined its role in sharing and social behaviors contexts.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study is contributing to and enriching the sharing economy research domain through new theoretical developments. A theory adaptation for TPB and NAT was conducted to advance a thorough understanding of sharing and social behavioral intentions. This work is considered the first of its kind to develop an integrated view for sharing and social behaviors.},

@article{zhuo_2022_consumer_demand_behavior_mining_and_product_recommendation_based_on_online_product_review_mining_and_fuzzy_sets,
	abstract = {Consumer demand is the need for product characteristics expressed in their own words, which is the basis for producers to develop product recommendations. The extraction and analysis of consumer demands is the most critical input information in quality function deployment (QFD), which has a significant impact on the final prioritization of product technical features, product optimization, and subsequent configuration decisions in QFD, and is directly related to the success of product development. However, the traditional QFD approach to demand analysis lacks reliability and feasibility, and its application often requires time and labor costs that exceed the company's actual capabilities. Therefore, this paper uses online reviews as the data source and constructs a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model based on fuzzy sets to explore the consumer demand information reflected in user reviews. We also introduce the concept of word vector to improve the LDA topic model and compare it with the traditional topic model to verify the performance of the model, so as to explore the consumer demand behavior more accurately and efficiently.},

Drawing on legitimacy and uncertainty reduction theories, we propose a theoretical framework of the antecedents of trust. We develop a survey instrument and collect data to empirically test the research model. The results reveal an association between the legitimacy of the service and customers' trust in the service. Nonetheless, the different types of legitimacy vary in their effect on trust levels. We further show that process transparency positively affects trust in RHS. We discuss our findings and offer valuable theoretical and practical implications to the growing literature on trust in the sharing economy.},

@article{ahmed_2021_passenger_satisfaction_and_loyalty_for_app_based_ride_sharing_services_through_the_tunnel_of_perceived_quality_and_value_for_money,
	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this study is to investigate the passengers' perception of app or application-based ride-sharing service in Bangladesh. The research directly measures the passengers' perception of perceived quality and value for money of using app-based ride-sharing services in Bangladesh and how it impacts passengers' satisfaction. The study also measures the indirect relationship of perceived quality and value for money and passengers' loyalty through the mediating effects of passenger satisfaction in app-based ride-sharing services.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The authors used an online self-administered survey questionnaire to collect data from the respondents who have experienced app-based ride-sharing services in Bangladesh. In this study, 400 questionnaires were distributed to the respondents online (Google form) and received 281 useful responses that give a 70.25\% response rate. The survey data were analyzed based on construct validity, convergent validity and structural equation modeling by using Smart PLS 3.
            
            
              Findings
              The research findings indicate that perceived quality and value for money positively and significantly influence passengers' satisfaction. The passengers' satisfaction has a direct and significant relationship with passenger loyalty. The research findings also indicate that perceived quality and value for money have an indirect relationship with passenger loyalty through the mediating effect of passenger loyalty in app-based ride-sharing services.
            
            
              Practical implications
              Both perceived quality and value for money have been the key drivers of passenger satisfaction and loyalty. Thus, the ride-sharing service providers should emphasize enhancing passenger value perception and quality service to reinforce passenger satisfaction and loyalty by increasing communication with the passengers about their apps. Besides, the service providers need to keep track of passengers' satisfaction levels and adopt necessary initiatives to ensure satisfied passengers toward loyalty.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Limited studies have investigated the impacts of perceived quality and value for money on passenger satisfaction and loyalty to app-based rideshare service. It is a suitable time as the research findings will help ride-sharing service providers enhance their quality performance to compete healthily. Simultaneously, passengers can enjoy improved, and value-added services due to increasing competition among the app-based service providers. Regulators can also emphasize passenger quality services and the importance of money as a proposition while formulating policy and regulations toward the management of ride-sharing companies.},

@article{chung_2021_understanding_host_marketing_strategies_on_airbnb_and_their_impact_on_listing_performance_a_text_analytics_approach,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Peer-to-peer (P2P) accommodation sharing has become a significant part of the travel and lodging industry, allowing homeowners to engage in entrepreneurial activity via sharing of resources. However, there is limited understanding of how hosts can use listing descriptions to better match their offerings to different consumer segments. The purpose of this paper is to understand the use of listing descriptions by Airbnb hosts and the impact of such descriptions on sales performance.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              In this paper, a deep learning-based sentence-level aspect mining approach is used to extract various aspects from host-provided listing descriptions. Then a regression-based approach is used to understand the impact of various aspects of listing descriptions on listing performance.
            
            
              Findings
              It was found that aspects for which listing descriptions are the sole source of information have the greatest influence on listing performance. The authors also find that the impact of an aspect on listing performance varies by listing type, and that there is a mismatch between the most included aspects by hosts in their listing descriptions and the most influential aspects that impact sales.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The impact of consumer reviews in the context of Airbnb has been extensively studied. A novel aspect of this study is the exploration of P2P accommodations from a supplier perspective, by understanding the use and impact of host-provided textual descriptions on sales. The findings of this study can help better market properties from a practice perspective and better understand consumer information consumption from a theoretical perspective. The authors also demonstrate a new approach for exploring social phenomena by performing quantitative analysis on textual data using deep-learning and regression-based techniques.},

Using a text mining process and qualitative content analysis of 549 comments posted to a LinkedIn online discussion board, we identified six key themes; three were tied to camera and microphone issues, two involved eating and meeting management issues, and one dealt with work-from-home issues. These themes are discussed in relationship to media naturalness theory and meeting science. Because widespread use of videoconferencing will likely continue, we provide guidance for workplace policies/practices and suggest directions for future research.},

@article{shamim_2021_multi_attribute_online_decision_making_driven_by_opinion_mining,
	abstract = {With the evolution of data mining systems, the acquisition of timely insights from unstructured text is an organizational demand which is gradually increasing. The existing opinion mining systems have a variety of properties, such as the ranking of products' features and feature level visualizations; however, organizations require decision-making based upon customer feedback. Therefore, an opinion mining system is proposed in this work that ranks reviews and features based on novel ranking schemes with innovative opinion-strength-based feature-level visualization, which are tightly coupled to empower users to spot imperative product features and their ranking from enormous reviews. Enhancements are made at different phases of the opinion mining pipeline, such as innovative ways to evaluate review quality, rank product features and visualize opinion-strength-based feature-level summary. The target user groups of the proposed system are business analysts and customers who want to explore customer comments to gauge business strategies and purchase decisions. Finally, the proposed system is evaluated on a real dataset, and a usability study is conducted for the proposed visualization. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of review and feature ranking can improve the decision-making process.},

The data was collected from the SCTM 3.0 (smart crawling and text mining) platform developed by the Wellness \& Tourism Big Data Institute at Kyungsung University. A total of 2051 online reviews were collected from the period from 29 October 2018 to 29 October 2021. The following steps were conducted by RStudio and UCINET 6.0 to analyze the collected data and to visualize the results. The results showed the top 50 keywords customers used in the reviews, such as `great', `amazing', or `service'. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and linear regression analysis were applied for an in-depth understanding of customer satisfaction. The analysis results demonstrated that the `value' and `dining' factors had a negative influence on overall customer satisfaction. These findings could provide managerial and marketing insights for upscale hotel managers when formulating and implementing strategies and tactics to improve customer satisfaction.},

	abstract = {This study explored the conceptual constructs of consumer benefits and perceived risks of online fashion rental services (Online FRS) and their impacts on usage intention towards Online FRS. The mediating roles of perceived risks and service trust were examined in this research. A survey was performed on female shoppers between the ages of 20--30 residing in a metropolitan area. Results of this research were as follows: (1) The results analyzing the sub-dimension of benefits (Reasonable cost, Wearing at right time, place and occasion (TPO), Space Saving, Entertaining, Product Variety, Style Conformity) and perceived risks (Financial, Performance, Social) clearly presented factorial structures. (2) Reasonable cost, Style Conformity, and Product Variety showed significantly positive influences on usage intentions towards online fashion rental services; in addition, Financial, Performance, and Social risks of rental services had a negative effect on usage intentions. (3) Service trust and consumer perceptions of Financial and Performance risks had important mediating roles in the relationship between consumer benefits and usage intentions towards Online FRS. This study highlighted that consumer benefits, perceived risks, and service trust should be registered among consumers to boost usage intentions towards Online FRS.},

@article{papagiannidis_2021_bringing_smart_home_technology_to_peer_to_peer_accommodation_exploring_the_drivers_of_intention_to_stay_in_smart_accommodation,
	abstract = {Abstract
            COVID-19 has caused disruptions in the sharing economy for both platforms and owners, who are typically micro-businesses. Lower demand and ample supply means that users have a great deal of choice. Finding ways for properties to differentiate themselves has been a pressing need. Against this background, this paper pursued two objectives: firstly to explore the perceived functional and emotional value of smart accommodation and the factors contributing to this by adopting the Theory of Consumption Values, and secondly to examine the role of perceived value in driving intention to stay in smart accommodation in the future. 430 responses were collected to analyse the relationships among antecedents, value and intention. The results showed that the functional value of smart accommodation is associated with the perception that such accommodation represents good value for the price, smart devices are useful, they can enhance control of stay experiences, and there are resources and opportunities facilitating the use of technology. Emotional value is determined by the perception that staying in smart accommodation represents sustainable behaviour, the integration of smart home technologies offers control over the stay experience, improves the entertainment experience, aesthetics and playfulness of using technology. Emotional values are inhibited by the perception of surveillance in smart accommodation. Also, the study offers evidence of the correlation of intention with functional and emotional value. The evidence contributes to the literature by explaining the potential implications of innovative technologies for business recovery in the post-pandemic reality, exploring the applications of smart technologies in delivering tourism services, and identifying the factors in the adoption of smart homes in the hospitality sector. The findings provide practical implications for facilitating the applications of innovative technology and its adoption in home and non-home environments.},

@article{chowdhury_2022_a_decision_model_for_efficient_service_design_in_the_sharing_economy_a_service_triad_perspective,
	abstract = {Purpose
              Sharing economy-based service platforms are a relatively new way of delivering services that have received increasing attention from both practitioners and researchers. However, current research in the area is still developing in terms of offering practical insight in conjunction with a decision model that may help to determine optimal strategies for efficient service design in the sharing economy from a service triad perspective. Exploring this gap in the literature, this paper aims to develop and apply a decision model that enables managers to identify and prioritise the efficiency attributes of sharing economy-based services. It also aids in designing optimal strategies to enhance efficiency over time based on the insights obtained from users (buyers and sellers) and platform providers.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study adopts a mixed-methods approach. The qualitative approach comprised an extensive literature review followed by in-depth interviews, and the quantitative approach adopted the quality function deployment (QFD) integrated optimisation technique to design and prioritise the most optimal strategy emanating from the application of a decision model.
            
            
              Findings
              The findings revealed that establishing global distribution, continued technological research and development (R\&D) and enhancing the transactional platform are the most important strategies in the context of sharing economy platform providers (e.g. accommodation-based-platform service providers). This study also revealed that as the importance weights of the efficiency attributes changed over time, so too did the portfolio of strategies used to attain an optimal efficiency level.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The decision model brings a richer conceptual understanding of the dynamic changes over time that occur in the business ecosystem. It also allows managers of sharing economy-based platforms to select optimal strategies and make astute decisions towards achieving efficient service design.},

Firstly, we collect product review data from shopping websites, social media, product communities, and other online platforms to identify product competitors with the help of word-frequency cooccurrence technology. We take mobile phones as an example to mine and analyze product competition information. Then, we calculate the product review quantity, review emotion value, product-network heat, and price statistics and establish the regression model of online product review forecasts. In addition, the neural-network model is established to suggest that the relationships among factors are linear. On the basis of analyzing and discussing the impact of product sales of the competitors, product price, the emotional value of the reviews, and product-network popularity, we construct the sales forecast model. Finally, to verify the validity of the factor analysis affecting the sales and the rationality of the established model, actual sales data are used to further analyze and verify the model, showing that the model is reasonable and effective.},

	abstract = {This study aims to examine key attributes affecting Airbnb users' satisfaction and dissatisfaction through the analysis of online reviews. A corpus that comprises 59,766 Airbnb reviews form 27,980 listings located in 12 different cities is analyzed by using both Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and supervised LDA (sLDA) approach. Unlike previous LDA based Airbnb studies, this study examines positive and negative Airbnb reviews separately, and results reveal the heterogeneity of satisfaction and dissatisfaction attributes in Airbnb accommodation. In particular, the emergence of the topic ``guest conflicts'' in this study leads to a new direction in future sharing economy accommodation research, which is to study the interactions of different guests in a highly shared environment. The results of topic distribution analysis show that in different types of Airbnb properties, Airbnb users attach different importance to the same service attributes. The topic correlation analysis reveals that home like experience and help from the host are associated with Airbnb users' revisit intention. We determine attributes that have the strongest predictive power to Airbnb users' satisfaction and dissatisfaction through the sLDA analysis, which provides valuable managerial insights into priority setting when developing strategies to increase Airbnb users' satisfaction. Methodologically, this study contributes by illustrating how to employ novel approaches to transform social media data into useful knowledge about customer satisfaction, and the findings can provide valuable managerial implications for Airbnb practitioners.},

@article{zloteanu_2021_judgments_in_the_sharing_economy_the_effect_of_user_generated_trust_and_reputation_information_on_decision_making_accuracy_and_bias,
	abstract = {The growing ecosystem of peer-to-peer enterprise -- the Sharing Economy (SE) -- has brought with it a substantial change in how we access and provide goods and services. Within the SE, individuals make decisions based mainly on user-generated trust and reputation information (TRI). Recent research indicates that the use of such information tends to produce a positivity bias in the perceived trustworthiness of fellow users. Across two experimental studies performed on an artificial SE accommodation platform, we test whether users' judgments can be accurate when presented with diagnostic information relating to the quality of the profiles they see or if these overly positive perceptions persist. In study 1, we find that users are quite accurate overall (70\%) at determining the quality of a profile, both when presented with full profiles or with profiles where they selected three TRI elements they considered useful for their decision-making. However, users tended to exhibit an ``upward quality bias'' when making errors. In study 2, we leveraged patterns of frequently vs. infrequently selected TRI elements to understand whether users have insights into which are more diagnostic and find that presenting frequently selected TRI elements improved users' accuracy. Overall, our studies demonstrate that -- positivity bias notwithstanding -- users can be remarkably accurate in their online SE judgments.},

Foram encontrados dois tipos de postagens que mais chamam aten{\c c}{\~a}o das noivas: enfoque na est{\'e}tica e enfoque na estrutura tur{\'\i}stica. Identificaram-se ainda quatro tipos principais de influenciadores de destinos tur{\'\i}sticos de lua de mel presentes no Instagram. Evidenciou-se que as postagens sobre viagens no Instagram atuam de forma relevante na decis{\~a}o de compra de um destino tur{\'\i}stico de lua de mel, pois os usu{\'a}rios que postam atuam como cocriadores das estrat{\'e}gias mercadol{\'o}gicas de conte{\'u}do, mesmo sem ter inten{\c c}{\~a}o desta influ{\^e}ncia. Por fim, foi desenvolvido um framework do processo de decis{\~a}o de compra de um destino tur{\'\i}stico de lua de mel que mostrou que o Instagram {\'e} uma ferramenta essencial, pois o processo de decis{\~a}o de compra se inicia nele antes da viagem e no final {\'e} retornado a ele atrav{\'e}s das postagens ap{\'o}s ou durante as viagens.},
