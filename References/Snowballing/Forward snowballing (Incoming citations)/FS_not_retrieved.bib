@article{hamdi_towards_2022,
	abstract = {With the evaluation of the software industry, a huge number of software applications are designing, developing, and uploading to multiple online repositories. To find out the same type of category and resource utilization of applications, researchers must adopt manual working. To reduce their efforts, a solution has been proposed that works in two phases. In first phase, a semantic analysis-based keywords and variables identification process has been proposed. Based on the semantics, designed a dataset having two classes: one represents application type and the other corresponds to application keywords. Afterward, in second phase, input preprocessed dataset to manifold machine learning techniques (Decision Table, Random Forest, OneR, Randomizable Filtered Classifier, Logistic model tree) and compute their performance based on TP Rate, FP Rate, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, MCC, ROC Area, PRC Area, and Accuracy (\%). For evaluation purposes, We have used an R language library called latent semantic analysis for creating semantics, and the Weka tool is used for measuring the performance of algorithms. Results show that the random forest depicts the highest accuracy which is 99.3\% due to its parametric function evaluation and less misclassification error.},

@article{jin_user-based_2022,
	abstract = {With the development of the Internet and mobile networks, social networks have gradually become an essential tool and widespread application. Therefore, the research on short text semantic modelling of social networks has attracted widespread attention. However, modelling short texts encounter the semantics sparsity and multiple meanings of a word in social networks. To solve the above problems, we propose a user-based topic model with topical word embeddings semantic modelling method, namely SM-UTM. Firstly, we construct the user topic model to aggregate short text. Secondly, we build word pair in the user topic model to alleviate semantics sparsity in social networks. In addition, we introduce the time information of social networks into the topic model to jointly constrain the generation process of topics, to improve the quality of semantic representation of social network short texts. Finally, we use the topic word embedding learning based on deep learning to train and optimize the word vector according to the learning results of the user topic model, to alleviate the problem of polysemy in social networks. We build multiple groups of quantitative and qualitative experiments based on the crawled real Sina Weibo data. The experimental results show that our SM-UTM is significantly better than the comparison method in the evaluation indicators of topic consistency, purity and entropy.},

@article{xu_disambiguating_2022,
	abstract = {The definition of `transformative innovation' is still ambiguous, making it difficult to develop more targeted strategies for steering scientific and technological innovation. In this study, taking extant academic publications as our research object, we used topic extraction and visualisation tools to explore the intersections and differences among transformative and other innovative concepts. The correlation degrees among the concepts related to `transformative innovation' were used to distinguish the relationships among concepts related to `breakthrough innovation' and `disruptive innovation'. We further analysed the definitional differences among `transformative innovation', `emerging technology' and `groundbreaking research'. The results showed that the concepts of `breakthrough innovation' and `disruptive innovation' can be integrated into the scope of `transformative innovation'. However, the definitions of `transformative innovation', `emerging technology' and `research frontier' had their distinct characteristics. `Transformative innovation' focused on major impactful technological changes. `Emerging technology' focused on novel technology and its promoting. `Research frontier' focused on research activities taking place at the frontiers of knowledge. Therefore, distinctive science and technology (S\&T) policies are needed for the different types of innovation. This article introduces a novel multidimensional method to place the different concepts associated with `transformative innovation' into a unified framework. This framework is expected to support policymakers in their S\&T policymaking, and it would aid the work of S\&T researchers.},

@article{lokku_optimized_2022,
	abstract = {Abstract Facial expression recognition (FER) is the process of identifying human expressions. People vary in their accuracy at recognizing the emotions of others. Use of technology to help people with emotion recognition is a relatively important research area. Various works have been conducted on automating the recognition of facial expressions. The main intent of this paper is to plan for the FER model with the aid of intelligent techniques. The proposed models consist of steps like data collection, face detection, optimized feature extraction and emotion recognition. Initially, the standard benchmark facial emotion dataset is collected, and it is subjected to face detection. The optimized scale-invariant feature transform (OSIFT) is adopted for feature extraction, in which the key points that are giving unique information are optimized by the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm. Two meta-heuristic algorithms like spotted hyena optimization and beetle swarm optimization (BSO) are merged to form the proposed spotted hyena-based BSO (SH-BSO). Also, the local tri-directional pattern is extracted, which is further combined with optimized SIFT. Here, the proposed SH-BSO is utilized for optimizing the number of hidden neurons of both deep neural network and convolutional neural network in such a way that the recognition accuracy could attain maximum.},
