@article{jin_topic_2022,
	abstract = {Short text clustering is a challenging and important task in many practical applications. However, many Bag-of-Word--based methods for short text clustering are often limited by the sparsity of text representation, while many sentence embedding--based methods fail to capture the document structure dependencies within a text corpus. In considerations of the shortcomings of many existing studies, a topic attention encoder (TAE) is proposed in this study. Given topics derived from corpus by the techniques of topic modelling, the cross-document information is introduced. This encoder assumes the document-topic vector to be the learning target and the concatenating vectors of the word embedding and corresponding topic-word vector to be the input. Also, a self-attention mechanism is employed in the encoder, which aims to extract weights of hidden states adaptively and encode the semantics of each short text document. With captured global dependencies and local semantics, TAE integrates the superiority of Bag-of-Word methods and sentence embedding methods. Finally, categories of benchmarking experiments were conducted by analysing three public data sets. It demonstrates that the proposed TAE outperforms many document representation benchmark methods for short text clustering.},

@article{tsoumou_impoliteness_2022,
	abstract = {Abstract Digital discourse has emerged as a substantial focus of interest within the pragmatic field. Specifically, (im)politeness practices on social media have increasingly received scholarly attention in the last decade (Tagg, Caroline, Philip Seargeant \& Amy Aisha Brown. 2017. Taking offence on social media. Conviviality and conviviality and communication on Facebook. Switzerland: Springer Nature, Palgrave McMillan; Tsoumou, Jean Mathieu. 2020. Analyzing speech acts in politically related Facebook communication. Journal of Pragmatics 167. 80--97). However, research combining COVID-19, Facebook and (im)politeness in a politically polarizing context is still scarce. This paper is an analysis of (im)politeness in Facebook comments posted as reactions to Giuliani's COVID diagnosis. Thus, by combining quantitative and qualitative approaches, the aim of the present paper is twofold: On the one hand, it intends to further our understanding of the manifestation of (im)politeness practices on Facebook through an analysis of reactive comments to Giuliani's Covid-19 diagnosis on BBC news Facebook page. On the other hand, the paper aims to examine how the struggle between impoliteness and politeness divides Facebook users between sympathizers and detractors of the patient. Through a metadiscursive analysis, the identified (im)politeness items are distributed in an uneven fashion, with impoliteness-oriented items prevailing as the dominant macro category against politeness-oriented ones. The findings suggest that users employ different strategies to express or intensify (im)politeness, favoring explicit expressions of impoliteness such as redress/agreement, insults, pointed criticisms/complaints, unpalatable questions and/or presuppositions over others like threats.},

@article{yadav_decoding_2022,
	abstract = {This study uses aspect level sentiment analysis using lexicon-based approach to analyse online reviews of an Indian brand called Patanjali, which sells many FMCG products under its name. These reviews have been collected from the microblogging site twitter from where a total of 4961 tweets about ten Patanjali branded products have been extracted and analysed. Along with the aspect level sentiment analysis, an opinion tagged corpora has also been developed. Machine learning approaches - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Na{\"\i}ve Bayes have also been used to perform the sentiment analysis and to figure out the appropriate classifiers suitable for such product reviews analysis. Authors first identify customer preferences and / or opinions about a product or brand by analyisng online customer reviews as they express them on social media platform, twitter by using aspect level sentiment analysis. Authors also address the limitations of scarcity of opinion tagged data, required to train supervised classifiers to perform sentiment analysis by developing tagged corpora.},

Using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to dissect the Twitter conversation aimed at Representative Karen Bass, the sponsor of the H.R.7120, in the weeks leading up to the bill's filing, our analysis of nearly 68,000 tweets posted in the days before the bill's filing reveals that constituents strongly urged the Representative to work on legislation targeted on police reform -- offering evidence of how constituents demanded, and drove, legislative action. Considering our findings, we argue that there is considerable potential for social media to serve as an amplifier of social issues and concerns among constituents. Through this process, we posit that social media can prove to be a vital catalyst in social justice reform.},

	abstract = {Due to the massive number of products being produced every year in every industry, firms have witnessed a tremendous growth in innovation of methods to create a sustainable competitive advantage. For the past decade and with the availability of online consumer reviews, companies and researchers have developed many approaches utilizing electronic Word-of-Mouth to improve and develop products and services to outperform competitors. The purpose of this study is to construct an effective method to perform a better product comparative analysis based on online consumer reviews. We propose a novel framework called Teardown Joint Sentiment-Topic analysis model consisting of a combination of text analytical approaches incorporated with a developed method of the traditional teardown analysis product comparative approach. The proposed approach is fully unsupervised model that employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling to form topics which are classified according to their sentiments. Topics are then analyzed against competitive products and critical topics are identified using a developed teardown method. A case study analyzing online customer reviews of competing products in two domains (i.e., mobile phones and surveillance cameras) is conducted. The identified critical topics are further analyzed in view of products' specifications perspective. We found that the detected aspects of the selected products are indeed critical, and hence, they need to be improved in order to gain a competitive advantage. The significant result of this study shows that the proposed method is effective in conducting products comparative analysis and provides valuable insights into utilizing the consumer reviews for product development.},

	abstract = {Objective - In the current time of pandemic crisis, social media is one of the most effective tools for ecommerce to keep in touch with customers. One of the most affected segments worldwide is undoubtedly the tourist segment. Our goal was to examine the perception of selected aspects of social media in the light of gender differences during a pandemic in the tourist segment, when these can convince or discourage the customer to buy. Methodology/Technique - Data collection took place from the beginning of 2021 and lasted 3 months. It was an online questionnaire and focused on customers of travel agencies. A total of 723 valid responses were collected. These were analyzed for statistical significance of gender differences using SPSS software. Findings - The results identified significant differences in perceptions between men and women in some of the areas examined. The best forms of content that work best on these platforms have been identified. Attitudes towards communication through social media for marketing purposes were also identified. These were perceived positively in order to support purchasing decisions. We also identified a great need for personalization in communication via social media in a given tourist segment. Novelty - All findings show great implication potential for both theory and practice. The pandemic situation has changed market conditions and many of these changes will persist beyond. There is therefore a need to examine these contexts in the future. Managers in the tourism segment are able to incorporate the identified results into the way they manage their online activities and manage their social media. Type of Paper - Empirical Keywords: Social Media; Ecommerce; Tourism; Pandemic; Differences; Analysis. JEL Classification: M31, M39.},

To find out the same type of category and resource utilization of applications, researchers must adopt manual working. To reduce their efforts, a solution has been proposed that works in two phases. In first phase, a semantic analysis-based keywords and variables identification process has been proposed. Based on the semantics, designed a dataset having two classes: one represents application type and the other corresponds to application keywords. Afterward, in second phase, input preprocessed dataset to manifold machine learning techniques (Decision Table, Random Forest, OneR, Randomizable Filtered Classifier, Logistic model tree) and compute their performance based on TP Rate, FP Rate, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, MCC, ROC Area, PRC Area, and Accuracy (\%). For evaluation purposes, We have used an R language library called latent semantic analysis for creating semantics, and the Weka tool is used for measuring the performance of algorithms. Results show that the random forest depicts the highest accuracy which is 99.3\% due to its parametric function evaluation and less misclassification error.},

	abstract = {With the development of the Internet and mobile networks, social networks have gradually become an essential tool and widespread application. Therefore, the research on short text semantic modelling of social networks has attracted widespread attention. However, modelling short texts encounter the semantics sparsity and multiple meanings of a word in social networks. To solve the above problems, we propose a user-based topic model with topical word embeddings semantic modelling method, namely SM-UTM. Firstly, we construct the user topic model to aggregate short text. Secondly, we build word pair in the user topic model to alleviate semantics sparsity in social networks. In addition, we introduce the time information of social networks into the topic model to jointly constrain the generation process of topics, to improve the quality of semantic representation of social network short texts. Finally, we use the topic word embedding learning based on deep learning to train and optimize the word vector according to the learning results of the user topic model, to alleviate the problem of polysemy in social networks. We build multiple groups of quantitative and qualitative experiments based on the crawled real Sina Weibo data. The experimental results show that our SM-UTM is significantly better than the comparison method in the evaluation indicators of topic consistency, purity and entropy.},

@article{xu_disambiguating_2022,
	abstract = {The definition of `transformative innovation' is still ambiguous, making it difficult to develop more targeted strategies for steering scientific and technological innovation. In this study, taking extant academic publications as our research object, we used topic extraction and visualisation tools to explore the intersections and differences among transformative and other innovative concepts. The correlation degrees among the concepts related to `transformative innovation' were used to distinguish the relationships among concepts related to `breakthrough innovation' and `disruptive innovation'. We further analysed the definitional differences among `transformative innovation', `emerging technology' and `groundbreaking research'. The results showed that the concepts of `breakthrough innovation' and `disruptive innovation' can be integrated into the scope of `transformative innovation'. However, the definitions of `transformative innovation', `emerging technology' and `research frontier' had their distinct characteristics. `Transformative innovation' focused on major impactful technological changes. `Emerging technology' focused on novel technology and its promoting. `Research frontier' focused on research activities taking place at the frontiers of knowledge. Therefore, distinctive science and technology (S\&T) policies are needed for the different types of innovation. This article introduces a novel multidimensional method to place the different concepts associated with `transformative innovation' into a unified framework. This framework is expected to support policymakers in their S\&T policymaking, and it would aid the work of S\&T researchers.},

	abstract = {Abstract Text preprocessing is not only an essential step to prepare the corpus for modeling but also a key area that directly affects the natural language processing (NLP) application results. For instance, precise tokenization increases the accuracy of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and retaining multiword expressions improves reasoning and machine translation. The text corpus needs to be appropriately preprocessed before it is ready to serve as the input to computer models. The preprocessing requirements depend on both the nature of the corpus and the NLP application itself, that is, what researchers would like to achieve from analyzing the data. Conventional text preprocessing practices generally suffice, but there exist situations where the text preprocessing needs to be customized for better analysis results. Hence, we discuss the pros and cons of several common text preprocessing methods: removing formatting, tokenization, text normalization, handling punctuation, removing stopwords, stemming and lemmatization, n-gramming, and identifying multiword expressions. Then, we provide examples of text datasets which require special preprocessing and how previous researchers handled the challenge. We expect this article to be a starting guideline on how to select and fine-tune text preprocessing methods.},

	abstract = {Abstract Objectives The focus of this paper is to introduce an automated early Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) detection scheme from colour fundus images through enhanced segmentation and classification strategies by analyzing blood vessels. Methods The occurrence of DR is increasing from the past years, impacting the eyes due to a sudden rise in the glucose level of blood. All over the world, half of the people who are under age 70 are severely suffered from diabetes. The patients who are affected by DR will lose their vision during the absence of early recognition of DR and appropriate treatment. To decrease the growth and occurrence of loss of vision, the early detection and timely treatment of DR are desirable. At present, deep learning models have presented better performance using retinal images for DR detection. In this work, the input retinal fundus images are initially subjected to pre-processing that undergoes contrast enhancement by Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and average filtering. Further, the optimized binary thresholding-based segmentation is done for blood vessel segmentation. For the segmented image, Tri-level Discrete Level Decomposition (Tri-DWT) is performed to decompose it. In the feature extraction phase, Local Binary Pattern (LBP), and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCMs) are extracted. Next, the classification of images is done through the combination of two algorithms, one is Neural Network (NN), and the other Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The extracted features are subjected to NN, and the tri-DWT-based segmented image is subjected to CNN. Both the segmentation and classification phases are enhanced by the improved meta-heuristic algorithm called Fitness Rate-based Crow Search Algorithm (FR-CSA), in which few parameters are optimized for attaining maximum detection accuracy. Results The proposed DR detection model was implemented in MATLAB 2018a, and the analysis was done using three datasets, HRF, Messidor, and DIARETDB. Conclusions The developed FR-CSA algorithm has the best detection accuracy in diagnosing DR.},

	abstract = {Abstract Facial expression recognition (FER) is the process of identifying human expressions. People vary in their accuracy at recognizing the emotions of others. Use of technology to help people with emotion recognition is a relatively important research area. Various works have been conducted on automating the recognition of facial expressions. The main intent of this paper is to plan for the FER model with the aid of intelligent techniques. The proposed models consist of steps like data collection, face detection, optimized feature extraction and emotion recognition. Initially, the standard benchmark facial emotion dataset is collected, and it is subjected to face detection. The optimized scale-invariant feature transform (OSIFT) is adopted for feature extraction, in which the key points that are giving unique information are optimized by the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm. Two meta-heuristic algorithms like spotted hyena optimization and beetle swarm optimization (BSO) are merged to form the proposed spotted hyena-based BSO (SH-BSO). Also, the local tri-directional pattern is extracted, which is further combined with optimized SIFT. Here, the proposed SH-BSO is utilized for optimizing the number of hidden neurons of both deep neural network and convolutional neural network in such a way that the recognition accuracy could attain maximum.},
