	abstract = {Blockchain (BC), the technology behind the Bitcoin crypto-currency system - is starting to be adopted for ensuring enhanced security and privacy in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Fervent research is currently being focused in both academia and industry in this domain. Proof-of-Work (PoW), a cryptographic puzzle, plays a vital r{\^o}le in ensuring BC security by maintaining a digital ledger of transactions, which are considered to be incorruptible. Furthermore, BC uses a changeable Public Key (PK) to record the identity of users -- thus providing an extra layer of privacy. Not only in crypto-currency has the successful adoption of the BC been implemented, but also in multifaceted non-monetary systems, such as in: distributed storage systems, proof-of-location and healthcare. Recent research articles and projects/applications were surveyed to assess the implementation of the BC for IoT Security and identify associated challenges and propose solutions for BC enabled enhanced security for the IoT ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Language processing of Sanskrit presents various challenges in the field of computational linguistics. Prosodical, orthographic and inflectional complexities encountered in Sanskrit texts makes it difficult to apply linguistic analysis methods relevant for western European languages. The inadequacy of contemporary computational approaches in the analysis of Sanskrit language is vivdly apparent. In this exposition, we focus on the challenge of learning syntactic and semantic similarities in a rich Sanskrit literature. We present a simple yet effective approach of representing Sanskrit words in a continuous vector space. We utilise word embeddings in similarity, compositionality and visualization tasks to test its efficacy. Experiments show that our method produces interpretable vector offsets exhibiting shared relationships.},
