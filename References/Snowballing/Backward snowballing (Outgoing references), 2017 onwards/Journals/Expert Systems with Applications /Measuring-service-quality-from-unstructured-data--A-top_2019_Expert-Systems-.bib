@article{NGOYE201798,
	abstract = {In this paper, we examine the utility of script analysis for predicting the helpfulness of online customer reviews. We employ the lens of cognitive scripts and posit that people share a cognitive script for what constitutes a helpful review in a given domain. Conceptually, a script includes the salient elements that readers look for before determining whether a review is helpful. To operationalize the construct of cognitive script, we seek the help of human annotators and ask them to highlight phrases that they believe are important for determining review helpfulness. The words in the annotated phrases are collected and become part of the script lexicon for a given domain. The lexicon entries represent the shared conception of essential elements, which are key to the evaluation of review helpfulness. We employ the words in the script lexicon as features in a text regression model to predict review helpfulness. Furthermore, we develop and empirically validate a new approach for combining script analysis and dimension reduction. The purpose of the study is to propose a new method to predict review helpfulness and to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the scripts-enriched model. To demonstrate the efficacy of the scripts-enriched model, we compare it with benchmark models -- a Baseline model and a bag-of-words (BOW) model. The results show that the scripts-enriched text regression model not only produces the highest accuracy, but also the lowest training, testing, and feature selection times.},

	abstract = {Even at an early stage, diverse big data have been applied to tourism research and made an amazing improvement. This paper might be the first attempt to present a comprehensive literature review on different types of big data in tourism research. By data sources, the tourism-related big data fall into three primary categories: UGC data (generated by users), including online textual data and online photo data; device data (by devices), including GPS data, mobile roaming data, Bluetooth data, etc.; transaction data (by operations), including web search data, webpage visiting data, online booking data, etc. Carrying different information, different data types address different tourism issues. For each type, a systematical analysis is conducted from the perspectives of research focuses, data characteristics, analytic techniques, major challenges and further directions. This survey facilitates a thorough understanding of this sunrise research and offers valuable insights into its future prospects.},

	abstract = {Product defects can have a devastating impact on a firm's sales and reputation, especially in the era of social media. The early detection of defects could not only protect consumers from financial losses, but could also mitigate financial damage to the manufacturer. Previous work in automated defect discovery has had success in the automotive, consumer electronics, and toy industries, but so far there has been no application to home appliances. In this study, we extend the text analytic framework conceived in earlier work to the discovery of underperformance in large home appliances, specifically dishwashers. We find that generic cross-domain sentiment techniques can be strongly complemented by domain-specific ``smoke'' and ``sparkle'' term lists that are highly correlated with potential defects. These findings can be highly beneficial to improving dishwasher appliance quality management methods.},

@article{LEE201828,
	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that user-generated online contents can be used as an alternative data source for assessing airport service quality, which effectively complements and cross-validates the conventional service quality surveys. We apply sentiment analysis and topic modeling technique to 42,137 reviews collected from Google Maps. The results are compared to the well-publicized ASQ ratings conducted by Airport Council International. The sentiment scores computed from the textual Google reviews are very good predictors of the associated Google star ratings, with rs(96) = 0.89, p < .01 in 2016. The correlation could be further improved (rs(96) = 0.90) by customizing the sentiment lexicon leveraging the information gained from the previous year's analysis. Also, both the sentiment scores and Google star ratings are found to have a reasonably strong association with the ASQ ratings, with rs(78) = 0.63, p < .01 and rs(78) = 0.64, p < .01, respectively, in 2016, excluding outliers. These results indicate that the online reviews provide a good proxy for airport service quality ratings and an effective means to cross-validate the conventional industry standard survey results. Further, the study extracts 25 latent topics from the Google reviews through a topic modeling analysis. The 25 topics show good correspondence with the ASQ service attributes, suggesting that the ASQ program effectively covers all the service quality attributes of airport users. Also, further analysis indicates that the relative importance of service attributes varies depending on the size of the airports and that some ASQ service attributes may not be relevant anymore for most passengers.},

@article{KUHN2018105,
	abstract = {The Aviation Safety Reporting System includes over a million confidential reports describing aviation safety incidents. Natural language processing techniques allow for relatively rapid and largely automated analysis of large collections of text data. Interpretation of the results and further investigations by subject matter experts can produce meaningful results. This explains the many commercial and academic applications of natural language processing to aviation safety reports. Relatively few published articles have, however, employed topic modeling, an approach that can identify latent structure within a corpus of documents. Topic modeling is more flexible and relies less on subject matter experts than alternative document categorization and clustering methods. It can, for example, uncover any number of topics hidden in a set of incident reports that have been, or would be, assigned to the same category when using labels and methods applied in earlier research. This article describes the application of structural topic modeling to Aviation Safety Reporting System data. The application identifies known issues. The method also reveals previously unreported connections. Sample results reported here highlight fuel pump, tank, and landing gear issues and the relative insignificance of smoke and fire issues for private aircraft. The results also reveal the prominence of the Quiet Bridge Visual and Tip Toe Visual approach paths at San Francisco International Airport in safety incident reports. These results would, ideally, be verified by subject matter experts before being used to set priorities when planning future safety studies.},

	abstract = {Recently, the Internet has brought a big change in tourists' behavior patterns. Travelers not only reserve hotels and airline tickets online, but also exchange travel information and descriptions of pleasant or unpleasant travel experiences through online review sites and personal travel blogs. In spite of the increasing use of online channels, application of online text data has been limited since the volume of the data set is too large to analyze manually and comprehensively. With recent technological advances in processing big data online, consumer-generated information can be automatically analyzed by artificial intelligence. As an aspect of smart tourism, this study applied the sentiment analysis method to analyze travelers' online reviews of Paris. A total of 19,835 pieces of review data collected from a traveler review site (www.virtualtourist.com) were processed. All reviews were grouped into 14 categories as follows: overview, restaurants, sightseeing, hotels, things to do, night life, transportation, shopping, sporting & outdoors, favorites, off the beaten path, what to pack, tourist traps, warnings and danger, and local customs. Tourists' perception about the service in each category was successfully measured, and as an illustration, we chose ``transportation'' category that reported relatively low level of service quality for post-hoc analysis to reveal why tourists feel negatively about the transportation service.},

However, advanced techniques for linguistic analysis provide the opportunity to extract meaning from the valuable comments provided by visitors. In this paper, we identify the key dimensions of customer service voiced by hotel visitors use a data mining approach, latent dirichlet analysis (LDA). The big data set includes 266,544 online reviews for 25,670 hotels located in 16 countries. LDA uncovers 19 controllable dimensions that are key for hotels to manage their interactions with visitors. We also find differences according to demographic segments. Perceptual mapping further identifies the most important dimensions according to the star-rating of hotels.

Customer sentiment refers to the emotions expressed by customers through the text reviews. These sentiments can be positive, negative or neutral. The study explores customer sentiments and expresses them in terms of customer sentiment polarity. Our results find consistency between customer ratings and actual customer feelings across hotels belonging to the two categories of premium and budget. Customer sentiment polarity explains significant variation in customer ratings across both the hotel categories. With regard to managerial implications, the study finds that, when compared with premium hotels, managers of budget hotels should improve their staff performance and hotel services. The present study is not exhaustive and other factors like customer review length and review title sentiment can be analyzed for their effects on customer ratings.},
