	abstract = {This study used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to analyze pre-service teachers'views on the nature of science (NOS). This approach can be used to automate the classification of documents, and at the same time, the researcher does not need to deduce with a NOS framework prior to evaluation. Participants were 155 pre-service teachers studying at the Shandong Normal University in China. To gather our data, we used an open questionnaire, namely, the Views of Nature of Science Questionnaire---Form C (VNOS-C). LDA topic modeling was used to classify the document, which was divided into 12 topics. By comparing the LDA topic modeling results with the theoretical framework behind the VNOS-C questionnaire, we categorized these 12 topics into eight descriptive aspects of the NOS: The Empirical Nature of Scientific Knowledge, Observation, Inference, and Theoretical Entities in Science, Scientific Theories and Laws, The Theory-Laden Nature of Scientific Knowledge, The Social and Cultural Embeddedness of Scientific Knowledge, The Myth of The Scientific Method, The Tentative Nature of Scientific Knowledge, and The Nature of Scientific Theory. The results show that pre-service teachers usually hold naive or mixed views of the NOS. In addition, each aspect of NOS is not independent of each other but interrelated and influencing each other. In the future, more consideration can be given to the relationship between each aspect of NOS.},

@article{Kukreja:2022aa,
	abstract = {Given the ubiquity of handwriting and mathematical content in human transactions, machine recognition of handwritten mathematical text and symbols has become a domain of great practical scope and significance. Recognition of mathematical expression (ME) has remained a challenging and emerging research domain, with mathematical symbol recognition (MSR) as a requisite step in the entire recognition process. Many variations in writing styles and existing dissimilarities among the wide range of symbols and recurring characters make the recognition tasks strenuous even for Optical Character Recognition. The past decade has witnessed the emergence of recognition techniques and the peaking interest of several researchers in this evolving domain. In light of the current research status associated with recognizing handwritten math symbols, a systematic review of the literature seems timely. This article seeks to provide a complete systematic analysis of recognition techniques, models, datasets, sub-stages, accuracy metrics, and accuracy details in an extracted form as described in the literature. A systematic literature review conducted in this study includes pragmatic studies until the year 2021, and the analysis reveals Support Vector Machine (SVM) to be the most dominating recognition technique and symbol recognition rate to be most frequently deployed accuracy measure and other interesting results in terms of segmentation, feature extraction and datasets involved are vividly represented. The statistics of mathematical symbols-related papers are shown, and open problems are identified for more advanced research. Our study focused on the key points of earlier research, present work, and the future direction of MSR.},

	abstract = {The debate about the relationship between economic growth and environmental sustainability triggers a range of associations. Here we analyze open-ended textual responses of citizens and scientists concerning their associations with the terms ``economic growth'' and ``green growth''. We derive from the responses a number of topics and examine how associations differ across distinct opinion segments of people, namely supporters of Green growth, Agrowth and Degrowth. The results indicate that the general public is more critical of the notion of economic growth than academic researchers. Citizens stress problems of corruption, social inequality, unemployment and poverty, with less variation among the three opinion segments compared to scientists. The latter more strongly emphasize the environmental consequences of economic growth. Concerning associations of scientists with the term ``green growth'', we find topics questioning its feasibility to be more likely expressed by Degrowth supporters, while topics stressing the possibility of sustainable economic growth by Green growth supporters. We find that topic polarization is stronger for scientists than citizens. Our results provide further validation for opinion clusters identified in previous studies and uncover additional insights about related views on growth and sustainability.},

@article{SAKSHI2021104292,
	abstract = {Context:
Many scientific and technical literature documents contain MSs and MEs that are more challenging to be recognized by computers than plain text. The recognition of HMSE becomes not only an ambitious task but a motivating research area covering concepts of computer vision, pattern recognition, feature extraction, and artificial intelligence.
Objective:
The objective is to perform an extensive state of the art on the techniques and methods used for recognizing and classifying HMSE. The authors endeavor to bring out all significant findings in sub-processes, representation models, algorithms, tools, datasets, and comparative analysis of the accuracy of the recognition models.
Method:
The current research implements the standard SLR method based on a comprehensive set of 120 articles published in 21 leading journals and 39 premier conferences and workshops.
Results:
Existing literature about recognition techniques and models is classified broadly into three categories; AI technique (65%) is majorly implemented in the selected studies. The prominent sub-process `segmentation' (52%) is mostly used. The box and tree are the prevailing representation models. The popular datasets are recognized as CROHME 2014 and CROHME 2016, used by 60% of the selected studies. Masaki Nakagawa, C. Viard Guardin, Richard Zanibbi, and Harold Mouchere are the most noticed authors in ME recognition.
Conclusion:
The reviewers call for increased awareness of the potential benefits of existing and emerging recognition techniques and identify the need to develop a more accurate and semantic-based recognition model. Recommendations are given for future research.},

	abstract = {Automatic text summarization is an exertion of contriving the abridged form of a text document covering salient knowledge. Numerous statistical, linguistic, rule-based, and position-based text summarization approaches have been explored for different rich-resourced languages. For under-resourced languages such as Hindi, automatic text summarization is a challenging task and still an unsolved problem. Another issue with such languages is the unavailability of corpus and the inadequacy of the processing tools. In this paper, we proposed an extractive lexical knowledge-rich topic modeling text summarization approach for Hindi novels and stories in which we implemented four independent variants using different sentence weighting schemes. We prepared a corpus of Hindi Novels and stories since the absence of a corpus. We used a smoothing technique for edifying and variety summaries followed by evaluating the efficacy of generated summaries against three metrics (gist diversity, retention ratio, and ROUGE score). The results manifest that the proposed model produces abridge, articulate and coherent summaries. To investigate the performance of the proposed model, we simulate the experiments on the English dataset as well. Further, we compare our models with the baselines and traditional topic modeling approach, where we show that the proposed model has confessed optimal results.},

	abstract = {The main assay tool of COVID-19, as a pandemic, still has significant faults. To ameliorate the current situation, all facilities and tools in this realm should be implemented to encounter this epidemic. The current study has endeavored to propose a self-assessment decision support system (DSS) for distinguishing the severity of the COVID-19 between confirmed cases to optimize the patient care process. For this purpose, a DSS has been developed by the combination of the data-driven Bayesian network (BN) and the Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM). First, all of the data are utilized to extract the evidence-based paired (EBP) relationships between symptoms and symptoms'impact probability. Then, the results are evaluated in both independent and combined scenarios. After categorizing data in the triple severity levels by self-organizing map, the EBP relationships between symptoms are extracted by BN, and their significance is achieved and ranked by FCM. The results show that the most common symptoms necessarily do not have the key role in distinguishing the severity of the COVID-19, and extracting the EBP relationships could have better insight into the severity of the disease.},

@article{Leong:2021aa,
	abstract = {Purpose In the literature of industrial management, the focus is normally given on examining the factors that contribute to product innovation acceptance. The advocates of ``pro-innovation bias''assume that consumers are open to new products and are willing to accept an innovative product. However, there is a high failure rate of technological innovations and most of the technological innovations were rejected due to users' resistance. Since the inception of innovation resistance theory (IRT), the number of studies that used IRT has gained much attention from scholars. However, the findings from these studies from various contexts are inconsistent, lack universality, and a clear understanding of technological innovation barriers. The study aims to determine whether the IRT theory is indeed valid and whether IRT is culturally invariant from the Eastern and Western cultures. Design/methodology/approach A meta-analysis based on a random-effects model and studies drawn from 24 countries and/or regions with a consolidated sample size of 10,463 was conducted. Cultural invariance was identified based on subgroup analysis. Moderator analysis was performed by applying the weighted linear regression. Findings The results reveal that tradition is the strongest barrier followed by the value, risk, image and usage barrier. Interestingly, there is a cultural invariance in IRT from the Eastern and Western cultures. Besides, there are significant moderating effects due to the temporal factor. Originality/value The study has contributed useful theoretical and managerial implications in advancing the product innovation literature.},

	abstract = {Light food refers to healthy and nutritious food that has the characteristics of low calorie, low fat, and high fiber. Light food has been favored by the public, especially by the young generation in recent years. Moreover, affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, consumers' awareness of a healthy diet has been improved to a certain extent. As both take-out and in-place orders for light food are growing rapidly, there are massive customer reviews left on the Meituan platform. However, massive, multi-dimensional unstructured data has not yet been fully explored. This research aims to explore the customers' focal points and sentiment polarity of the overall comments and to investigate whether there exist differences of these two aspects before and after the COVID-19. A total of 6968 light food customer reviews on the Meituan platform were crawled and finally used for data analysis. This research first conducted the fine-grained sentiment analysis and classification of the light food customer reviews via the SnowNLP technique. In addition, LDA topic modeling was used to analyze positive and negative topics of customer reviews. The experimental results were visualized and the research showed that the SnowNLP technique and LDA topic modeling achieve high performance in extracting the customers' sentiments and focal points, which provides theoretical and data support for light food businesses to improve customer service. This research contributes to the existing research on LDA modeling and light food customer review analysis. Several practical and feasible suggestions are further provided for managers in the light food industry.},

	abstract = {Recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions (MEs) is an important problem that has wide applications in practice. Handwritten ME recognition is challenging due to the variety of writing styles and ME formats. As a result, recognizers trained by optimizing the traditional supervision loss do not perform satisfactorily. To improve the robustness of the recognizer with respect to writing styles, in this work, we propose a novel paired adversarial learning method to learn semantic-invariant features. Specifically, our proposed model, named PAL-v2, consists of an attention-based recognizer and a discriminator. During training, handwritten MEs and their printed templates are fed into PAL-v2 simultaneously. The attention-based recognizer is trained to learn semantic-invariant features with the guide of the discriminator. Moreover, we adopt a convolutional decoder to alleviate the vanishing and exploding gradient problems of RNN-based decoder, and further, improve the coverage of decoding with a novel attention method. We conducted extensive experiments on the CROHME dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of each part of the method and achieved state-of-the-art performance.},

@article{Julca-Aguilar:2020aa,
	abstract = {We revisit graph grammar and graph parsing as tools for recognizing graphics. A top-down approach for parsing families of handwritten graphics containing different kinds of symbols and of structural relations is proposed. It has been tested on two distinct domains, namely the recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions and of handwritten flowcharts. In the proposed approach, a graphic is considered as a labeled graph generated by a graph grammar. The recognition problem is translated into a graph parsing problem: Given a set of strokes (input data), a parse tree which represents the best interpretation is extracted. The graph parsing algorithm generates multiple interpretations (consistent with the grammar) that can be ranked according to a global cost function that takes into account the likelihood of symbols and structures. The parsing algorithm consists in recursively partitioning the stroke set according to rules defined in the graph grammar. To constrain the number of partitions to be evaluated, we propose the use of a hypothesis graph, built from data-driven machine learning techniques, to encode the most likely symbol and relation hypotheses. Within this approach, it is easy to relax the stroke ordering constraint allowing interspersed symbols, as opposed to some previous works. Experiments show that our method obtains accuracy comparable to methods specifically developed to recognize domain-dependent data.},

	abstract = {Recognition of Handwritten Mathematical Expressions (HMEs) is a challenging problem because of the ambiguity and complexity of two-dimensional handwriting. Moreover, the lack of large training data is a serious issue, especially for academic recognition systems. In this paper, we propose pattern generation strategies that generate shape and structural variations to improve the performance of recognition systems based on a small training set. For data generation, we employ the public databases: CROHME 2014 and 2016 of online HMEs. The first strategy employs local and global distortions to generate shape variations. The second strategy decomposes an online HME into sub-online HMEs to get more structural variations. The hybrid strategy combines both these strategies to maximize shape and structural variations. The generated online HMEs are converted to images for offline HME recognition. We tested our strategies in an end-to-end recognition system constructed from a recent deep learning model: Convolutional Neural Network and attention-based encoder-decoder. The results of experiments on the CROHME 2014 and 2016 databases demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our strategies: our hybrid strategy achieved classification rates of 48.78% and 45.60%, respectively, on these databases. These results are competitive compared to others reported in recent literature. Our generated datasets are openly available for research community and constitute a useful resource for the HME recognition research in future.},

In order to overcome the limitations, this paper proposes a research paper classification system that can cluster research papers into the meaningful class in which papers are very likely to have similar subjects. The proposed system extracts representative keywords from the abstracts of each paper and topics by Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) scheme. Then, the K-means clustering algorithm is applied to classify the whole papers into research papers with similar subjects, based on the Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) values of each paper.},

@article{Phan:2018aa,
	abstract = {This paper presents an augmented incremental recognition method for online handwritten mathematical expressions (MEs). If an ME is recognized after all strokes are written (batch recognition), the waiting time increases significantly when the ME becomes longer. On the other hand, the pure incremental recognition method recognizes an ME whenever a new single stroke is input. It shortens the waiting time but degrades the recognition rate due to the limited context. Thus, we propose an augmented incremental recognition method that not only maintains the advantage of the two methods but also reduces their weaknesses. The proposed method has two main features: one is to process the latest stroke, and the other is to find the erroneous segmentations and recognitions in the recent strokes and correct them. In the first process, the segmentation and the recognition by Cocke--Younger--Kasami (CYK) algorithm are only executed for the latest stroke. In the second process, all the previous segmentations are updated if they are significantly changed after the latest stroke is input, and then, all the symbols related to the updated segmentations are updated with their recognition scores. These changes are reflected in the CYK table. In addition, the waiting time is further reduced by employing multi-thread processes. Experiments on our dataset and the CROHME datasets show the effectiveness of this augmented incremental recognition method, which not only maintains recognition rate even compared with the batch recognition method but also reduces the waiting time to a very small level.},

	abstract = {Purpose The immense quantity of available unstructured text documents serve as one of the largest source of information. Text classification can be an essential task for many purposes in information retrieval, such as document organization, text filtering and sentiment analysis. Ensemble learning has been extensively studied to construct efficient text classification schemes with higher predictive performance and generalization ability. The purpose of this paper is to provide diversity among the classification algorithms of ensemble, which is a key issue in the ensemble design. Design/methodology/approach An ensemble scheme based on hybrid supervised clustering is presented for text classification. In the presented scheme, supervised hybrid clustering, which is based on cuckoo search algorithm and k-means, is introduced to partition the data samples of each class into clusters so that training subsets with higher diversities can be provided. Each classifier is trained on the diversified training subsets and the predictions of individual classifiers are combined by the majority voting rule. The predictive performance of the proposed classifier ensemble is compared to conventional classification algorithms (such as Na{\"\i}ve Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines and C4.5 algorithm) and ensemble learning methods (such as AdaBoost, bagging and random subspace) using 11 text benchmarks. Findings The experimental results indicate that the presented classifier ensemble outperforms the conventional classification algorithms and ensemble learning methods for text classification. Originality/value The presented ensemble scheme is the first to use supervised clustering to obtain diverse ensemble for text classification},

	abstract = {Designing systems for/with marginalized populations requires innovation and the integration of sophisticated domain knowledge with emergent technologies and trends. Researchers need to be cognizant of existing research trends when aspiring to design interventions to build on current and emergent needs. Traditional manual mechanisms for revealing developments in a field, such as systematic literature reviews (SLRs), cannot meet this challenge because they are time and effort intensive and the domain itself is dynamic and ever expanding. This compromises the efficacy of SLRs in keeping up with the growing academic literature. A number of emergent technologies and modern methods exist that could be harnessed to make it possible to monitor the field more effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we propose the use of natural language processing (NLP), an AI-powered text analysis technique that operates efficiently and requires limited human intervention. To investigate the use and usefulness of NLP for identifying research themes, we applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic modelling technique that uses a probabilistic model to find the co-occurrence patterns of terms that correspond to semantic topics. We applied it to a collection of 176 articles published in the Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D) field. We demonstrate the usefulness of the LDA method by comparing the findings of the LDA analysis to those of a manual analysis carried out by researchers. While NLP techniques may not be able to replace SLRs at this stage, we share some insights on how NLP techniques can complement SLRs to offset investigator bias and save time and effort in revealing emerging domain-related themes.},
