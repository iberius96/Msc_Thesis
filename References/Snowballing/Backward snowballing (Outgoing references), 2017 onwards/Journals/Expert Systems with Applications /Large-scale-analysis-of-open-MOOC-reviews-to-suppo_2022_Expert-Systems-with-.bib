	abstract = {With the popularization development of MOOC platform, the number of online courses grows rapidly. Efficient and appropriate course recommendation can improve learning efficiency. Traditional recommendation system is applied to the closed educational environment in which the quantity of courses and users is relatively stable. Recommendation model and algorithm cannot directly be applied to MOOC platform efficiently. With the light of the characteristics of MOOC platform, MCRS proposed in this paper has made great improvement in the course recommendation model and recommendation algorithm. MCRS is based on distributed computation framework. The basic algorithm of MCRS is distributed association rules mining algorithm, which based on the improvement of Apriori algorithm. In addition, it is useful to mine the hidden courses rules in course enrollment data. Firstly, the data is pre-processed into a standard form by Hadoop. It aims to improve the efficiency of the basic algorithm. Then it mines association rules of the standard data by Spark. Consequently, course recommendation information is transferred into MySQL through Sqoop, which makes timely feedback and improves user's courses retrieval efficiency. Finally, to validate the efficiency of MCRS, a series of experiments are carried out on Hadoop and Spark, and the results shows that MCRS is more efficient than traditional Apriori algorithm and Apriori algorithm based on Hadoop, and the MCRS is suitable for current MOOC platform.},

@article{VANITHA2019325,
	abstract = {In e-learning, learning object sequencing is a challenging task. It is difficult to sequence learning objects manually due to their abundant availability and the numerous combinations possible. An adaptive e-learning system that offers a personalized learning path would enhance the academic performance of learners. The main challenge in providing a personalized learning path is finding the right match between individual characteristics and learning content sequences. This paper presents a collaborative optimization algorithm, combining ant colony optimization and a genetic algorithm to provide learners with a personalized learning path. The proposed algorithm utilizes the stochastic nature of ant colony optimization and exploration characteristics of the genetic algorithm to build an optimal solution. Performance of the proposed algorithm has been assessed by conducting qualitative and quantitative experiments. This study establishes that the hybrid approach provides a better solution than the traditional approach.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, technology is affecting every aspect of our society in different manner. However, the technology impact is more tangible in the field of education. Technological advances are transforming the way education is being delivered. Courses are not limited for those who are attending university or school classes. The proliferation of Web Technologies and the exploration of the possibilities of Technology Enhance Learning (TEL) led to the development of many learning solutions and recently to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). MOOCs are capable of providing several ten thousands of learners with access to courses over the web. Recently, there are many MOOCs providers/platforms with different features and characteristics. Online learners are exposed to various challenges with this excess of those MOOCs providers. This paper presents a system that is built in the top of MOOCs providers to act as a single point of access to those providers. This system is twofold: first, it will improve the learning process for any online learner in a way that satisfies the learner needs when searching for suitable courses among different providers; It will help users not to be lost in the overwhelming offers of MOOCs. Second, it will recommend courses related to the previous experiences of its users.},

This article, written as an editorial introduction to a special issue includes works related to control measurement and ethical behavior, misbehaviors in finances and accounting, professionalism in accounting, ethical investing and corporate reporting. We conclude by suggesting further research for a better integration of technical aspects of accounting and finances into business activity---human activity actually---and an for understanding of ethics not limited to rules, but as a mutual and interdependent system of values (human goods), virtues and principles.},

@article{LI2022104354,
	abstract = {MOOC platforms have seen significant membership growth in recent years. MOOCs are leading the education world that has been digitized, remote, and highly competitive, and the competition is intense in the MOOC world. Based on the observation for top-rated MOOCs, this study proposes a research question, ``What makes a great MOOC? What makes a hit?'' To explore the answers, this study applies a crowdsourcing approach and interprets the semantics of reviews for the top-rated courses on Coursera.org. The paper has multiple steps and findings relevant to MOOC programs at universities worldwide. First, through exploratory analysis of learner reviews and expert judgment, this study identifies two distinct course categories focusing on learners' outcome intent, namely knowledge-seeking MOOCs and skill-seeking MOOCs. Further, this study uses a topical ontology of keywords and sentiment techniques to derive the intent of learners based on their comments. Through sentiment analysis and correlation analysis, it shows that knowledge-seeking MOOCs are driven by the quality of course design and materials. Skill-seeking MOOCs are driven by the instructor and their ability to present lectures and integrate course materials and assignments. This crowdsourcing method obtains the insights from large samples of learners' reviews without the priming or self-selection biases of open surveys or interviews. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging online learner reviews and offer practical implications for what truly ``makes a hit'' for top-rated MOOCs.},

	abstract = {This study attempted to mitigate the gap in literature concerning the use of social media for active collaborative learning and engagement and its effect on the research students' learning performance in the context of Malaysia. A questionnaire based on Constructivism Theory and the Technology Acceptance Model was employed as the main data collection method, which was distributed to 723 research students in five Malaysian research universities. Based on the obtained results, male and female students' satisfaction of social media use for collaborative learning and engagement positively affected their learning performance, although in the case of females, they were not fully satisfied with perceived ease of use and usefulness. The study concludes that overall, active collaborative learning and engagement through social media enriches the learning activities of students and facilitates group discussions, and hence, their use should be encouraged in learning and teaching processes in higher education institutions.},

Consequently, the extant, peer-reviewed literature relating to MOOCs was methodically assessed, as a means of formulating a classification for MOOC-focused scholarly literature. The publication journal, country of origin, researchers, release data, theoretical approach, models, methodology and study participants were all factors used to assess and categorise the MOOC. These data contribute to materials required by readers who are interested in different aspects related to the literature of using Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in higher education. Intention to use, interaction, engagement, motivations and satisfaction were five dynamics assessed in relation to the improvement of MOOCs. Students' academic performance can be influenced by MOOC which has the advantage of facilitating the learning process through offering materials and enabling the share of information.},
