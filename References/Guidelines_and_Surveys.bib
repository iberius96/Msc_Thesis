	abstract = {Topic models have been applied to everything from books to newspapers to social media posts in an effort to identify the most prevalent themes of a text corpus. We provide an in-depth analysis of unsupervised topic models from their inception to today. We trace the origins of different types of contemporary topic models, beginning in the 1990s, and we compare their proposed algorithms, as well as their different evaluation approaches. Throughout, we also describe settings in which topic models have worked well and areas where new research is needed, setting the stage for the next generation of topic models.},

@article{2022_Chauhan,
	abstract = {We are not able to deal with a mammoth text corpus without summarizing them into a relatively small subset. A computational tool is extremely needed to understand such a gigantic pool of text. Probabilistic Topic Modeling discovers and explains the enormous collection of documents by reducing them in a topical subspace. In this work, we study the background and advancement of topic modeling techniques. We first introduce the preliminaries of the topic modeling techniques and review its extensions and variations, such as topic modeling over various domains, hierarchical topic modeling, word embedded topic models, and topic models in multilingual perspectives. Besides, the research work for topic modeling in a distributed environment, topic visualization approaches also have been explored. We also covered the implementation and evaluation techniques for topic models in brief. Comparison matrices have been shown over the experimental results of the various categories of topic modeling. Diverse technical challenges and future directions have been discussed.},

@article{2021_Silva,
	abstract = {Topic modeling using models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a text mining technique to extract human-readable semantic ``topics''(i.e., word clusters) from a corpus of textual documents. In software engineering, topic modeling has been used to analyze textual data in empirical studies (e.g., to find out what developers talk about online), but also to build new techniques to support software engineering tasks (e.g., to support source code comprehension). Topic modeling needs to be applied carefully (e.g., depending on the type of textual data analyzed and modeling parameters). Our study aims at describing how topic modeling has been applied in software engineering research with a focus on four aspects: (1) which topic models and modeling techniques have been applied, (2) which textual inputs have been used for topic modeling, (3) how textual data was ``prepared''(i.e., pre-processed) for topic modeling, and (4) how generated topics (i.e., word clusters) were named to give them a human-understandable meaning. We analyzed topic modeling as applied in 111 papers from ten highly-ranked software engineering venues (five journals and five conferences) published between 2009 and 2020. We found that (1) LDA and LDA-based techniques are the most frequent topic modeling techniques, (2) developer communication and bug reports have been modelled most, (3) data pre-processing and modeling parameters vary quite a bit and are often vaguely reported, and (4) manual topic naming (such as deducting names based on frequent words in a topic) is common.},

@article{2016_Chen,
	abstract = {Researchers in software engineering have attempted to improve software development by mining and analyzing software repositories. Since the majority of the software engineering data is unstructured, researchers have applied Information Retrieval (IR) techniques to help software development. The recent advances of IR, especially statistical topic models, have helped make sense of unstructured data in software repositories even more. However, even though there are hundreds of studies on applying topic models to software repositories, there is no study that shows how the models are used in the software engineering research community, and which software engineering tasks are being supported through topic models. Moreover, since the performance of these topic models is directly related to the model parameters and usage, knowing how researchers use the topic models may also help future studies make optimal use of such models. Thus, we surveyed 167 articles from the software engineering literature that make use of topic models. We find that i) most studies centre around a limited number of software engineering tasks; ii) most studies use only basic topic models; iii) and researchers usually treat topic models as black boxes without fully exploring their underlying assumptions and parameter values. Our paper provides a starting point for new researchers who are interested in using topic models, and may help new researchers and practitioners determine how to best apply topic models to a particular software engineering task.},

@article{2015_Petersen,
	abstract = {Context
Systematic mapping studies are used to structure a research area, while systematic reviews are focused on gathering and synthesizing evidence. The most recent guidelines for systematic mapping are from 2008. Since that time, many suggestions have been made of how to improve systematic literature reviews (SLRs). There is a need to evaluate how researchers conduct the process of systematic mapping and identify how the guidelines should be updated based on the lessons learned from the existing systematic maps and SLR guidelines.
Objective
To identify how the systematic mapping process is conducted (including search, study selection, analysis and presentation of data, etc.); to identify improvement potentials in conducting the systematic mapping process and updating the guidelines accordingly.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study of systematic maps, considering some practices of systematic review guidelines as well (in particular in relation to defining the search and to conduct a quality assessment).
Results
In a large number of studies multiple guidelines are used and combined, which leads to different ways in conducting mapping studies. The reason for combining guidelines was that they differed in the recommendations given.
Conclusion
The most frequently followed guidelines are not sufficient alone. Hence, there was a need to provide an update of how to conduct systematic mapping studies. New guidelines have been proposed consolidating existing findings.},

@article{2012_Vicente,
	abstract = {A new size-independent indicator of scientific journal prestige, the SJR2 indicator, is proposed. This indicator takes into account not only the prestige of the citing scientific journal but also its closeness to the cited journal using the cosine of the angle between the vectors of the two journals' cocitation profiles. To eliminate the size effect, the accumulated prestige is divided by the fraction of the journal's citable documents, thus eliminating the decreasing tendency of this type of indicator and giving meaning to the scores. Its method of computation is described, and the results of its implementation on the Scopus 2008 dataset is compared with those of an ad hoc Journal Impact Factor, JIF(3y), and SNIP, the comparison being made both overall and within specific scientific areas. All three, the SJR2 indicator, the SNIP indicator and the JIF distributions, were found to fit well to a logarithmic law. Although the three metrics were strongly correlated, there were major changes in rank. In addition, the SJR2 was distributed more equalized than the JIF by Subject Area and almost as equalized as the SNIP, and better than both at the lower level of Specific Subject Areas. The incorporation of the cosine increased the values of the flows of prestige between thematically close journals.},
